# Precision Oncology and The Development of Oncology

- Modern Advancements in Radiology have been to make radiotherapy more targeted so that radiation is delivered only to the tumour without damaging nearby healthy cells (E.g Proton Beam Therapy)

### Development of Oncology

- Paul Ehrlich first described mechanisms of chemical and biological therapeutics
- He isolated the first alkylating agent in 1898 and is considered by many to be the ‘Father of Chemotherapy’

### Mustard Gas - Alkylating Agent

- First Synthesised in 1854
- Noted to be vesicant (caused blisters) in 1887
- First used in Chemical Warfare by Germans on 12-13th July 1973 at Ypres

### First Patients Treated

- 1944 - Mr JD (48 Yr Old Silversmith) with Lymphosacrcoma, Cervical and Axillary Lymphadenopathy and SVCO
- Treated with Nitrogen Mustard
- Tumours regressed and JD lived 2 months before dying of Marrow failure
- Next Px had no response and died of marrow failure
- Marrow Failure was common as the high proliferating rate of bone marrow meant that it was vulnerable to damage by Alkylating Agents
- Pubication was delayed until 1946 as ‘top secret’

### Coley’s Toxins

- 1891 - Injected concotion of bacteria/bacteria products in Px with bone cancers
- Some responses and many died
- He is known as the ‘Father of Immunotherapy’

# Mechanism of Action of Cytotoxins

- Antimetabolites like 5-Fluorouracil inhibit DNA Synthesis
- Intercalating Agents such as Cisplatin and Platinum inhibit DNA Transcription and Replication
- Spindle Poisons like Taxanes and Vincristine inhibit Mitosis and hence, Cell Proliferatin
- Alkylating Agents like Cyclophosphamide and Topoisomerase Inhibitors like Etoposide also inhibit DNA Synthesis

# Chemotherapy and the Cell Cycle

- As different Chemotherapy Drugs impact different aspects of the Proliferation Cycle of Cancerous Cells, they also act to stop cell growth at different points in the Cell Cycle

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 16.51.43.png](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_16.51.43.png)

# Clinical Evaluation of New Agents

- The clinical evaluation of cytotoxic agents spans four phases, each with defined objectives and patient populations.
- In Phase I, non-comparative clinical studies are designed to identify the maximum tolerated dose and key toxicities in small groups of patients with various tumor types.
- Phase II studies are non-comparative trials (Cohort Studies) conducted to evaluate tumor response and determine if the drug is sufficiently promising/efficacious to warrant Phase III studies
- Phase II studies are somewhat larger than Phase I studies and enroll patients with more uniform disease characteristics.
- Phase III studies (Usually RCT Trials) expand the experience with new agents through efficacy and safety comparisons with standard therapies, which support marketing approval
- These studies typically involve hundreds of patients who have a single tumor type, but represent a broader patient pool than do Phase II studies.
- Phase IV studies are conducted post-approval to integrate findings from earlier clinical studies into general clinical practice with particular emphasis on safety monitoring in very large cohorts of hundreds or thousands of patients who represent the general clinical population.

# Combination Chemotherapy

- Many Chemotherapy drugs are effective when used alone but they are often synergistic with one another, potentiating their effects
- To prevent high magnitude side effects, Combination Chemotherapy should use drugs with non-overlapping side effects to prevent significant strength side effects from arising
- Ideally, drugs should be used at optimal dose and schedule them accordingly based on what phase in the Cell Cycle they act in order to produce the most potent proliferation block
- Combination Chemotherapies were mostly developed through trial and error to see which combinations were most efficaious with minimal side effects

### Chemo-Sensitivity of Cancers

**Good Response**

- Testicular germ cell tumours
- Lymphoma (Small cell lung cancer)

**Intermediate Response**

- Colorectal cancer
- Breast cancer

**Poor Response**

- Malignant melanoma
- Renal cancer
- Pancreatic cancer
- Prostate cancer (androgen insensitive)
- In the 1970s, Survival Rate from Testicular Cancer was 69% but due to the development of Platinum Based Chemotherapy, Survival Rate is now 98%

---

# Mechanisms of Drug Resistance

- Impaired Transport of Drug into the Malignant Cell/Increased Transport of the Drug out of the cell - Methotrexate
- Impaired Drug Activation by Enzymes - Cytarabine
- Increased Drug Inactivation by Enzymes - Alkylating Agents
- Improved DNA Repair - Platinum
- Gene Amplification - Methotrexate

### Tailor Made Chemotherapy

- DPD (Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase) deficiencies increase the risk of toxicity arising if a Px is prescribed fluoropyrimidines like 5-Fluorouracil so DPD testing is regularly done for cancers where Fluoropyrimidine usage is indicated to minimise these toxic effects
- BRCA associated tumours are more sensitive to platinum therapies and PARP inhibitors as BRCA-Associated Tumours have impaired Homologous Recombination, which are targeted by these therapies

---

# Biomarkers

- Biomarkers = Characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacological response to a therapeutic intervention
- They must be accurate, validated, reproduceable and Practical to measure in order to be a valid indicator of pharmacological/pathophysiological processes whilst also clinically useful

### Prognostic Biomarkers

- Originally defined as “a biomarker that provides information on the likely course of the cancer disease in an untreated individual”
- Now “a biomarker that is associated with overall outcome independent of intervention or therapy” - a proven independent, significant factor, that is easy to determine and interpret and has therapeutic consequences

### Predictive Biomarker

- Originally defined as “A biomarker that can be used to identify a population most likely to respond to a given therapy” - “A biomarker that gives information on the effect (positive or negative) of a therapeutic intervention on the prognosis of a condition”

### Pharmacodynamic Biomarker

- “A Biomarker that reports on the consequence(s) of compound (biological) interaction with the target” In a Tumour or Surrogate Tissues (AKA reports the efficacy of the medication)

### Importance

- Patient Diagnosis of specific cancer type
- Patient Selection
- Tumour Classification
- Treatment Selection
- Drug Development
- Prognostic Biomarkers are useful as they can indicate the likely outcome of the Px following Rx and without Rx for the Cancer to indicate the intensity of Rx required to produce a good outcome
- Predictive Biomarkers are useful as they can indicate what Chemotherapies will be most efficacious in a Px

# Molecular Biomarkers - HER Family

- HER1 = EGFR
- Transmembrane series of receptors with an extracellular domain that can be targeted by Ab and an intracellular domain where small molecular Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors that can enter the cell can bind to, so that they can inhibit downstream signalling that when deregulated/overexpressed, give rise to the Hallmarks of Cancer

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 17.34.19.png](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_17.34.19.png)

### Complexity of HER Receptor Signalling

- AKT is invovled in the regulation of cell cycle through phosphorylation of cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27 via increased translation of Cyclin D1.
- Phosphorylation results in p21 and p27 accumulation in the cytoplasm (inhibiting nuclear translocation and thus activity)
- AKT also induces anti-apoptotic signalling.
- AKT signalling is a major downstream pathway in EGFR overexpressing tumours and is one of the major pathways involved in radio-resistance since AKT mediates activation of DNAPK (via phosphorylation) and to stimulate efficient DNA-DSB repair.
- MAPK signalling is thought to propergate EGFR signalling by inducing production of EGFR ligands.

# HER2 Expression in Breast Cancer

- HER2 Overexpression is seen in around 25% of Breast Cancers

![Untitled](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Untitled%202.png)

### HER-2 Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (FISH)

- This overexpression of HER2 could be confirmed by FISH, where an increased number of HER2 Signals produced by the Probes indicates overexpression of HER2 within the Tumour Cells

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 17.36.43.png](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_17.36.43.png)

### HER-2 Expression Is A Negative Prognositc Factor In Breast Cancer

- As the degree of HER2 Overexpression in Breast Cancer increases, Pxs tend to die younger and have a poorer outcome following Rx

![Untitled](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Untitled%203.png)

# Strategies Targetting HER2

- HER2 therapeutic targets include the extracellular portion of the receptor, HER2 dimerization, the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor, and downstream signaling pathways
- HER2 has been successfully targeted in breast cancer and is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.

### Targeting the Extracellular Domain of HER2

- Molecules such as monoclonal antibodies would bind to the extracellular domain of HER2 to suppress its activity
- This would prevent phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain of HER2 and therefore preclude the initiation of downstream signaling pathways

### Targeting HER2 Dimerization

- Molecules such as monoclonal antibodies would bind to the extracellular domain of HER2, preventing it from dimerizing with other HER family receptors
- This would prevent activation of HER2-containing dimers and their associated downstream signaling pathways
- By preventing HER2/HER3 dimers in particular, this strategy may address the potential for tumor cells to escape other HER2 inhibition strategies through HER2/HER3 dimerization

### Targeting the Intracellular Domain of The Receptor

- Small molecule Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors can prevent transphosphorylation/crossphosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domain of HER2
- Without transactivation of dimerized receptors, downstream signaling pathways are not initiated

![Untitled](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Untitled%204.png)

### Chemotherapy + Trastuzumab Vs Chemotherapy - Overall Survival

- When Px were given Trastuzumab alongside Chemotherapy, there was reduced mortality over time associated with Breast Cancer

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 17.44.22.png](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_17.44.22.png)

### Example of Biomarkers

# EGFR Expression In Lung Cancer

- EGFR is a poor prognostic marker for Lung Cancer, where Px with EGFR +ve Lung Cancer are more likely to die younger and have a shorter survival-period/prognosis after Rx than those with EGFR -ve disease
- However, EGFR Could not be used as a predictive biomarker for the development of Targeted Therapies to help improve prognosis and therefore, it has not shown clinical usefulness yet

![Untitled](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Untitled%206.png)

- In Colorectal Cancer, Targeting EGFR with Cetuximab (Inhibits EGFR by binding to its Extracellular Domain) alongside Chemotherapy showed reduced mortality in a small subset population that was not related to whether Px have EGFR +ve or EGFR -ve Colorectal Cancer but rather, whether KRAS (Protein involved in Downstream Stages of EGFR Signalling) was mutated or not → Where Px had Wild Type KRAS, Cetuximab was effective and where Px had Mutated KRAS, Cetuximab did not improve survival
- Cetuximab did not show effectiveness in Px with Cancers containing mutated KRAS as Mutated KRAS is overexpressed and not regulated by EGFR Activation and therefore, Inhibition of EGFR is unlikely to impact the expression of Mutated KRAS and therefore, is unlikely to show any survival benefit by inhibiting Intracellular Signalling Mechanism that drive Malignant Transformation and Cancer Growth
- Therefore, KRAS can be used as a predictive Biomarker to see whether a Px will respond to Cetuximab Therapy will be effective and improve prognosis or not

### Target Populations in Lung Adenocarcinoma

- KRAS is the most common mutation seen in Lung Adenocarcinomas (Almost 25% of Pxs) however, drugs that Target EGFR Signalling have not shown effectiveness in improving Survival for Px with Lung Adenocarcinoma and hence, are not used
- However, it has been demonstrated that 54% of Px with Lung Adenocarcinoma have a single driver/GoF mutation in EGFR

![Untitled](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Untitled%207.png)

### EGFR Mutations In the Kinase Domain Are Associated With Response To EGFR TKI

- These driver mutations are mainly Exon 19 Deletions or Exon 21 Substitution
- Therefore, the role of Overactive EGFR Signalling in Lung Adenocarcinoma means that TKIs may show effectiveness in the Rx of Lung Adenocarcinoma

![Untitled](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Untitled%208.png)

# Molecular Targets - IPASS

- When Gefitinib (TKI) was given to Px with Lung Adenocarcinoma without selection of Px based on the presence of other Biomarkers, Gefitinib did not produce significant improvement on survival
- However, when Px were selected based on Clinical Characteristics alongside EGFR Mutation Status meaning that they are more likely to be responsive to Gefitinib (E.g Px who have little/no Hx of Smoking)

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 17.50.49.png](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_17.50.49.png)

### IPASS Study Results

- For Px who had EGFR Mutations that led to EGFR Overactivity. Gefitinib produced a significant improval in Progression Free Survival
- However, If the Px did not have an EGFR Mutation, Gefitinib was less efficacious than Traditional Chemotherapy, causing significant reductions in Progression Free Survival

---

# Novel Toxicities

- Targeted therapies have different toxicity profiles to chemotherapy, arising due to on target and off target effects of the Therapy
- E.g Initial EGFR Inhibitors targeted EGFR Signalling in the Skin and GI Tract as well as that in the Tumour, producing an Acneiform Rash and Diarrhoea respectively → On Target Effect

### Biomarkers of Toxicity → Efficacy - EGFR Inhibitors and Rash

- In some cases, the degree of Toxicity seen with a Targeted Therapy can be used as a predictive biomarker to indicate the effiacy of the Therapy as for EGFR Inhibitors, the Severity/Grade of the Rash was correlated with a reduction in cancer associated mortality, indicating a more successful/efficacious Rx

# Human and Cancer Genome

### Human Genome

- Human Genome Sequencing has allowed for the identification of specific driver genetic mutations seen in various types of cancer, providing new indication on the potential pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the Oncogenesis and Tumour Growth, hence providing potential targeted drug therapies which can be used to Rx the Cancer

![Untitled](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Untitled%2010.png)

### Cancer Genome

- Better understanding of the Mutation Profile of a specific type of tumour allows for more accurate classification of cancers, earlier Dx of the Cancers via the early identification of Driver Genetic Mutatons as well as improved understanding of the Alterations in Intracellular Signalling that underly Carcinogenesis

![Untitled](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Untitled%2011.png)

# Use of DNA Sequencing To Map Tumour Heterogeneity

- The Histological Heterogeneity of a Cancer can be used to identify DNA Heterogeneity in various regions of a cancer via the sequencing of biopsies taken from Histologically different regions of a cancer and from Metastases over a period of time and tracking genetic changes in their genomes
- This allows for the generation of a Phylogenetic Tree of the various Histologically distinct regions of a Tumour to analyse the evolution of the Cancer over time within the body and how its genetic profile has changed whilst it has proliferated within the Px
- From a Phylogenetic Tree, Early Mutations present within the Cancer are likely to be found in multiple different Histological Regions of the Cancer whilst later mutations within the Cancer are likely to be specific to different histologically distinct regions of the Tumour
- Therefore, the Identification of Early Mutations that are present in all/the Majority of the Malignant Cells provide Better Drug Targets than Later Mutations that are specific to only some regions of the Cancer as Targeting Earlier Mutations allows for the Majority of Cancer Cells to be Targeted so that the Rx is more effective

![Untitled](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Untitled%2012.png)

# Future Advances - Liquid Biopsies

- Instead of needing to take Tissue Biopsies from the Primary Tumour and Multiple Biopsies in order to sequence their Genomes to produce a Phylogenetic Tree to identify Common/Early Mutations, Samples of the Cancer Genome can be collected using Liquid Biopsies involving Circulating Tumour Cells and Circulating Free DNA within the Blood

# Reverse Translation

### Resistance to EGFR Inhibitors

- Whilst EGFR Inhibitors showed initially effectiveness in Px with EGFR +ve Mutations in Lung Adenocarcinoma, over time, Resistance to the EGFR Inhibitors developed, reducing the efficacy of the Therapy
- Following the Development of Resistance within these Px, biopsies of the Rx-Resistant Tumour can be taken and analysed to compare the Genetic Profiles of the Rx Sensitive and Rx Resistant Tumours to identify mutations that give rise to the Immunity
- It was shown that in around 60% of Cases for EGFR+ve Rx-Resistant Lung Adenocarcinoma, there was an additional Mutation in EGFR (T790M) that prevented Rx from Inhibiting EGFR, giving rise to resistance
- This led to the development of EGFR-mutation specific EGFR inhibitors which had fewer on target side effects due to inhibition of Wild-Type EGFR in normal cells and were active against the EGFR Mutation that gave rise to Rx Resistance - Osimertinib

![Untitled](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Untitled%2013.png)

### Osimertinib Response in T790M-Positive NSCLC (Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma)

- In Px who had been given EGFR TKIs but subsequently developed resistance due to the acquisition of the T790M Mutation in EGFR, Osimertinib showed to produce reductions in the size of the tumour and improved survival, despite this initial resistance

# Precision Thoracic Oncology

### Non-Squamous NSCLC, Targets and Therapy

- Therefore, by identifying mutations that give rise to Rx resistance in Px who were previously responsive to therapies, this allows for the development of Additional Drugs via Reverse Translation that produce the same effects on Intracellular Signalling but are not inhibited by the mutation that previously led to Rx resistance
- Genome Analysis has allowed for the subclassification of Non-Squamous NSCLCs based on the specific driver mutations that are responsible for their unregulated proliferation, which can be used to develop driver mutation-specific Rx which are used specifically in Px who have been identified to have the driver mutation in order to maximise efficacy
- Licensed treatments for:
1. EGFR
2. ALK
3. ROS1
4. BRAF
5. NTRK
6. MET
7. RET

# ALK Rearrangements in NSCLC

- ALK Chromosomal rearrangements in NSCLC were first described in 2007 and occur in 3–5% of NSCLC
- EML4 is the most common fusion gene in NSCLC, allowing tumoral expression of the oncogenic fusion protein EML4-ALK1
- Other rarer, non-EML4, fusion partners for ALK have also been described in NSCLC including KIF5B and TFG
- ALK rearrangements in NSCLC are more common in:
1. Tumours with adenocarcinoma histology
2. Tumors without other known oncogenic drivers (i.e. EGFR and KRAS wild type)
3. Never or light smokers
- These are similar characteristics to those with Lung Adenocarcinoma who are EGFR+ve

# Crizotinib - ‘Selective’ MET/ALK Inhibitor

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 18.12.29.png](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_18.12.29.png)

### Best % Change From Baseline In Target Lesions

- It has been shown that when Crizotinib (MET/ALK Inhibitor) was given to Px with ALK Translocation +ve Px with Lung Cancers, it produced clinical benefits in almost all Px, which persisted for around 10 months

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 18.14.33.png](%5B038%5D%20Personalised%20Oncology%20590dc6f155a4462b825fab8cd1b6a98e/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_18.14.33.png)

### Key Points

- Crizotinib was well tolerated with rapid, dramatic and durable/long lasting responses and prolonged PFS in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC:
- ORR 61%, median duration of response 48 weeks
- Median PFS 10 months
- Demonstrates that in a molecular-selected population with a very rare cancer, a small study can give meaningful efficacy read-out which can allow for rapid licenses of Target Oncological Therapies
- This study lead to FDA accelerated approval in Aug 2011

### Key Results - Summary of Tumour Responses with Crizotinib in Px With Advanced ROS1 + NSCLC

- Critzotinib was also shown to be effective in a much smaller subset of Px who had a ROS1 Fusion Gene, producing significant clinical effects in a wide range of ages with ROS1+ NSCLC

# Philadephia Chromosome in CML

- When a Translocation Mutation occurs between Chromosome 9 and Chromosome 22 where the Break Site occurs part way along the Abl gene on Chromosome 9 and part way along the Bcr gene in Chromosome 22, this led to the production of a Shortened Chromosome 22 (Philadelphia Chromosome) that contained a Fusion Bcr-Abl gene either side of the Fusion Site
- The Presence of a Fusion Bcr-Abl gene is pathognomonic of CML
- Fusion Genes are very effective targets for Targeted Cancer Therapy as they are genes that are specifically found within Malignant Cells but not in healthy cells, allowing Drugs to affect Cancerous Cells but not Healthy Cells

# Precision Oncology

- Therefore, Precision Oncology involves Biopsies of Px Tumours to identify the Cancer Genome and identify Specific Driver Mutations
- Identification of Biomarkers within Tumours can then be used to select Drugs against specific Driver Mutations/Genetic Mutations within the Tumour that are most likely to be the most efficacious
- Following commensal of Rx, it is important to Regularly Monitor the Px with PET Scanning, Repeat Biopsy and Circulating Tumour cells to identify whether Rx is working or not.
- If the Rx stops working as the Tumour has developed Resistance, Biopsies and Circulating Tumour Cells can be analysed to identify New Mutations in the Cancer Genome that might be responsible for this resistance so that new drugs can be selected that will not be affected by this additional mutation and still produce clinical effects

# The Future

- The Process of Identifying new drug targets due to characteristic driver mutations within the tumour and the development of Target Therapies is an ongoing process that is being continuously refined
- Development of clinical pathways to incorporate novel technologies of Tumour Genetic Sequencing and Molecular Characterisation (GLH in UK) into standard clinical care (not just in specialist centres) so that a wider range of Px can be effectively monitored and receive Targeted Cancer Therapies
- Possibility of personalised immunotherapy and cell therapies
- Early detection of cancers and their recurrence through molecular surveillance and the identification of Cancer Specific Molecular Markers
- Possibility of personalised preventative strategies
