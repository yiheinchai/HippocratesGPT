# Male Vs Female Pelvis

### Female

- Preauricular Sulcus is found between the Greater Sciatic Notch inferiorly and the Auricular Surface of the Ilium superiorly → This is not found in men

- On the Medial Aspect of the Inferior Pubic Ramus/Ischiopubic, there are markings/tubercles for the Crura of the Penis that are not present on the Female Pelvis
- Relative Size of Acetabular Diameter from Acetabulum to Pubic Symphysis is larger in women than men
- Greater Sciatic Notch is narrow and U Shaped in Males but wider and V Shaped in Women

### Pelvic X-Ray

- Roof of the Acetabulum is the region of the Hip Joint that transmits the majority of the body weight at the Hip Joint, meaning it is often more radioopaque than the remainder of the Acetabulum
- In the Healthy Spaces, the Joint Spaces in the Hip and Sacroiliac Joints should be visible

### Ligaments of the Pelvis and Sacrum

- Dorsal Sacroiliac Ligament connects the Posterior Superior Iliac Spine and the Inner Aspect of the Iliac Crest to the Ridge of the Sacrum
- Sacrospinous Ligament = Inferior Border of Greater Sciatic Foramen and Superior Border of Lesser Sciatic Foramen
- Suprtuberous Ligament = Inferior Border  and Medial Border of Lesser Sciatic Foramen

- Iliolumbar Ligament attaches to L5 and the Ilium
- The Pectineal Ligament is the most posterior and lateral expansion of the Lacunal Ligament, running along the Pectineal Line inferior to the Subinguinal Space
- The Lateral Margin of the Lacunal Ligament form the Medial Boundary of the Femoral Canal
- The Lacunar Ligament is formed from the Fibres of the Inguinal Ligament that run posteriorly and horizontally to become continuous with the Pectineal Line

# Pelvic Nerves

- SNS Nerves to the pelvis arise from the Sympathetic Trunk at levels T5 to L2 and T12-L2 (Lumbar Splanchnic Nerves)
- These synapse in the Superior and Inferiro Hypogastric and Pelvic Sympahtetic Ganglia (usually near the aorta at the level of S2)
- The Right and Left Hypogastric Nerves connect the Addomnal Aortic Plexus superiorly with the Superior Hypogastric Plexus inferiorly

# Male Pelvic Viscera

- The Vas Deferens runs medially along the Lateral Wall of the Pelvic Cavity, lateral to the Bladder
- As the Vas Deferens runs medially, it crosses and runs over the anterior surface of the Ureter

![18b4b0bf-717a-4d3d-a228-c13d71671d8e.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Pelvic%20Anatomy%20Lab%20833ae95b7fe942b49218bd9c0d40578e/18b4b0bf-717a-4d3d-a228-c13d71671d8e.jpg)

- The Ureter enters the Inferolateral aspect of Posterior Surface of the Bladder
- The Vas Deferens drains into the Urethra just superior to where the Seminal Vesicles are found and these two structures merge distally near the Bladder Neck to form the Ejaculatory Duct

- The Vaginal Canal is thrown into Rugae
