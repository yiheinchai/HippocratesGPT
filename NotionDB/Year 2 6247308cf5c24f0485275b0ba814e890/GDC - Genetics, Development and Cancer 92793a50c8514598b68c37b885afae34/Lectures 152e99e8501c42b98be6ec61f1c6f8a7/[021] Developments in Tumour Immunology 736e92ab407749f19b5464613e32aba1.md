# [021] Developments in Tumour Immunology

# Immunosurveilance Hypothesis

- Sir Macfarlane Burnet (1957): “It is by no means inconceivable
that small accumulations to tumour cells may develop and
because of their possession of new antigenic potentialities
provoke an effective immunological reaction with regression of
tumour and no clinical hint of its existence.”
- This led to the idea that the Immune System is able to recognise tumour cells via the expression of non-self Cancerous Ag (arise due to mutations to genes encoding Ag) and destroy them
- The Immune System however, is very tightly regulated to prevent against autoimmunity and immunodeficiency from excessive and insufficient immune responses
- Tumours take advantage of immmune regulatory mechanisms to downregulate the immune response against tumour cells to allow these cells to avoid immune destruction

# Immune System

- Innate: involves proteins (chemokines and cytokines) and cells.
- The Innate Immune System is considered to be first line of defence and produces a rapid response.
- Adaptive: mediated by B and T cells and is highly specific and
capable of generating an antigen-specific response alongside immunological memory.
- APCs like Dendritic Cells and NK Cells provide a link between the Innate and Adaptive Immune Systems via Antigen Presentation to activate the Adaptive Immune Response
- Induction of the Adaptive Immune Response requires presentation by cells of innate immune system to activate CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells.

### Importance of T Cells

- There is a strong correlation between T cell presence/infiltration in tumours and patient survival.

# Cancer Immune Editing

- Normal cells develop a series of mutations and transform into
tumour cells.
- These mutated genes will synthesise mutated proteins that can be expressed on the cell surface where they act as non-self Ag and can be detected by the Immune System.
- Elimination phase: immune system recognise non-self mutated Ag, stimulating an immune response against the tumour cell which destroys tumour cells to prevent them from replicating to form a tumour
- Due to subsequent accumulation of mutations within Genetically Unstable Cells, Cancerous Ag on the surface of the Tumour Cell can constantly be changing so that they are no longer detected by the immune system, causing the effectiveness of the immune response against the tumour cell to decrease
- Equilibrium phase: immune cells try and shut down tumour growth via immune destruction of the tumour cell, but some tumour cells acquire mutations which enable them to resist/avoid immune desturction, causing no net loss in the number of cancerous cells.
- Most patients present at equilibrium stage.
- Escape phase: when tumour acquires significant mutations that allows them to avoid immune destruction and proliferate at a rate greater than that which they can be destroyed by the Immune System, causing net tumour cell proliferation and hence, tumour growth
- This escape phase can occur due to upregulation/recruitment of Immunosuppressive Cells like Tregs by Tumour Cells to suppress the Immune Response, secretion of Immunosuppressive Factors like TGF-β or IL-6, reduced Cancerous Ag Presentation (e.g due to MHC Class II Mutations which prevents their presentation or recognition by immune cells), upregulation of Anti-Apoptotic Factors or expression of Membrane Bound T Cell Inhibitors

# T Cells

### Activation of Naive T Cells

- Signal 1: antigen presentation (MHC) to T cell receptor.
- Just this signal without signal 2/coactivation leaves the T cell in an anergic state.
- Signal 2: Co-stimulatory signal from CD80/86 to CD28 (T cell).
- This activates T cell.
- Signal 2 Usually involves multiple combinations of signal pairs, involving Positive/Stimulatory and Negative/Inhibitory Signals, with the net polarity of this signal determining whether the T Cell is activated or suppressed following Ag Recognition and Stimulation

### T Cell Targets For Immunoregulatory Antibody Therapy

- Due to the importance of Costimulatory or Coinhibitory Membrane Receptors in the regulation of the T Cell Response, mAb can be used to Agonise or Antagonise these receptors to augment the T Cell Response
- For Cancer Immunotherapy, this usually involves stimulating Costimulatory and Inhibiting Coinhibitory Receptors so that the Net Polarity of Signal 2 is more positive, increasing T Cell activation and hence, the magnitude of the T Cell Response that is directed against the Cancerous Cell

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 14.18.10.png](%5B021%5D%20Developments%20in%20Tumour%20Immunology%20736e92ab407749f19b5464613e32aba1/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_14.18.10.png)

### CTLA-4

- When T cell receptor engages with antigen presenting cell (Signal 1), CD28 also engages/binds with CD80/86 AKA B7.1/B7.2 (Signal 2).
- Both these signals provide a +ve signal to activate T cell.
- CTLA-4 is an coinhibitory molecule and regulates immune response.
- It is normally present in vesicles within T cells which are constantly trafficking between the Cytoplasm and the Cell Membrane to tightly regulate CTLA-4 Expression.
- When CTLA-4 Expressing Vesicles reach and fuse with the cell membrane, CTLA-4 is expresssed on the cell surface and binds to same co-receptors that CD28 does (binds to CD80/86) at a higher affinity than CD28.
- Therefore, CTLA-4 displaces CD28, which inhibits the stimulatory signal 2, so T cell cannot be activated.
- Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies bind to CTLA-4 to prevent it from binding to CD80/86. This means that CD28 is now able to bind to CD80/86 so T cell can get the positive signal 2 again.
- When a Px is given anti-CTLA-4 mAB, there are more CD8+, CD4+ and Foxp3 cells expressed and hence, there is a greater T Cell Response against the tumour cells.

### The Immune System is Hijacked by Tumour Microenvironment

- Gvax (GMCSF-Secreting Cellular Vaccine) is a source of Tumour Ag and mediates the recruitment of APCs and T Cell Priming which is ineffective when used in isolation but when given with Anti-CTLA-4 mAB, it alters the tumour microenvironment which indicates an improved T Cell Response against the Malignant Cells
- Treg cells are CD4+ T Cells express Foxp3 (transcription factor) which acts to inhibit T Cell Activity and hence, their presence within tumours are positive correlated with worse prognosis.
- Untreated tumour (Only given Vaccine): very few T cells are present in the Tumour, with most of these tumours being CD4+ T Cells (The Majority of which are Treg Cells)
- This means that there is an excess of regulatory response (regulatory response > effector response).
- Treated tumour: giving anti-CTLA-4 drug and GVax causes a huge
effector response (effector response > regulatory response) due to greater T Cell Infiltrate into the Tumour, containing a greater proportion of CD8+ Cells and fewer Treg Cells.

# Human Treatment

- Ipilimumab and Tremelimumab: Anti-CTLA-4 drug (Checkpoint Inhibitor) used in the Rx of Melanoma
- CD4+ T cells/Foxp3 Treg ratio (Magnitude of T Cell Immune Response) directly correlates with degree of tumour necrosis and hence, degree of clinical response in melanoma patients after Px is given Ipilumimab.
- Ipilumimab was 1st therapy for unresectable or metastatic melanoma to improve outcomes in a phase III trial.
- Patients that survive past 3 years are effectively cured of their cancer and Ipilimumab increases survival rate of melanoma over a short and long duration.

### PD-1 (Programmed Cell Death Protein 1)

- PD-1 controls T cell activity at tumour site and hence, is a key checkpoint in the tumour microenvironment.
- Interaction between activated T cells and tumour cell in the immune synapse.
- PD-1 is expressed in T cells, and is upregulated in activated T cells.
- PD-1 on T Cells binds to PD-L1 which is expressed by tumour cells (and stromal cells and APCs) and upregulated in response to IFN-γ released by activated T Cells and when this occurs, the T Cell Response is inhibited
- T cell receptor engages with MHC on tumour cell. When there is
no interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1/PD-L2, T cell destroys
tumour cell.
- When PD-1 interacts with PD-L1/PD-L2, T cells is prevented from destroying tumour cell.
- Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies (E.g Nivolumab) can be used to prevent T Cell Response Inhibition by PD-1 Signalling, allowing T cells to target the tumour cell and destroy it.

### Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1

- Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1 are more effective when given together than individually as they act synergistically to enhance the efficacy of each other.
- Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1 combination therapy produced clinical responses in > 80% of patients when there is no alternative therapy.

# Challenges in Immune-Oncology

- As Regulation of the Immune Response is present to prevent Autoimmunity and Immunodeficiency, Side Effects associated with Immunotherapy in Oncology are usually related to Autoimmunity by stimulating the T Cell Response Vs Tumour Cells, they heighten the immune response in general, which can lead to autoimmunity
- Common Side Effects = GI (Collitis and Diarrhoea) and Skin (Rash, Pruritis and Vitiligo) are seen in around 30% of Px but they are clinically manageable and hence, still commonly used and well tolerated by Px
- Endocrine Effects (E.g Thyroiditis and Hypophysitis) and Neuropathic and Haematopoetic Effects can also be seen
- Rationalised Combination Therapies - It can often be difficult to identify which costimulatory/coinhibitory targets on Tumour/Immune Cells should be targetted to produce a therapeutic response with maximum efficacy on the T Cell Response vs Malignant Cells but with minimal side effects

### Mapping the Immune Landscape of Human Cancers via Progression and Therapy

- Different Types of Cancers contain different cellular profiles within their Tumour Microenvironment
- Therefore, as different immune cells express different costimulatory/coinhibitory molecules in different amounts, identification of the predominant tumour cells within the Microenvironment can allow for selective mAb against specific costimulatory/coinhibitory targets to be selected to allow for maximum Rx efficacy

### How Do T Cells Recognise Tumours?

- Tumour associated antigens (TAAs): These are mutated proteins expressed by cancerous cells that are solely presented on the cell surface/upregulated in cancerous cells and act as non-self Ag to trigger an immune responses - These are potential targets for therapeutic vaccination to produce immunological memory against the cancer Ag before the cancer occurs.
- There are some Tumour Associated Antigens that can be expressed in healthy tissue or during certain stages of embryonic development and therefore, these cannot be used as Ag to stimulate an immune response (E.g Target of Cancer Vaccine) as they can stimulate autoimmunity where the Ag is expressed normally
- Many Tumour-Associated Ag are not expressed in Healthy Ag but are very similar in structure to Self Ag therefore, there can be the risk of Autoimmunity occurring during a T Cell Response against cells expressing a Tumour Specific Ag due to Molecular Mimicry

# Prediction and Detection Neo-Antigenic Peptides in Cancer

- As Tumour cells are genetically unstable, they can generate spontaneous somatic mutations which can produce mutated proteins that can eventually behave as Ag (Tumour Neo-Antigens, which can be directly recognsied by specific T Cells to produce focused immune responses vs Cancerous Cells
- Mutations are the enabling/driving force behind cancer and Malignant Transformation and can be found within Tumour Cells Frequently, Regularly or Occasionally (3 Different Groupings based on Neoantigen Repertoire)
- Those Cancers (E.g Epithelial) that arise due to exposure to external mutagens/carcinogens are commonly found within the Frequently Mutated Group of Cells with a Large Neoantigen Repertoire whilst Haematological Tumours usually have a very low Neoantigen Repertoire as their growth is usually Oncogene Driven, with a small number of mutations being enough to drive unregulated cell proliferation
- We can detect the Neoantigen Repertoire and hence, the number of Somatic Mutations within a tumour cell by:
1. Sequence tumours and find coding mutations within the exome.
2. Model binding as nonamers to patient’s HLA to see whether mutated proteins can be presented by HLA and hence, act as Neoantigens.
3. Choose high affinity binding neo-epitopes within the Antigen that are most efficacious at stimulating an immune response.
4. Detection of T Cells with high affinity to the Neoantigen using fluorescent multimers.

### Association Between Neoantigen Burden and Immune Activation

- The magnitude of Neo-antigenic burden correlates with the degree of immune activation seen at the tumour site.

### From Detection To Intervention - Neoantigen-Based Cancer Vaccines

- In Human Melanoma, there is a negative correlation between the number of somatic mutations found within the Cancer cell and the efficacy of Anti-CTLA-4 and hence, Px survival
- Neo-antigen responding T cells (NARTs) undergo clonal expansion and are found in greater number in melanoma patients who are responding to anti-CTLA-4.
- NARTs undergo cloncal expansion and are found in greater number in tumours in response to PD-1 blockage, which is correlating with improved tumour control.
- NARTs can be induced by Neoantigen-Based Cancer Vaccines which are personalised cancer vaccines where Neoantigens likely to be expressed in a certain cancer type and a vaccine can be formulated with those Neoantigens present to stimulate immunological memory against the Neoantigens to allow for more rapidly tumour destruction/regulation if that specific cancer expressing the Neoantigen forms
- NARTs can be used in T Cell based therapies as once Tumour Specific Neoantigens are identified, T Cells specific against that Neoantigen can be identified and isolated
- In Vitro, the NARTs Specific against the Neoantigen can be proliferated and then reintroduced to the Px to increase the magnitude of the immune response against the tumour to provide better tumour control

# Summary

- Immune system is tightly regulated.
- There are different mechanisms of regulation including regulatory cells and immune-modulatory receptors (+ and -).
- Tumours hijack regulation and establish an intra-tumoural balance
that favours tumour growth and immune escape.
- Immune-modulatory mabs alter this balance and promote tumour destruction and control in mice and man.
- Cancer mutations promote T cell priming and correlate with
response to checkpoint blockade (basis for new cancer vaccines).
- Immunotherapy is effective at cancer control.
