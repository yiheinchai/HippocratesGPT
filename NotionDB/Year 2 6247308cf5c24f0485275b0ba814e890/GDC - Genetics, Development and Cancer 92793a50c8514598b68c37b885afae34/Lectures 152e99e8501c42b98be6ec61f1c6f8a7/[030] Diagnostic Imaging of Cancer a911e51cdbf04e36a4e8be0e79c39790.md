# [030] Diagnostic Imaging of Cancer

# Why is Imaging Important

- Screening for early diagnosis.
- Staging and location: guides surgeons on surgical plan and whether tumour can be safely resected with wide margins or not and therapy planning (smaller tumours are usually surgically resected whereas larger tumours are commonly Rx via Chemotherapy).
- Therapeutic response and recurrence: patients followed longitudinally to look at whether surgery/therapy has been effective in Rx the Cancer by looking to see if cancer is shrinking over time and to check for reoccurance of cancer.
- Ultrasound is predominantly for Neonatal and Vascular Imaging as Sound Waves are highly attenuated by bone and hence, provide poor visualisation of regions with high density such as bones
- MRI provides the highest resolution of Tumour Imaging, has good soft-tissue contrast but it is very expensive and takes a long time to produce a comprehensive scan
- CT is used more frequently than MRI in clinics as it can form an image rapidly and is cheap but it provides poor tissue contrast

# X-Ray

### Generation

- Wilhelm Rontgen (1895)

### Chest X Ray (CXR)

- X-Rays are a form of Ionising Radiation but due to their high energy/low wavelength, they can penetrate the body but are also absorbed to allow X-Rays to be used to visualise internal structures
- Px is placed in front of an X-Ray Source and as the X-Ray passes through the Px, it interacts with tissue (is attentuated or transmitted through structures) and is detected by an X-Ray Detector placed behind the Px

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 22.37.29.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_22.37.29.png)

- Within an X-Ray Tube, A High Voltage Current is supplied to the Cathode, to produce a beam of electrons that strikes a Tungsten Target (Anode) to make them emit X-Rays
- This can produce 2 forms of X-Rays:
1. Bremsstrahlung X-Rays (80% of X-Rays Produced) - This is when electrons pass through the atom and are slowed and deflected towards the Nucleus or when passing just next to atoms, are slowed deflected away from the Atom due to electrostatic repulsion between the Electron Beam and the Electron Shells of the Atom (Braking)
- Slowing the Electrons causes the Electrons to release energy in the form of X-Rays
1. Characteristic Radiation (20% of X-Rays Produced) - This is when an electron from the Electron Beam collides with and displaces a Tungsten Electron from its shell, causing an Electron from a Higher Energy Level to drop down to replace the Ejected Electron which causes it to emit an X-Ray
- The Contrast produced by the X-Ray can be altered by changing the Voltage within the X-Ray Tube, which alters the Velocity of the Electrons that are hitting the Tungsten Target or by changing the Filter within the X-Ray Tube to only allow X-Rays of a specific wavelength/energy to be emitted from the X-Ray Tube

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 22.44.45.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_22.44.45.png)

### Chest X-Ray

- Px is Placed in front of an X-Ray Detector and is illuminated using a Short Low Energy X-Ray Pulse from a source located behind the Px
- White: bone are dense contain Ca²⁺, which absorbs/attenuates X rays. Therefore, fewer X rays reaching detector, causing these structures to appear radioopaque/white.
- Black: soft tissue (e.g. lungs) poorly attenuate X-Rays, meaning more X-Rays reach the detector, causing these tissues to appear black.
- Tumours within Soft Tissue appear as Radioopaque Nodules (Quite Circular but non-uniform in shape), sometimes surrounded by Hazy/Fluffy Radioopaque material
- Solitary Nodules tend to be from a Primary Cancer whereas Multiple Nodules tend to indicate Metastatic Cancer (Secondary Cancer)

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.16.17.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.16.17.png)

### X-Ray Attenuation - Hounsfield Units (HU)

- Hounsfield Units provide a relative comparison of x-ray attenuation of a unit volume of tissue to an equal volume of water.
- Water is used because it is in abundance in the body and has a uniform density.
- Water is assigned an arbitrary HU value of 0.
- Tissue denser than water are given positive HU numbers.
- Tissue with less density than water are assigned negative HU numbers

### Mammogram

- Low energy X rays to screen and diagnose breast cancer.
- Here, the X-Ray Source is placed above the Breast and the X-Ray Film Plate is placed below the breast
- UK breast screening women aged 50-73 years old every 3 years.
- Benign Cysts tend to have a defined circular/oval shape and are fluid-filled, causing it to appear to have radioopaque borders/margins with a less radioopaque Core
- However, Cancer of the Breast tend to produce non-uniform circular nodules that are uniformly densely radioopaque, surrounded by diffuse radioopaque areas

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.16.42.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.16.42.png)

### Pros of Mammogram Screening

- 1.94 million women screening (2011-12) (73% invited).
- 15,749 of these women had detectable cancer (8.1 cases/1,000 women).
- 5.7 breast cancer deaths prevented per 1,000 women screened for 20 years.
- This means that Mammograms are very useful at screening process to allow for Early Diagnosis of Breast Cancer to allow for early Rx to produce a very good prognosis (Significant Mortality Reduction)

### Cons of Mammogram Screening

1. Over-diagnosis can affect 1 in 5 of women screened in UK.
- False +ve occur in up to 50% of cases (Can be caused by Calcification of Mammary Glands).
- False -ve occur in 20% of cases (E.g Some Women can have very dense breast tissue that can hide/obscure Cancer Nodules).
1. As X-Rays use Ionising Radiation, they can only be given a certain amount of times a year to reduce the risk of Radiation-Induced Cellular Mutations occuring which can lead to Cancer. However, Radiation dose in Regular Mammogram Screening for Breast Cancer causes 3-6 extra breast cancers per 10,000 women who have regular 3 yearly breast screening (47-73 years old).

### Screening Principles

- NHS: identify apparent healthy people who may be at an ↑ risk of a disease or condition.
1. Must be used to Dx Important health problem.
2. Condition must be Recognisable at an early stage.
3. Treatment outcome must be more effective/have a better outcome at an early stage.
4. Suitable and acceptable screening test exists.
5. The chance of harm via screening is less than chance of benefit.
6. Cost must be balanced against benefit in the screening programme.

# Computerised Tomography (CT)

- This uses an X-Ray Tube that is placed within a Rotatory Helical/Cylindrical Scanner that surrounds the Px who is lying Supine, with an X-Ray Detector placed on the other side of the Rotating Cylinder
- This X-Ray Tube produces a fan shaped beam and using a Helical Scan (Where Cylindrical Scanner rotates as the Px moves through the Scanner) to take multiple images of the Px from 360°, which are combined to produce a 3D image of the Px
- As the CT Scan is comprised of multiple separate images that are combined to form a single Scan, the 3D Image Produced is of a much greater resolution than that seen from a Standard X-Ray
- Like In X-Ray, Low → High Attentuation (Many → Few X-Rays reaching the Detector) causes structures to Appear White (Bone) → Grey (Soft Tissue and Fluid) → Black (Air-Filled Spaces like Lungs)
- However, CT Images provide poor Soft-Tissue Contrast, making it difficult to distinguish between different types of Soft Tissue based on composition
- Due to the 3D Image produced by CT Scans, they can produce Images in 3 Planes to allow for better localisation of masses and determination of their size within the body than seen in X-Ray (allows for management/surgical plan to be more effectively formulated):
1. Transaxial
2. Sagittal
3. Coronal

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.18.20.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.18.20.png)

### Tumour Detection

- CT Scans are quite effective for visualising Lung Cancers as due to the lungs being air filled whilst Tumours are solid masses, these structures attentuate X-Rays to significantly different extents, meaning that there is a high degree of natural contrast seen without Contrast
- Like in X-Rays, Tumours can be identified on CTs as they tend to have irregularly shaped borders and tend to be more dense than surrounding soft tissue
- However, the poor soft tissue contrast seen in CTs (due to small differences in X-Ray attentuation between Tumours and Soft Tissue) means it can be quite difficult to identify tumours in solid soft tissue structures (E.g Bowel and Abdominal Viscera)
- Contrast agents (barium and iodine) can be given to the Px improve soft tissue contrast to allow for better discrimination between tumours and healthy tissue.
- Barium is very radioopaque can be given orally to increase the attentuation of the GI Tract Lumen to allow for the GI Tract and its morphology to be better visualised (Can be used to visualise obstructions of the GI Tract which can indicate the presence of GI Tumours that are growing into the GI Tract lumen)
- Iodine is administered IV and as it is radioopaque, it can be visualised within arterioles and capillaries supplying viscera/soft tissue and tumours (notably the Liver)
- Due to the High Vascularity of Tumours, Iodine causes the margins/borders of the Tumours, to become extremely radioopaque (more so than the surrounding Soft Tissue that is less well vascularised and hence, not as radioopaque) during the Arterial Phase
- During the Venous Phase, Iodine begins to enter the mass of the Tumour and be retained here, causing the Tumour Mass to become more radioopaque whilst the Iodine in the vasculature of the surrounding soft tissue is rapidly drained by Veins, causing the surrounding tissue to become more radiotranslucent
- This allows for tumour vascularisation/perfusion and tumour margins to be accurately determined

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.18.58.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.18.58.png)

### Therapy Response

- Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST): size and
number of tumours in body.
- Complete response: disappearance of all lesions after therapy.
- Partial response: 30% ↓ in size and number of lesions after therapy.
- Progressive disease: 20% ↑ in size and number of lesions after therapy.
- Stable disease: small changes that do not meet above criteria.
- [Top image] Lung metastases: partial response.
- [Bottom image] Liver metastases: Stable disease (nothing has changed).
- However, not all Rx for Cancer cause Tumours to shrink but rather, cause Tumour Necrosis so therefore, Contrast Agents are used to give further information for where RECIST may suggest a Progressive/Stable Disease despite the Rx producing a Therapeutic Response
- Here, Reduction in Iodine Uptake Pre and Post-Rx (E.g Changes in Radioopacity of the Tumour so tumour appears less radioopaque after Rx) indicates that Rx has caused Reduced Vascularisation of the Tumour (causing Tumour Necrosis) and hence, is producing Therapeutic Effects for Rx the Cancer

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.19.51.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.19.51.png)

### Pros of CT

- Superior to conventional X rays, higher contrast resolution and
anatomic structures are not superimposed on one another (E.g no Rib Shadowing), allowing for better identification of diffuse nodules.
- Currently most reproducible method to assess treatment response
in cancer patients.
- Can be used for surgical planning as it allows for more accurate size determination and localisation of tumours from the 3D Image as well as assessing their vascularity via Contrast Agents
- Can be used with pace makers or if any metal in body unlike MRIs.
- Fast: actual scans take seconds not minutes.

### Cons of CT

- Radiation exposure: no more than 2 scans per years/not suitable if
pregnant.
- Side effects/reaction to contrast media (E.g Px can be allergic to iodine and hence, cannot have Contrast CTs).
- Poor Soft Tissue Contrast which makes it difficult to visualise tissues within Soft Tissue Structures (E.g Viscera like the Liver) → Misdiagnosis
- Expensive

# Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

- H Nuclei (Protons) within Water are placed in a large magnetic field within an MRI Scanner, causing the spin of the protons to line up and spin at the Lamour Frequency
- Within an MRI there is a radio frequency emitter and detected found at 90° to the plane in which the Protons are lined up (In the Transverse Plane) and it emits a radio frequency pulse at the Lamour Frequency which excites the protons so that instead of spinning around the z plane, they now spin in the X and Y planes
- When the Radiofrequency pulse is terminated, protons resume to their normal spin around the z axis
- Therefore, before the radio frequency inpulse, there was net magnetisation in the z direction/sagittal plane but after the application of the Radiofrequency field, the net magntitisation in in the XY (Transverse) plane, the magnitude of which can be recorded and analysed to produce an image
- As different organs contain different quantities of water, held in different forms in different tissues, this oscillation between net magnitisation in the z and then xy planes occurs at a different rate in different tissues and hence, can be used to provide inherent contrast of tissues dependent on their water content

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.21.47.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.21.47.png)

# Contrast Mechanisms

### T1 Relaxation

- For T1 Weighted Imaging, the Detector is in the XY Plane so when the net magnetisation/spin of the protons changes from the Z to the XY Plane, a signal is produced and recorded
- Structures that are fatty/bone with lots of structure, water molecules will dephase and switch their net magnetisation from the z axis to the XY plane and then rapidly recover to change their net magnetisation back to the z direction, having a short recovery time
- Structures that contain a large amount of water spin in the XY Plane for a long period of time and recover/shift their net magnetisation to the z plane very slowly, having a very long recovery time
- Faster recovery/repetition time between magnetism oscillations gives a stronger signal (white) in the XY Plane when the protons revert their net spin/magnetisation back to the Z Plane whereas slower repetition time between oscillations gives a weak signal (black) in the XY Plane.
- Therefore, Fat = White, Water is Dark and other soft-tissue structures are grey

### T2 Relaxation

- T2 Relaxation looks at how the net direction of magnetisation changes within the XY Plane
- When Nuclei are excited, there is divergence of the net magnetisation direction within the XY Plane as different nuclei are dephasing at different rates
- Following the initial 90° pulse and the dephasing/divergence of the spin/net magnetisation within the XY Plane, a 180° pulse is applied to the nuclei to realign them
- Due to the slower repetition time of Nuclei within water rich substances (like Blood and CSF) compaired to less water rich substances like fat, at any moment of time, nuclei within Blood and CSF have dephased less than those in Fat and hence, have more energy
- This means that when the 180° pulse is applied, the net energy within nuclei that have not dephased significantly (Blood and CSF) is far greater than that within nuclei that have more significantly dephased (E.g Fat), causing Blood and CSF to produce a stronger signal and appear white whereas Fat produces a weaker signal and appears dark

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.30.10.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.30.10.png)

# MRI Tumour Detection

- For Tumours, T1 Weighted Imaging delineates tumour anatomy better to allow for accurate localisation of the tumour and its margins
- For Tumours, T2 Weighting can be used to indicate areas of necrosis (appear dark on T2 Weighted Imaging) and oedema (more radioopaque diffuse areas surrounding the tumour) which can be used analyse the pathology of the tumour
- As Cancers are usually more cellular dense than surrounding tissues, there is greater proton dephasing within these structures, causing decreased Signals in T2 Images (appear darker than surrounding tumour)
- For Oedematous and Vascular Tumours (E.g Haemangioma or Cerebral Tumours), the presence of oedema or blood means their water content increses and produces a stronger signal in a T2 Image (appears whiter than surrounding structures)

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.30.53.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.30.53.png)

### MRI Contrast Agents

- Gadolinium - Contrast affecting T1 to allow for better determination of tumour anatomy and location
- Gadolinium is paramagnetic and causes surrounding water to dephase more rapidly to the z axis, causing signals by these structures to be enhanced (white signals appear whiter so that they can be more clearly distinguished from surrounding darker tissue)
- As tumour vasculature is very porous, there is leakage of Gadolinium into the Interstitial Fluid of the Tumour which is not seen in the surrounding healthy tissue, causing Gadolinium to persist within the tumour whilst it is removed from the surrounding tissue, causing the tumour to appear brighter than the surrounding tissue on MRI
- Iron Oxide (Fe₃O₄ surrounded by a Biocompatible Coating) - Contrasting affecting T2 to allow for better determination of tumour pathology and effect on surrounding tissue (Oedema and Necrosis)
- Iron Oxide also causes rapid dephasing of surrounding water, which reduces the signal released by structures to make them appear darker
- Metastases tend to have similar T2 Values and hence, appear very similar in colour to surrounding tissue as they arise from a different tissue and therefore, do not stimulate potent angiogenesis in the region of the tissue surrounding the metastasis
- When Iron Oxide is injected, Kupffer Cells in the Macrophage phagocytose Iron Oxide, causing Iron Oxide to be retained within the Liver, causing uniform darkening of the liver by reducing the signal output from the Liver
- As Tumours do not express Kupffer Cells, Iron Oxide persists for a shorter duration of time within the tumour cells in comparison to the surrounding Liver Parenchyma, causing the Tumour Signal to slowly increase in intensity/recover over time, making it appear brighter than the surrounding Liver
- Due to enhancements in the resolution that can now be provided by MRI, Iron Oxide Contrasts are no longer used in clinic

### MRI - Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE)

- Calculates MRI Perfusion by evalulating the degree at which the T1 Signal is shortened over time following a Gadolinium Contrast Bolus (Ktrans)
- Ktrans is calculated by measuring the accumulation of Gadolinium in the Extravascular-Extracellular Space before it is cleared from the circulation via Lymph
- This is a good method to analyse cerebral tumours as usually the BBB Prevents Gadolinium from entering the Brain however, if a Tumour occurs near the BBB, it can cause nearby regions of the BBB to break down (non-uniform BBB Degeneration), allowing Gadolinium to enter the brain across the BBB at different rates (depending on the degree of BBB damage seen) and hence, produce different degrees of enhancement of signals produced by the Brain
- Therefore, if images are taken over time following a Gadolinium Bolus, the degree of T1 Repetition Time Shortening seen in various regions of the Brain can be used to determine uptake rates of Gadolinium in different regions of the Brain to allow for effective localisation of the tumour by determining areas of high vascularity (and hence, high delivery of Gadolinium)

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.31.22.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.31.22.png)

### MRI - Perfusion Imaging

- Arterial spin labelling (ASL):
- This is used to visualise blood that is entering the plane of Imaging from another region of the Body (Usually used to visualise the Brain)
- A Control Image is taken to visualise the anatomy of the Brain and then blood within the Cerebral Vascularity (Mainly within the Internal Carotid Arteries) is labelled by using a 180° pulse
- When the protons within the Blood enter the Brain, they dephase more rapidly to make blood appear darker than it was previously
- Subtraction is then used where the image produced when the Blood is Labelled is taken away from the Control so only the blood can be visualised to allow for a perfusion map of the Brain to be determined, which can be used to analyse Tumour Pathology, Perfusion and Therapeutic Response (E.g Effect of Drugs on Tumour Vascularisation and the rate at which drugs given IV can reach the tumour)

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.32.44.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.32.44.png)

### MRI - Diffusion Imaging

- Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) – diffusion weighted
imaging (DWI)
- Measure diffusion (water molecules) within tissue - High diffusion produces a strong signal and appears white.
- In Normal Cells, the presence of a cell membrane restricts the diffusion of water out of the cell so very little water diffusion occurs however, when cells become Necrotic, their cell membranes become degraded, causing increased water permeability (↑ diffusion of water out of the cell), causing diffusion and hence, the signal produced by the imaging to be higher in areas of necrosis
- Low diffusion is blue, high diffusion is white.
- [Left image] LS174T tumour has necrotic centre, so high diffusion.
- [Right image] SW1222 tumour is well perfused, so less necrosis, so lower diffusion.

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.34.18.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.34.18.png)

### MRI - Hypoxia

- Hypoxia affects efficacy of radiation treatment (Chemotherapy becomes less effective/hypoxic tumours are more resistant) and is correlated with poor prognosis and more aggressive tumour types.
- Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) MRI.
- Deoxyhaemoglobin is paramagnetic, but oxygenated haemoglobin is not, meaning DeoxyHb causes surrounding water to dephase more rapidly, producing a stronger signal in areas where Hypoxia/More DeoxyHb is found
- Therefore, Studies have induced Hyperoxia via High Oxygen Gases such as Carbogen (95% O₂/5% CO₂) to look at the difference in [DeoxyHb] so that in the Hyperoxic Environment, areas that still appear very bright have a high [DeoxyHb] and hence, are likely to be Hypoxic Areas of the Tumour

# Magnetic Resonance Spectrometry (MRS)

- This is used to assess tumour metabolism and therapeutic response of tumour to drug.
- This is when magnetic imaging is used to produce a Spectrum to indicate the chemical composition of various molecules in which H or Phosphorous Can be found
- By Looking at the position of the Peak, you can indicate the compound present within the Sample and its height can be used to determine the relative quantity of that substance within the tissue
- Proton: lactate (lac – cell death), N-acetyl aspartate (NAA – neuronal integrity), glutamine (Glu – liver function), creatinine
(Cre – phosphocreatine and creatine, indicative of increased cel turnover seen in malignancy), choline (Cho – membrane activity).
- For Glioblastoma, Grading is mainly used to guide Rx as Px with Grade 1 and 2 Glioblastomas can be given therapy that will produce a response on the tumour whereas for Px with Higher Grade Tumours, there are fewer therapies that can be given as the tumours become less responsive to Chemotherapy
- Grading of Glioblastomas is difficult to achieve by anatomical visualisation due to their diffuse growth pattern within the Brain but by looking at their metabolic profile and content via MRS, this allows Grading of the Tumour to be conducted
- Phosphorous: adenosine triphosphate (ATP - 𝛽, 𝛼, 𝛾 - cell energy),
phosphocreatine (PCr – energy reserve), phosphomonoesters
(PME – cell membrane turn over) and phosphates (Pi).

# Is 1 MRI Technique Sufficient?

- As Tumours tend to be very heterogenous in composition (E.g Localised regions of Necrosis, water content, density and inflammation of the tumour can vary in different areas of the tumour
- Therefore, using only one MRI Imaging Modality does not allow for accurate visualisation of a tumour and its composition/morphology so mutliple MRI Modalities will often to be carried out to produce a comprehensive image (E.g Prostate Gland)
- T1 and T2 to Determine Anatomy of Tumour
- Contrast Scans used to better determine tumour margins and localisation of tumour
- ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient) Weighted Imaging to identify cellularity of the tumour and DWI Imaging to identify areas of Necrosis and hence, cellularity within the Tumour (Low ADC and High DWI = High Cellularity and Necrosis)

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.36.19.png](%5B030%5D%20Diagnostic%20Imaging%20of%20Cancer%20a911e51cdbf04e36a4e8be0e79c39790/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.36.19.png)

### Overview

- Highest resolution anatomical imaging when compared to other techniques.
- Good inherent soft tissue contrast suitable for tumour identification.
- Different analytic sequences can be applied to gain extra functional data about the tumour.
- Functional sequences require more complete validation before they can be universally accepted.
- Scans are relatively expensive.

# Positron Emission Tomography (PET)

### Nuclear Imaging Relies on Gamma Rays

- Gamma rays are very high energy and hence, they are attenuated by structures in the body but are not absorbed
- PET: Beta plus (β+) decay – Positron is a Man-made particle created by nuclear bombardment of elements within a cyclotron to produce a radioisotope which is proton rich and emits positrons.
- As Positrons are very unstable, with a very short half-life (minutes to hours) the Cyclotron used to synthesise the radioactive isotope must be located near the PET Scanner (Usually on site)
- SPECT: Gamma (γ) decay – normally occurs after other forms of decay (α or β) occur when the daughter nucleus has too much energy to be completely stable and hence, needs to emit this excess energy as a gamma ray.
- A positron (+1 e) is the antiparticle of an electron (1- e).
- When a Low Energy Positron produced by β+ Decay collides with a low energy electron, an annihilation event occurs
- This results in production of 2 γ ray photons, emitted at a 180° angle from one another emitted, with an energy of 511 keV, which is the signal detected by the PET Scanner.
- A 3D array/ring of detectors are comprised of crystals which luminesce/produce light when they are struck by γ rays, which can then be processed into electrical signals produce a tomographic image.
- These scanners localise coincidence events, produced by the simultaneously stimulation of Detectors found 180° apart by 2 γ rays, indicating that these rays have the same origin, which can be localised to the midpoint between the 2 stimulated detectors
- Non-Coindicence events (when 2 detectors located 180° apart are not stimulated simultaneously) are not recorded and used to help form the Image as the lack of simultaneity of signals here means that the 2 γ rays were not produced by the same annihilation event and cannot be used to localise a molecular source of the radiation
- PET does not provide anatomical imaging but provides imaging on the molecular distribution of the radiotracer which indicates the source of the radiation and the magnitude of the radioactivity seen at a specific location (indicative of the uptake rate/[Radiotracer]).
- Positron emitters and their t1/2: 15O (2 min), 13N (10 min), 11C (20 min), 18F (110 min) 64 Cu (12.7 hours), 89Zr (78.42 hours), 124I (4.2 days).

### Tumour Detection

- 18F-2 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) where one of the -OH Groups is replaced by 18F.
- 18FDG is taken up into cells via GLUT1 by cells that are undergoing glycolysis at a very high rate for energy production (High Rates of Glucose Metabolism) as 18FDG is phosphorylated by Hexokinase but cannot be further metabolised due to the lack of the -OH, causing it to accumulate within cells that have a high rate of Glycolysis and hence, provide localisation of radioactivity that is positively correlated with glycolytic rate.
- Due to this Warburg Effect, Cancer Cells have a high rate of Glycolysis and hence, rapidly take up 18FDG to allow them to be visualised using PET
- Usually, 18FDG is rapidly cleared and excreted by the Kidneys and Bladder so PET Scanning usually occurs after around an hour so that areas like the Bladder and Kidney contain low amounts of 18FDG and hence, do not produce strong signals which are detected by the PET Scanner, allowing cancers of these regions to be better visualised
- It is also important that the Px does not eat before the PET Scan as by ensuring the Px is in the Fasting State, there is little Insulin-Mediated Glucose Uptake, which would otherwise increase Glucose Uptake by peripheral tissues (E.g Liver, Adipose Tissue and Muscle) which can make it more difficult to visualise tumours within these tissues and surrounding structures
- FDG cannot be used for brain tumours as the high rate of Glycolysis within the Brain means that areas of increased Glycolysis (Brain Tumours) are poorly visualised as there is low inherent contrast here due to high background glucose uptake.

### FDG - Quantification

- The standard uptake value (SUV), is commonly used as a relative measure of FDG uptake.
- SUV = r(a’/w)
- Where r is the radioactivity concentration [kBq/ml] measured by the PET Scanner using a region of interest (ROI), based on the calibration range of the PET Scanner.
- a’ is the decay corrected amount of FDG injected [kBq]
- w is the weight of the patient [g] (surrogate for distribution volume of tracer)
- This provides a measure of % Injected Dose per gram to measure FDG Uptake

### Limitations of FDG

- Low avidity (uptake) in tumours that don’t upregulate GLUT1 due to a minimal Warburg Effect/Low Glycolytic Rate within these tumours e.g., Prostate Cancer, providing False Negative
- High background uptake in some tissues e.g., brain reduce inherent contrast here, which can make it difficult/impossible to identify focal regions of raised Glucose Metabolism within these areas, making it hard to identify tumours here
- Not tumour specific as there is high uptake of Glucose in sites of inflammation as Inflammatory Tissue upregulate GLUT1 in order to increase Glucose Uptake to support increased metabolism in Inflammation (E.g Cellular Proliferation) - This can give rise to False Positive

### PET/CT Vs PET/MRI

- As PET provides metabolic imaging rather than Anatomical Imaging, PET Scans are often superimposed onto those produced by CT or MRI to better localise areas of increased metabolic rate/tumours
- Case of a 21-year-old female with an unknown primary tumour.
- FDG indicated primary uptake within liver, with secondary metastases in lung.
- When constructing these superimposed images, Radiation Thresholding is important to consider as if there is high FDG Uptake in one area, areas of Low Uptake can be quite difficult to visualise if the Scanner has a high radiation threshold

- Case of a 45-year-old female for initial staging of colon cancer.
- FDG indicate colon mass and chain of mesenteric lymph nodes metastases.
- This provides an advantage of PET/CT as it allows for Higher Resolution Anatomical Imaging and better Soft Tissue Contrast due to the benefits of MRI over CT in these areas

### Overview

- Combination with CT/MR provides anatomical information of tumours as well as Metabolic information
- Provides better spatial and temporal resolution and quantification
- Molecular imaging (Provides information of distribution and uptake of radiotracer) - Therefore, there are several PET biomarkers in development which can show tumour progression and response to Rx
- Short-lived isotopes minimise duration radiation exposure and can be readily incorporated into biological molecules
- However, the need of PET/CT means that the CT Scan introduces additional radiation exposure to the Px, meaning that these scans can only be conducted a few times in the year in order to minimise Radiation exposure
- PET biomarkers require validation and therefore, there are only 6 validated PET tracers for cancer
- It is expensive as it requires a Cyclotron and Radiochemistry Lab on site in order to synthesise the Positron-Emitting Radioisotopes
- Despite this, it is one of the best imaging modalities for Cancer Dx as it produces a 3D Image which can be used to identify and stage a cancer (E.g TMN)

# Single Photon Emission Computerised Tomography (SPECT)

- The Signal detected in the SPECT is the result of 𝛾 ray emission by 𝛾 ray radioisotopes that emit 𝛾 rays in all directions.
- Detector is larger with multiple detectors that rotate within a Cylindrical Scanner around the Px to produce a 3D image.
- Localisation of signal source is dependent on signal intensity and x, y coordinates of the source of the radiation.
- Collimators ensure the localisation of 𝛾 rays despite radioisotopes emitting 𝛾 rays in all directions as Collimators ensure that only 𝛾 rays projecting in a certain direction can pass through and reach the detector
- These 𝛾 Rays strike and excite scintillation Crystals, which emit light that is amplified into electrical signals which are then analysed and converted into images by a computer
- In these Scanners, the SPECT cameras are found at the front of the Scanner and the CT System is found at the back so as the Px moves through the Scanner, there is initially detection of 𝛾 radiation by the SPECT cameras, followed by CT Imaging
- As the Collinators selectively filters the 𝛾 rays so that only certain 𝛾 rays projecting in certain directions are detected by the scanners, SPECT has a Lower sensitivity and resolution that PET (Harder to detect smaller cancers than PET and requires larger doses of Tracers)
- 𝜸 emitters: 99mTc (6 hours), 123I (13 hours), 111In (2.8 days), 177Lu (6 days), 131I (8 days), 125I (60 days) → Longer Half-Life than PET Radiotracers and hence, a Px is exposed to a larger radiation dose (as larger dose required for adequate visualisation of tumours), for a long period of time (due to longer half life of the radiotracers), when the Px is scanned using SPECT than PET.

### Tumour Detection

- [Image] 69 year old man with low grade metastatic mid-gut NET.
177Lu-DOTATATE confirms liver metastasis in right lobe of liver.
- SPECT scanners are more widely available than PET in UK as there is no need for On Site Cyclotrons and Radiochemistry Labs (which are expensive to establish) so tracers can be made off site and sent to hospitals.
- Currently, 12 FDA approved SPECT tracers used for cancer imaging (More than that licensed for PET):
1. Iodine-based detection of thyroid cancer.
2. 99mTc for skeletal scintigraphy.
3. 177Lu for neuroendocrine tumours (NET) → 177Lu is linked to a Neuroendocrine Analogue and hence, can be taken up by Neuroendocrine cells via Noradrenaline Transporters (which are upregulated in Neuroendocrine Tumours).
- Some SPECT tracers are also therapeutic as the 𝛾 rays can be emitted after other forms of decay that produce ionising radiation which can be used to Rx the Cancer, allowing for imaging to be done simultaneously with Rx the Px
- E.g 131-I and 177Lu are also 𝛽 emitters and as these electrons (𝛽 radiation) has less energy than 𝛾 rays, they are absorbed by cancer cells to produce DNA Damage/Breaks which lead to Apoptosis of the Cancer.

# Nuclear Antibody Imaging

- SPECT is predominantly used to look at the effectiveness of Antibody/Immunotherapy Therapy in Cancer as due to the Long Half Life of Tracers alongside the Long t1/2 of Antibodies within the Blood, SPECT can be used to assess Ab uptake by tumours and hence, assess the effectiveness of Immunotherapy
- This is done by labelling an Ab or Ab Fragments with a SPECT Tracer that emits 𝛾 Radiation that is then injected
- SPECT labelled antibody shows uptake in pelvis, axilla and uptake in skin of thigh, and right shoulder (areas of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma).
- There is high uptake in liver and presence in Gallbladder and intestines is due to Hepatobiliary clearance.
- There is also tumour specific uptake due to the specificity of Ab allowing for localisation of the margins/borders of Tumours

### Overview

- Cheap and widely available (much more so than PET).
- Applications are limited but very useful for specific tumours, notably via Nuclear Antibody Imaging.
- Antibody Labelling can be used due to the Longer Half Life of the Gamma Emitting Radiotracers however the use of Zr-89 In PET (with a longer half life) allows for more sensitive imaging whilst its long half life means that it does not necessarily need to be created on site, which can possibly make PET more widely accessible to the point where it could potentially replace SPECT
- Higher radioactive doses are required with longer half-life tracers to produce high quality images, which requires extended hospitalisation duration for Px (↑ cost).
- Less sensitive, lower resolution and less quantifiable than PET.

and in assessing therapeutic response.
- Given a comparison of clinical imaging techniques used in
oncology:
1. X ray, CT MRI and nuclear imaging.
2. Ultrasound and PAI.
- Discussed theory, application and limitations of each imaging modality. What part of tumour morphology/pathology each technique measures and how.
- Functional imaging modalities and novel biomarkers are available. Require standardisation and validation.
