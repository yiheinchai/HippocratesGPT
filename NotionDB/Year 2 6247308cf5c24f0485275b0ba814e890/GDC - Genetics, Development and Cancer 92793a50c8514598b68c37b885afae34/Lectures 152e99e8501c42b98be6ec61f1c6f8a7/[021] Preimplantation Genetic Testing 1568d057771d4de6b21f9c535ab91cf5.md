# [021] Preimplantation Genetic Testing

# Inherited Disorders - Reproductive Options

- **Options**:
1. Premarital Screening - Manditory in some countries where there is a high prevalence of a specific genetic disorder. This allows the couple to consider further genetic testing options for when they decide to have children
2. Reproductive Chance - No Genetic Testing of the Foetus is conducted
3. Remain Childless - Avoid transmitting genetic disorder
4. Prenatal Diagnosis - This is the most common option undertaken by individuals who have/are carriers for a Genetic Disorder. This is carried out after the Pregnancy has been established and means that couples may have to consider termination of pregnancy if the foetus has the inherited disorder
5. PGT
6. Gamete Donation
7. Adoption
- **Prenatal diagnosis**:
1. Free foetal DNA (from 10 weeks).
2. Chorionic villus sampling (10-14 weeks)
3. Amniocentesis (15-16 weeks)
4. Foetal blood sampling (from 17 weeks) - Often used to confirm inconclusive results
- **Decision making**:
1. Penetrance
2. Expressivity/age
3. Available treatments
4. Prophylactic surgery
5. Terminations/religion
6. Infertility → Useful to include PGT regardless of whether there is a known Inherited Disorder that the child is at risk for as Px will already be requiring IVF to maximise chance of Pregnancy due to factors reducing the risk of Natural Pregnancy
7. Personal experience
- **Preimplantation Genetic Testing**
- Testing is carried out before the Pregnancy is established so there is no need to consider termination but this requires couples to undergo IVF Regardless of their fertility status
- Cells are biopsied from the Embryos and those embryos deemed uneffected or euploid when there is a balanced chromosomal rearrangement (No Change in Chromosome Number within the embryo) are selected for transfer back into the Mother to establish a pregnancy

# Preimplantation Genetic Testing For Monogenic Disorders (PGT-M)

- PGD was initially used in families with Known Inheritable Disorders where the Germline mutation was previously identified
- PGS was used to identify Euploid Embryos from Subfertile Couples with no known genetic abnormalities to improve life birth rate after IVF
- Now, PGS and PGD have been combined to form PGT/Preimplantation Genetic Testing

### **Aims**

- To identify genetically/chromosomally normal embryos (unaffected by disorder) in couples at high risk of transmitting single gene (Monogenic) disorders or chromosomal abnormality.

### **Type of Patients**

- Mainly those who are fertile where one or both partners have a germline mutation
- Most couples who want to avoid having an unaffected Child undergo Prenatal Diagnosis - Genetic Testing after the Pregnancy has been established. Therefore, PGT-M allows couples to avoid passing on inherited disorder without the need for termination
- Couples may choose PGT-M if they have objections to pregnancy termination, they have had repeated terminations of affected foetuses previously or if they may already have an affected child with the disorder and so, they are looking to have another unaffected child (’Saviour Sibling’) who can donate Stem Cells to the affected child without risk of rejection as the unaffected sibling would be an HLA Match to the Affected Child
- This is commonly used to Dx CF, Myotonic Dystrophy and Huntington’s Disease

### **Outcome**

- Undiagnosed embryos are never transferred back into the mother and this is a relatively uncontroversial method.

---

# PGT For Structural Rearrangements (PGT-SR)

### Aims

- Identify euploid embryos
- Couples at high risk of transmitting unbalanced chromosome complement

### Types of Patients

- Usually one partner has a balanced structural/chromosomal abnormality and hence, are phenotypically normal as they have a full set of Chromosomes and genes despite, some genes being found on different chromosomes (E.g Following Translocation Chromosomal Mutation)
- Individuals with Balanced Chromosomal Abnormalities are themselves unaffected but have a risk of producing Offspring with Genetic Disorders as inheritance of One of the Mutated Chromosome to offspring gives rise to gene duplications/deletions within the offspring due to the presence of the Abnormal Translocated Chromosome Segment
- Therefore, PGT-SR identifies embryos with a Normal Karyotype or are Balanced Carriers of Chromosomal Mutations and hence, will not inherit the Genetic Disorder as there are no alterations to gene dosage within the Offspring (Still inherit all the normal genes in the correct quantities)
- Therefore, Px may opt for PGT-SR if they have a Hx of:
1. Repeated Miscarriage due to Offspring inheriting Non-Balanced Chromosomal Abnormalities
2. Repeated IVF Failure
3. Subfertility (potentially due to Lethal Chromosomal Abnormalities In Offspring)

### Outcome

- Undiagnosed embryos are never transferred back into the Mother so it is an uncontroversial method of genetic testing

# PGT For Aneuploidy (PGT-A)

- Was originally known as PGS/Preimplantation Genetic Screening and offered to couples where the female partner was of advanced maternal age (>35/38) or male partner had poor quality sperm

### Aims

- To identify euploid embryos to optimise the chances of establishing a pregnancy that will be sustained until birth.

### Types of Patients

- Often, Couples who use PGT-A do not have any known chromosomal abnormalities but it is primarily used by Infertile or sub-fertile women, particularly those with:
1. Recurrent IVF failure (≥ 2)
2. Recurrent miscarriages (with normal karyotypes)
- As transferring a single embryo in a cycle of treatment has become the regular protocol vs transferring multiple embryos at once, PGT-A has been applied to a wider range of couples, notably due to some evidence suggesting that it allows couples to more rapidly establish pregnancy which is sustained to produce a live birth
- Without selection, several cycles of single embryo transfer may be required before a live birth is achieved

### Outcome

- Undiagnosed embryos can be transferred as there is no known specific genetic predisposition to the aneuploidy that is present in the couples.
- However, this is a controversial technique as 11 RTCs have not shown an improved live birth rate when a cycle of IVF with PGT-A is compared to a cycle of IVF without PGT-A
- After a Zygote has formed, Mitotic Errors can produce Mosaic Embryos with a mixture of mutated and non-mutated cells (with different Chromosomal Sets), meaning that in rare occasions, Mosaic Embryos can be transferred into the Mother which may produce Disease in the Offspring

---

# Stages of PGT

- PGT-M and PGT-SR also have an initial step involving referral from the Clinical Genetics unit to the IVF Centre confirming the specific mutation found in one/both of the Partners
- Day 0 = Day that Oocytes are collected and sperm are prepared
- However, the woman will have undergone various weeks prior to collection involving Exogenous Ovarian Suppression, followed by Stimulation so that a large number of Ova can be collected to increase the likelihood of identifying an unaffected embryo that is suitable for transfer back into the Mother

### 1. Embryo Generation by IVF

- Fertilisation occurs by either mixing Sperm with the Oocyte (When Sperm are normal) In Vitro or via ICSI (When Sperm are Abnormal)
- Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is where a single sperm cell is injected directly into the Oocytes
- The Use of ICSI is determined by the quality of the sperm, the type of biopsy required and the specific genetic analysis protocol used
- This is carried out with molecular analysis techniques to avoid contamination from stray sperm

### Biopsy

**Polar Body Biopsy**

- Since Polar Bodies are by-products of meiosis I and II, they can be used to infer genetic material of Ova, but this means only maternal information can be analysed.
- Polar Bodies can be collected sequentially from the Mature Egg (1st Polar Body) and after the Zygote is formed (2nd Polar Body) or Simultaneously from the Zygote (1st and 2nd Polar Bodies)
- Sequential Collection allows for better discrimination between the Maternal Genome found in the 1st and 2nd Polar Body by maintaining their integrity but also puts increase stress on the Oocyte which may lead to Spontaneous Abortion
- Simultaneous Collection can lead to fragmentation/damage of the 1st Polar Body which makes it more difficult to accurately analyse their genetic composition but it puts reduced stress on the Oocyte and hence, is less likely to lead to Spontaneous Abortion
- 1st Polar Body contains Homologous Chromosomes that have been removed from the Oocyte during Anaphase 1 whilst 2nd Polar Body contains the Sister Chromatids that have been removed from the Oocyte during Anaphase 2 in Meiosis
- Polar Body Biopsy is often used in Countries where testing of Embryos is illegal

**Cleavage Stage Biopsy**

- Performed at 6-10 cell stage (day 3) with totipotent blastomeres.
- Acid Tyrodes solution or a laser is used to make a hole in zona pellucida, and 1 or 2 cells are aspirated, which are used for
diagnosis.

| Benefits | Drawbacks |
| --- | --- |
| Maternal and Paternal Genome can be analysed | Accuracy can be comprised by Mosaicism where cells that are collected are healthy but other Cleavage Stage cells may still have the mutation |
| Post-Zygotic Errors are identifiable | Involves the permanent removal of embryonic mass and so it is very invasive |
| Multiple cells are collected and analysed for accuracy | It is ethically unacceptable in some countries |

**Blastocyst Biopsy**

- Performed around day 5-6, when the Trophectoderm has differentiated
- A hole is made in the Zona Pellucida, causing the Trophectoderm to herniate out of this hole, from which 4-5 cells can be excised using a lazer
- This is the most common stage when Biopsies are taken as Embryos that have developed to the Blastocyst are more likely to implant to produce a life birth whilst the availability of multiple cells for Biopsy allows the entire genome to be analysed

### Blastocyst vs Cleavage Stage Biopsy

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Larger Number of Cells can be analysed, increasing the chance of Detecting Mosaicism | It leaves a shorter period of time where Dx can be made and the embryo can be transferred when viable |
| A smaller proportion of the Embryonic Mass is removed and hence, it is less invasive | Mosaicism within the Embryo can still produce False Negatives due to Trophectoderm cells with the mutation not being sampled  |
| It does not take cells from the ICM that contribute to the foetus, reducing the risk of Spontaneous Abortion |  |
| Fewer embryos need to be tested as not all embryos will reach the Blastocyst stage |  |
- As Transfer into the Mother must occur by Day 5-6 (When Implantation normally occurs), Embryos are often Cryopreserved after the Biopsy to allow for sufficient time to complete the Genetic Test
- This means the Mother must go through another cycle of Hormone Therapy to proliferate the Endometrium sufficiently for Implantation to take place

### Cell Free DNA

- Fluid within the Blastocoele contains Cell Free Foetal DNA and hence, Blastocentesis can be used to aspirate fluid from the Blastocoele to collect samples of Cell Free Foetal DNA for Genetic Analysis
- Suspended Culture Medium from Embryos that have been grown in individual cultures can also be used as a source of Cell Free DNA to minimise damage to the Embryo

### Single Cell Diagnosis

**Flurescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH)**

- PGT-SR (Balance Structural Rearrangement in Parents)
- PGT-A

**PCR**

- PGT-M (Monogenic Disorders)
- PGT-A (Real Time PCR)

**Whole Genome Approaches**

- PGT-SR (NGS/Array CGH)
- PGT-M (SNP-Array)
- PGT-A (NGS/Array CGH)

**FISH Method**

- It uses fluorescently labeled DNA probes, with different fluorescing a different colour when bound to their target DNA, which are applied to Embryonic Cells with interphase or Metaphase Chromosomes that are fixed onto slides
- Heat is used to denature the Chromosomes and Probe into single strands and the probe then hybridises to its complementary DNA Target within the Chromosomes of the embryonic cell that has been fixed onto a slide, causing the probe to fluoresce to identify the Target DNA/Chromosome
- In PGT-SR, Probes are selected that hybridise to the Chromosomes involved in the Balanced Chromosomal Rearrangement seen in one of the Parents
- By counting the number of spots, this reflects number of copies of chromosome in the sample to identify Embryos with Chromosomal Inbalances.
- In PGT-A, Probes are selected that target Chromosomes that if present in an abnormal number of copies would still lead to a viable pregnancy (Chromosomes 13,18,21, X and Y)
- Embryos are selected based on whether they have the correct number of Chromosomes/FISH Probe Signals to allow for a Viable Pregnancy to occur
- However, as not all the Chromosome within the Embryonic Cell are tested, Aneuploidy for Non-Tested Chromosomes can still be present and remain undetected, meaning these embryos are still transferred, potentially leading to Genetic Disorders

# Single Cell FISH - Possible Causes of Misdiagnosis

- Hybridisation failure - DNA Probes fail to hybridise to their complementary chromosomes, preventing the Identification of the Chromosome
- Overlapping signals - Prevents identification of individual chromosomes from FISH signals
- Cumulus Cells surround the Ovum and if these are not removed before biopsy, they can contaminate the sample and hence, reduce its acuracy
- FISH is carried out on Cleavage Stage Cells, where Post-Zygotic Mutations can give rise to Mosaicism within the Embryo, meaning the Biopsied Cell may not have the same Karyotype as the wider embryo, reducing the accuracy of FISH

---

# Chromosomes in Human Embryos

### Type of Cells

- **Normal**: all cells uniformly diploid.
- **Abnormal**: all cells uniformly abnormal/aneuploid where the aneuploidy has arisen in the Gamete during Meiosis in Gametogenesis (trisomy 21).
- **Mosaic**: 2 or more cell lines present (mutated and non-mutated cells within the Zygote) due to Post-Zygotic Errors in Mitosis
- **Chaotic**: Different chromosome pattern in every nucleus.

### Evolution of PGT-A

- What is best method - NGS on the Blastocyst with a Trophectoderm Biopsy as it allows for analysis of all the Chromosomes within a cell (Paternal and Maternal) and several cells can be tested at once, increasing the accuracy of the Testing by allowing more accurate identification of Mosaicism.

---

# Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

- Detects mutations in DNA (rather than chromosomes) and so used to identify Monogenic disorders
- This can be conducted via Haplotype Analysis or Haplotype Analysis and Mutation Detection

### Method

- **Denaturation**: heat to separate double strands.
- **Annealing**: primer binds to template sequence just upstream to the target DNA Sequence.
- **Elongation**: primer extension with addition of dNTPs by Taq polymerase.

### Use of Microsatellites

- In PGT-M for Haplotype Analysis, STRs are used as Markers for potential genetic mutations
- If Primers are targetted against the STRs at a specific location, this allows PCR Products to be generated that are variable in size dependent on the length of the STR in the Target Location
- As STRs are highly variable in repeat length across the Population, the Specific Length of an STR for a specific Chromosome in the Embryo can be used to identify which parent the Chromosome was inherited from
- Tags can be placed on the Primers to allow the PCR Products to fluoresce in different colours, to allow multiple PCR Reactions involving different STR Markers to occur simultaneously whilst still being able to analyse each STR Marker individually

### Diagnosis by Haplotype Analysis

- Used to Investigate dominantly inherited disorder
- Uses alleles at Unique STR markers on each of the Homologous Chromosomes to track the inheritance of the chromosome with the germline mutation between affected relative
- This is done by identfying the alleles that the Affected Parent and Child have in common at the STR Markers (Identified by identical peaks produced by the same STR Marker on PCR Graphs), that are genetically linked to and flank the gene of interest on the same Chromosome (Alleles in Phase with the Mutation)
- Therefore, this allows for the identification of the Chromosome inherited from the Affected Parent to the Child, allowing for the Identification of the allele on the Non-Inherited Chromosome of the Affected Parent, the allele on the Common Chromosome between the Child and the Non-Affected Parent and hence, the allele on the Non-Inherited Chromosome of the Non-Affected Parent by using a different STR Marker to identify the alleles on these chromosomes
- Therefore, by analysing the STR Markers on the Homologous Chromosomes associated with Normal and Mutated Alleles in the Parents and the Child, this allows for the identification of the Inheritance of Chromosomes containing the Mutated Alleles in Embryos, where if the Offspring’s PCR Graph for the gene of interest produces an identical signal to that seen in the Affected Parent, the Embryo has the Mutated and will not be implanted

![Screenshot 2022-03-06 at 18.47.48.png](%5B021%5D%20Preimplantation%20Genetic%20Testing%201568d057771d4de6b21f9c535ab91cf5/Screenshot_2022-03-06_at_18.47.48.png)

### Diagnosis by Haplotype Analysis

- Requires analysis of STR markers linked to the mutation
- If markers are found >1MB away from the mutation site, there is a risk of a Chiasmata forming between the STR Marker and the Mutated Allele, causing the Marker and the Allele to not be coinherited (alters Haplotype in Offspring), preventing Dx from being achieved
- Requires DNA from appropriate relatives with the mutation in family to determine the alleles found in phase with the mutation
- It is important that the STR Markers used are significantly different from one another to allow for each of the Chromosomes to be distinguished from one another to accurately track inheritance of the affected allele
- There is no need to test for the precise mutation as it is the STR that is targetted, not the mutated allele

### Diagnosis by Haplotype Analysis with Mutation Detection

- For some couples who have no family members affected with the disorder, it is not possible to determine the Phase of the Mutation (Which of the 2 Chromosomes the Mutation is found on) using the STR Marker
- Alleles in phase with the mutation need to be determined in the PGT-M cycle via the addition of PCR Primers that amplify the Mutation Site and then applying an mutation analysis technique (E.g Minisequencing) to identify the presence of the mutation within the Embryo
- To check that the mutation analysis within the PGT-M Cycle is accurate/correct, the Alleles associated with the linked STR markers that are in phase with the mutation should be the same across the individuals with the mutations to ensure that the mutation has been correctly localised to a specific locus on the affected Chromosome

### Factors Affecting Single Cell PCR

1. Amplification efficiency:
- Cell can lyse during transfer to PCR-tube from the Culture.
- Cell was anucleate or degenerating
1. Allele drop out:
- This is where a heterozygous sample appear to be homozygous as one of the alleles fails to amplify due to DNA Breaks in the Amplicon on one of the Chromosomes.
- Therefore, to prevent the effects of Allele Drop Out on the accuracy of Single Cell PCR, Multiple Targets are used to produce a Dx to ensure that despite allele drop out at one targets, there are still Linked Targets that are amplified to confirm the presence of the Allele
- Failure of Amplification and Allele Drop Out can be overcome using Multiple Cells from a Trophectoderm Biopsy, making Trophectoderm Biopsy to become more accurate than Cleavage Stage Biopsy in this regard
1. Contamination:
- It is essential to Remove/destroy of contaminants and employ stringent experimental practices.
- This can be done by removing all cumulus cells from the Ovum and use ICSI.
- This is important as STR Polymorphism means that a specific STR Repeat length fingerprints the maternal and female chromosomes so the presence of unexpected alleles within the Parents (Not Identified using STR Marker Analysis of Mother and Father) indicates contamination

---

# Whole Genome Approaches

### Whole Genome Amplification Methods

There are 2 main groups of Methods to amplify the entire genome of an Embryo:

1. PCR-Based Methods
- DOP-PCR, Genomplex and Surplex
1. Multiple Displacement Amplification
- Following Amplification, DNA Fragments of Varying Sizes can be found along the Gel
- PCR-Based Approaches generate smaller sized fragments Vs MDA
- PCR Approaches produce a more even amplification of DNA across the Genome
- However, numerous errors can be introduced into the Amplicon Sequence during PCR Based Whole Genome Amplification as small contaminations of the Initial Sample are also amplified
- MDA produces large amounts of High Molecular Weight DNA (Large Fragments), with few errors being incorporated into the Sequence and hence, there is little contamination of the Final Amplified Product
- However, MDA does not amplify all parts of the Genome evenly

### Next Generation Sequencing

- Whole Genome Amplified DNA from the Biopsied Cell can be used to identify Aneuploidy using PGT-A or PGT-SR using NGS
- DNA from the Biopsied cell is amplified using PCR-Based Whole Genome Amplification Approach

---

# PGT-A By NGS

- Whole Genome Amplified DNA is comprised of DNA Fragments (Produced by PCR) is then analysed using NGS, where each fragment is sequenced a number of times
- If a part of a Chromosome/Whole Chromosome is lost/gained, then the number of times that the fragments from that affected region are sequenced will be altered in comparison to the number of sequences produced from unaffected Chromosomes
- Where there is a deletion, there will be fewer sequenced fragments and where there is a duplication, there will be more sequences in comparison to non-affected DNA Chromosomes
- The Sequences Fragments are then aligned to the reference sequence of the Human Genome (Indicative of the Amount of Sequences present when a non-mutated Genome is sequenced) to produce a Horizontal Trace, where the X Axis represents the Chromosomes on which the DNA Fragments are found and the Y Axis represents the Sequence/Repeat Number
- If there is a section of the Trace that is found below the Horizontal Trace produced by the other DNA Fragments, this indicates that there are fewer sequences and hence, a Deletion Mutation

![Screenshot 2022-03-06 at 22.48.12.png](%5B021%5D%20Preimplantation%20Genetic%20Testing%201568d057771d4de6b21f9c535ab91cf5/Screenshot_2022-03-06_at_22.48.12.png)

### MDA Whole Genome Amplification

- When MDA is used for Whole Genome Amplification, the product produces a Genomic Template which can be used to set up numerous PCR Amplifications of STR Markers that flank the region where the Gene of Interest is found (Similar to Process used for PGT-M but in PGT-M, there is no whole genome amplification)
- The Additional Step of Whole Genome Amplification in PGT-M generates a large amount of Source DNA, generating many STR Markers in a large enough quantity to be targetted by PCR and used for Dx
- There is a limited amount of DNA available from a single cell/group of cells, making Dx of Genetic Conditions from Direct PCR Amplification difficult

---

# Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) Array

- SNPs are found widespread across the genome, in a greater quantity than STRs
- Although STRs are very informative as there can be many different allele sizes at each locus, which can be located by STR Markers, SNPs can only identify 2 Alleles at each locus as they SNP Assays measure single base pairs at a specific locus
- Identification of the Location of SNPs to a specific chromosome can be used to genetically fingerprint the Embryo and track the Inheritance of the Chromosomes between generations by tracking the presence of the SNPs on specific Paternal Chromosomes
- This analysis can be conducted through Whole Genome Analysis
- The NDA can be used to form a Whole Genome Amplified Product that is applied to a Chip containing >300,000 SNPs from all over the Genome, which can be used to Genotype the entire Embryonic Genome
- In order to determine the Haplotype (Group of Alleles Inherited from a Single Parent) of the Embryo, DNA is required from Both Parents and a relative with a known genetic status/SNP Genotype for the Familial Disorder, each requiring a Separate Chip

### Analysis of SNP Information

- If One Parent is Heterozygous for the SNP within the Gene of Interest but one parent is Homozygous for the SNP at the same Locus, if the Embryo is Heterozygous, then this means that the Common Allele between the Heterozygous Parent and the Embryo was transmitted from the Heterozygous Parent
- If the Embryo has the same SNP Genotype as the Reference Family Member, who contains a common allele with the Heterozygous Parent, this means that the Common Allele between the Embryo and the Heterozygous Parent is in phase with the Disease Allele (Present in the Reference Family Member Genotype), meaning the Embryo has inherited the disorder
- If the Embryo does not have the same SNP Genotype as the Reference Family Member, who contains a common allele with the Heterozygous Parent, this means that the Common Allele between the Embryo and the Heterozygous Parent is not phase with the Disease Allele (Present in the Reference Family Member Genotype), meaning the Embryo has not inherited the disorder

![Screenshot 2022-03-06 at 23.30.22.png](%5B021%5D%20Preimplantation%20Genetic%20Testing%201568d057771d4de6b21f9c535ab91cf5/Screenshot_2022-03-06_at_23.30.22.png)

### Key/Non-Key SNPs in Embryos

- Using SNP Analysis, it is possible to determine what alleles are inherited from each parent and also, potential Crossover events that can arise
- Some SNPs = Key SNPs as even if an allele drop out event has occurred during Analysis, the parental origin of the Allele can still be determine
- Non-Key SNPs are those that cannot be used to determine the parental origin of an Allele if an Allele Drop Out Event has occurred

---

# Aneuploidy Information From SNP Arrays

- As the Alleles at each SNP are determined by the Intensity of the SNP Allele Signals at each Locus in a Heterozygous Individual, Software can be used to determine if 1 allele has 2x the amount of Intensity (and hence, is duplicated) as the other allele at the same locus
- When Analysing the SNPs Signals from a Single Chromosome produced by an Individual who is Diploid for that Chromosome, The Signals produced by the SNPs can be separated into 3 vertical lines - Those corresponding to each allele (A&B) individually and both alleles together (Heterozygous Genotype - AB)
- When Analysing the SNPs Signals from a Single Chromosome produced by an Individual who is Trisomic for that Chromosome, The Central Set of SNP Signals produced by the combination of both alleles is divided into 2 signals (AAB and ABB) due to the presence of an additional copy of the 2 alleles due to an additional/duplicated Chromosome

![Screenshot 2022-03-06 at 23.38.27.png](%5B021%5D%20Preimplantation%20Genetic%20Testing%201568d057771d4de6b21f9c535ab91cf5/Screenshot_2022-03-06_at_23.38.27.png)

---

# Summary

- Whole genome amplification allows for the whole genome to be analysed
- Low coverage NGS allows for single method of analysis for aneuploidy detection in PGT-A or PGT-SR
- Use of SNPs (Karyomapping) allows single method of analysis for monogenic disorders in PGT-M
- Karyomapping can also provide aneuploidy information

---

# Chromosomal Mosaicism

- Present at all stages of preimplantation development due to post-zygotic mutations, meaning a single sampled cell may not have a genome that is representative of that of the wider embryo
- Mosaicism can be present within the Blastocyst but as a Trophectoderm Biopsy is the most common stage at which Biopsy occurs, Mosaicism can be detected in the sample via the sampling of multiple cells
- This allows for estimations to be made about the degree of mosaicism seen within an embryo, which has led to Embryos with Low Levels of Aneuploidy (due to Mosaicism) occurring in a Chromosome that would not lead to a Viable Pregnancy being deemed suitable for transfer into the Mother when there are no fully euploid embyros available

![Screenshot 2022-03-07 at 00.01.46.png](%5B021%5D%20Preimplantation%20Genetic%20Testing%201568d057771d4de6b21f9c535ab91cf5/Screenshot_2022-03-07_at_00.01.46.png)

---

# Mitochondrial Disorders

- It remains difficult to apply PGT to analyse Mitochondrial Disorders due to Heteroplasmy as it involves determination of the ratio between mtDNA with and without the mutation in 2 separate cells from a Cleavage Stage embryo (Mutational Load)
- When Mutational Load is low, the Embryo may be considered for Transfer

---

# Spindle or Pronuclear Transfer

- For Some Px, the Mutational Load of all Ova is very high and in these cases, Maternal Spindle/Pronuclear Transfer may be used
- This involves a Donor Egg with a Low Mutational Load which is anucleated so  the Maternal Genome from the Ova with the High Mutational Load can be inserted, to produce an Ovum with a Low Mutational Load but still containing the Maternal Genome

![Screenshot 2022-03-07 at 00.07.18.png](%5B021%5D%20Preimplantation%20Genetic%20Testing%201568d057771d4de6b21f9c535ab91cf5/Screenshot_2022-03-07_at_00.07.18.png)

# Causes of Misdiagnosis in PGT

- Some can be Human Errors (E.g Mislabelling or Misinterpreting Samples), Intrinsic (Errors that occur due to Features within the Embryo such as Mosaicism) and Extrinsic (Errors due to the Analysis Process such as Allele Drop Out)

---

# Limitations, Ethical Issues and Future of PGT

- For PGT to be conducted, all couples must undergo IVF (regardless of Fertility status), which is very expensive
- Women undergoing IVF may also only produce a few embryos suitable for Biopsy and even following Dx, there may be no embryos left which can be transferred into the Mother, reducing IVFs success rate
- Within the UK, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) decide which Genetic Disorders can be tested for using PGT, ensuring that only severe disorders can be tested for to prevent PGT being used Maliciously (E.g Eugenics)
- However, this leads to Ethical Issues such as:
1. What is a Serious Disorder?
2. Can PGT be used for HLA Typing to allow for Saviour Siblings to be produced or to select the sex of Offspring (Designer Babies)?
- PGT can be conducted to reduce the risk of Polygenic Disorders (Polygenic Risk Prediction)
- Variations in PGT Regulations across different countries has led to Reproductive Tourism where a Px may travel to a country where PGT Regulations are less strict to undergo PGT and then return to their home country to allow them to bypass Stricter PGT Laws
