# [028] An Introduction to Cancer Biology

# Cancer

- 50% of Px will develop cancer in their lifetime, with 46% of these individuals dying from cancer (Predominantly Lung Cancer, Large Bowel, Breast, Prostate and Oesophageal)
- Tumorigenesis: formation of a new growth or growths.

### Cancer is caused by Multistep Genetic or Epigenetic Changes

**Origins of damage:**

1. Inherited (Germline Mutation)
2. Replication errors (Somatic Mutation)
3. Carcinogens (chemical, radiological, viral)
4. Genetic instability
5. Inflammation.

**Limiting effects**

- DNA Damage Repair
- Apoptosis of Damaged Cells which can potentially become malignant as they are replicating abnormally
- Cell senescence to prevent cellular proliferation
- Immune surveillance to destroy potentially malignant cells that express abnormal/non-self Cancerous Ag before they proliferate sufficiently to overcome Host Defenses
- Minimising Exposure to Carcinogens
- Anti-Carcinogens (E.g Antioxidants or Anti-Inflammatory Drugs like NSAIDs)
- Screening for Inherited Genetic Defects in Offspring

### Cancer is Caused by Genetic Damage

- Various Environmental and Genetic Causes can give rise to DNA Mutations within Tumour Suppressor Genes and Oncogenes
- This can lead LoF of Tumour Suppressor Genes and/or GoF of Oncogenes (This commonly occurs together) leading to Malignant Transformation and hence, Cancer
- Epigenetic Alterations caused by mutagens can also alter the expression of genes which can further contribute to the development of Cancer
- Potential Mutagens can be Infection (E.g Introduction of Viral Oncogenes into the Human Genome), Chronic Inflammation, Ionising Radiation, Inherited (Familial Cancers) or DNA Replication Errors

# Carcinogenesis

- Over 40% of Cancers are preventable, with the major leading causes of Acquired Cancers being Smoking, Obesity and Alcohol

### Alcohol

- Can cause 7 types of cancer (notably Oesophageal, Breast and Bowel Cancer)
- In Px with a strong FHx of Breast and Ovarian Cancer, they may choose to undergo surgical removal to prevent Breast and Ovarian Cancer from developing
- Within the Body, Alcohol is converted into Acetaldehyde, which is extremely reactive and Genotoxic, preferentially inactivating BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are usually responsible for DNA Repair
- This causes Mutations within the Genome to become permanent and accumulate, increasing the risk of Malignant Transformation to produce cancer)
- Alcohol also leads to increased Oestrogen Levels, stimulating the proliferation of Oestrogen Sensitive Tissue (Uterus, Breast and Ovaries) which can increase the risk of Uterine, Breast and Ovarian Cancer, where Oestrogen Receptors are ofter over-expressed
- Alcohol can also interact with other risk factors for Cancer to contribute to the development of other cancers (E.g It can be a solvent for Tobacco Carcinogens)

### Carcinogenesis - Tobacco Smoke

- Principal genotoxic chemicals (mutagens) in tobacco smoke:
1. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH): Class I Carcinogen
2. Nitrosamines
3. Many others (arsenic, chromium, formaldehyde).
- Benzo(a)pyrine is a Procarcinogen PAH that is activated via metabolism in the body to form an Epoxide that can intercalate with the DNA Double Helix by binding with Guanine Bases, to distort the double helix, preventing DNA Replication from occurring correctly which causes DNA Damage
- Tobacco itself also a significant risk factor for other cancers such as Renal and Bladder Cancer due to the presence of Genotoxic Chemicals.
- Tobacco Smokes generally exhibit a Greater mutational load vs non-smokers.
- Tobacco smokers often have an Excess of G → T transversion mutations within their Genome.
- Mutational hotspots (where the majority of mutations are localised to) can be found in the p53 tumour suppressor.
- Same Genetic signature in oropharyngeal cancers amongst Tobacco Smokers.

# Development Of A Cancer (Malignant Tumour)

- Cancer begins in a single cell, usually at epithelial surface as the majority (80%) of cancers are Carcinomas.
- Most Cancers are Carcinomas (Cancers of Epithelial Tissues) as:
1. Epithelial Tissues have a high replication/proliferation rate and hence, accumulate mutations more rapidly than other tissue types, increasing the risk of once cell undergoing a malignant transformation
2. Epithelial Tissues are usually found on the External Surface of the Body in contact with the environment and hence, are more likely to come into contact with Environmental Mutagens, meaning they are more likely to undergo malignant transformation to become cancerous
- Further irreversible/permanent mutations accumulate sequentially in the affected cell following replication and selective pressure (E.g Tumour Microenvironment or Cytotoxic Drugs) leading to the mutated cell acquiring an increasingly aggressive phenotype so that the tumour cell evolves/adapts to acquire new capabilities that allow it to thrive in the microenvironment around it, which give rise to the hallmarks of Cancer
- These mutations include Normal Cell → Oncogene Activation → TSG Inactivation → Immortalisation → Genetic Instability → Resistance to Apoptosis and Immune Surveillance → Cancer Cell
- As Cancer is a Multistep Process involving multiple different mutations (which occur at a low rate with each replication) that co-occur within a Cell to produce cancer, one combination of a specific set of mutations within a single cell is very rare, with the high incidence of cancer despite this being that multiple different combinations of mutations (E.g Different TSGs mutated) can give rise to the same cancer phenotype

### Genetic Mutation Does Not Directly Drive All Processes of Cancer

- Epigenetic control of expression of normal genes by regulating transcription is also important via:
1. Chromatin accessibility (How tightly Chromatin is wrapped around histones)
2. DNA methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation or ubiquitination status.
3. microRNAs
- These all determine how accessible a DNA Sequence is to RNA Polymerase and hence, how readily the gene is transcribed and therefore expressed
- Cancer related protein expression profiles depend on genetic and
epigenetic changes.
- Activation of oncogenes drives cellular proliferation by stimulating increased intracellular signalling (pressing accelerator).
- Inactivation of tumour suppressors removes control of cell growth (prevents cellular arrest) by causing unregulated progression of cells through the various stages of the cell cycle (releasing brake).
- Immortalisation permits indefinite replication of cells without development of senescence/apotosis (regular refuelling).

### Immortalisation

- Most cells become senescent (Resting State where they do not divide/replicate further) or die (As successive Telomere Shotening causes Chromosomal Instability, leading to Cellular Apoptosis) after 30-60 divisions (Hayflick Limit) as Telomeres (TTAGGG) repeats shorten with each cell division in normal adult cells.
- In cancer, foetal and germ cells, telomerase is expressed which maintains telomere length by increasing telomere length during cellular division to cause no net change in Telomere length following Mitosis
- Telomerase is the product of the hTERT gene in humans but is not normally expressed in adult somatic cells (but hTERT is expressed and uregulated in Cancers)
- This means that these cells can replicate indefinitely without becoming senescent or dying as telomeres do not shorten, so chromosomal instability does not develop as a result.

### Common Targets of Genetic Damage

1. Tumour Suppressor Genes (Rb, p53, PTEN)
2. Oncogenes (HER2, EGFR, PI3K)
3. DNA Damage and Repair Proteins (BRCA1) → These correct mutations in DNA and when these mutations are large enough, they can cause Apoptosis of the affected cell to prevent Malignant Transformation into Cancer

# Tumour Progression in the Development of Colon Cancer - Oncogene Activation and Tumour Suppressor Gene Inactivation

- Loss of APC is inherited in some familial conditions causing Normal Colonic Epithelium to Hyperplastic Colonic Epithelium
- DNA Hypomethylation (Epigenetic Modification) causes the development of an Early Adenoma with the activation of K-ras (Potent Oncogene) and 18q TSG causing the progression from Early → Intermediate → Late Adenoma respectively
- The Loss of p53 (TSG) causes the development of a Late Adenoma into a Carcinoma, allowing it to invade the basement membrane and metastasise to wider tissues

![Screenshot 2022-03-08 at 23.45.13.png](%5B028%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Cancer%20Biology%208e1796e01fcd42f8a22d392cf806fd59/Screenshot_2022-03-08_at_23.45.13.png)

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 13.07.59.png](%5B028%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Cancer%20Biology%208e1796e01fcd42f8a22d392cf806fd59/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_13.07.59.png)

- Different genes may combine in different permutations to produce the same cancer phenotype.
- This means that whilst there can be a predictable set of mutations to specific genes seen in certain cancers (E.g Colon Cancers) some Px with Colon cancer can have a unique combination of mutations to different genes that carry out similar functions

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 13.11.46.png](%5B028%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Cancer%20Biology%208e1796e01fcd42f8a22d392cf806fd59/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_13.11.46.png)

- Through Genetic Mutations, GoF to Oncogenes and LoF to TSGs means a cell is predisposed to undergoing excessive cellular proliferation, which is sustained by Immortalisation to allow for the uncontrolled proliferation of the single mutated cell to form a Malignant Tumour, which can reach very large sizes

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 13.13.27.png](%5B028%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Cancer%20Biology%208e1796e01fcd42f8a22d392cf806fd59/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_13.13.27.png)

# Invasion

- Malignant Cells eventually acquire further mutations which leads to the expression of Proteases that degrade the basement membrane, allowing Malignant Cells to become mobile and invade through the Basement Membrane into Capillaries/Lymphatic Vessels to allow for metastasis to wider parts of the Body

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 13.16.37.png](%5B028%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Cancer%20Biology%208e1796e01fcd42f8a22d392cf806fd59/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_13.16.37.png)

# Tumour Stroma - The Microenvironment

- Tumour Stroma is comprised of the Malignant Cells themselves and Non-Tumour Cells (Parenchymal and Vascular Cells) in the region surrounding the Tumour and forms the Tumour Micorenvironment
- These support, nourish and protect the Malignant Cells and hence, the progression of Cancer, making it a new therapeutic target to prevent the development of Cancer
- The Tumour Microenvironment is mainly comprised of non-tumour cells (E.g Recruited Immune Cells such as Macrophages)
- Macrophages secrete growth factors that promote the invasion of wider tissues by the Malignant Cells and hence, disease progression

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 13.20.57.png](%5B028%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Cancer%20Biology%208e1796e01fcd42f8a22d392cf806fd59/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_13.20.57.png)

### Angiogenesis

- New Blood Vessels develop via Angiogenesis through the expression of Angiogenic Proteins that stimulate blood vessel generation in the region near the tumour
- These New Blood Vessels provide metabolic support for the rapidly growing tumour cells (allowing the tumour to continue growing) whilst also providing a method of Malignant Cells to enter the wider bloodstream by intravasating through these vessels to allow them to metastasise to wider parts of the Body

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 13.23.36.png](%5B028%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Cancer%20Biology%208e1796e01fcd42f8a22d392cf806fd59/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_13.23.36.png)

# Metastasis

- Whilst PET Scans can identify large metastases and hence, secondary tumous, they often cannot identify Micrometastases (Small Groups of Cells/Single Cells found widespread throughout the body) due to a limited resolution of the PET Scan
- Wide Metastasis of Cancer usually is a sign of Poor Prognosis

---

# Sequential Process of Metastasis

1. Transformation
2. Angiogenesis
3. Motility and Invasion
4. Multicell Aggregates (Lymphocytes and Platelets)
5. Embolism and Circulation (Transport)
6. Arrest in Capillary Beds (Adherence)
7. Extravasation into Organ Parenchyma
8. Response to Microenvironment
9. Tumour Cell Proliferation and Angiogenesis
10. Metastases to form Secondary Tumours, followed by Metastasis of Metastases
- Large tumour masses can result from these processes and also, as it allows the formation of multiple tumours from a single tumour, it can lead to exponential spread of Malignant Cells throughout the body

![Screenshot 2022-03-08 at 23.48.37.png](%5B028%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Cancer%20Biology%208e1796e01fcd42f8a22d392cf806fd59/Screenshot_2022-03-08_at_23.48.37.png)

# People Die of Cancer Due to Loss of Homeostasis

- Infiltration into vital organs, reducing/altering the functionality of that organ.
- Pressure from tumour masses compressing structures and hence, damaging them or altering their function.
- Breaching natural barriers to infection, causing increased susceptibility to infection.
- Side effects of treatment which can cause damage to normal tissues and disrupt normal physiology/organ function.
- Psychological effects of debilitating illness.
- Paraneoplastic Syndromes which are clinical syndromes that occur in parallel with the occurence of a tumour, with Sx of these syndrome usually presenting and hence, being Dx’ed before the cancer becomes clinically apparent
- This means that Dx of Specific Paraneoplastic Syndromes can provide indications for what possible cancer a Px may have and hence, what Rx can be used to Rx the Cancer

# Treatment

### Management of Cancer

- Avoid risk of cancer by reducing exposure to risk factors
- Identify and screen groups at risk (E.g by taking FHx and looking for Familial Cancers or via Screening of Populations using Imaging or Genetic Analysis).
- Diagnose at earliest possible stage where cancer is less likely to have metastasised widely and hence, is easier to Rx and has a better prognosis.
- Establish extent of spread - Local treatment for localised disease (E.g Surgery or Focused Radiotherapy) and Systemic treatment for systemic disease (E.g Chemotherapy).

### Principles of Cancer Treatment

- The Majority of Curative Rx for Cancer comprise of Surgery (Around 50%) and Radiotherapy (40%) - Chemotherapy = 10% of Curative Rx
- Principles of Cancer Rx = Surgery, Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy

**Surgical Oncology/Surgery**

- Prevention of Cancer (Commonly for Px with Familial Cancers) so that organ where cancer is likely to occur is removed to prevent cancer from occurring
- Evaluation: biopsy (E.g of Tumour and Lymph Nodes) and diagnostic evaluation of Cancer to guide Rx and predict prognosis.
- Treatment: importance of margins as it is important to remove the entirety of the tumour and enough surrounding tumour (where some Micrometastases may be present) to prevent tumour recurrence.
- Palliative procedures to relieve Sx caused by Physical Presence of Tumour and its disruption of surrounding tissue for those with Terminal Cancer

**Radiotherapy**

- Malignant cells are generally sensitive to radiation as Radiation energy damages DNA to lead to Apoptosis of the Malignant Cells to cause death of the tumour
- The main principle is to minimise damage to normal tissue whilst ensuring that the tumour is damaged enough to be destroyed.
- Example: external beam radiotherapy (applied in fractions over the span of around 2 weeks to avoid damage to healthy tissues),   brachytherapy (Implantation of short t1/2 Radioactive compounds close to the tumour to release radiation near to the tumour to produce localised radiation exposure), proton beam therapy (allows for deliver of a specific dose of radiation to a very small area to allow for high focusing of Rx to maximise damage and destruction to cancer cells whilst minimising damage to healthy tissues)

**Chemotherapy**

- DNA damaging agents (usually chemicals) that interfer with DNA or RNA synthesis to prevent cell division and hence, prevent growth of tumours.
- These can also be targeted treatments that have a high specificity to localise the Chemotherapy to minimise damage to normal/healthy surrounding tissue (small molecules, mAbs).
- However, the use of single drug targets in targeted drug therapies means that Cancer cells can quickly mutate this drug target to provide a survival advantage, leading to drug resistance
- Combinations of Surgery, Radiotherapy, Chemotherapy and more recently, Immunotherapy are sometimes appropriate and effective

### Systemic Treatment

# Summary

- Usually, Cure and Control of Cancer is possible at the stages of Carcinogenesis during and prior the acquisition of a sequence of irreversible mutations that allow the Malignant Cell to assume a more aggressive and invasive phenotype
- Beyond this, Metastasis and Growth of Tumours acts in a Positive Feedback Mechanism which makes it difficult to cure and control the cancer
