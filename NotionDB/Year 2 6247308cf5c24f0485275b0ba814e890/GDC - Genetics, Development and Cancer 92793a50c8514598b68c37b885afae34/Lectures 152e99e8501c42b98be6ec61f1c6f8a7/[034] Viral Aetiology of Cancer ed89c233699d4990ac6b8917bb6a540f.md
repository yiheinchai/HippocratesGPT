# [034] Viral Aetiology of Cancer

# Viruses and Cancers

- Worldwide cancers attributed to infections is 16.1% worldwide. As high as 22.9% in LEDCs and 7.4% in MEDCs.
- 1/3 of these cases are a result of hepatitis B/C (Hepatocellular Carcinoma ‚Üí Usually presents as an Abdominal Swelling), and another 1/3 to HPV (Carcinomas/Epithelial Cancers)
- Helicobacter pylori also causes Gastric Cancer by producing chronic inflammation, which increases the risk of Cancer Developing via Dysplasia
- Cottontail Rabbit Papillomaviruses cause benign tumours in rabbits and when these lesions are exposed to carcinogens, they can progress to cancers ‚Üí This shows that as well as directly causing cancers, Viral Infection can be a risk factor that predisposes an individual to developing cancer
- Usually, Virally Caused Tumours are not mechanisms to support the survival and spread of the virus but are usually accidental occurrences containing viruses that no longer replicate

### Cancers Attributable to Viruses

### RNA

| Retroviridae | ALV, HTLV-1, HIV |
| --- | --- |
| Flaviviridae | Hepatitis C |

### DNA

| Papillomaviridae | HPV and BPV |
| --- | --- |
| Hepadnaviridae | Hepatitis B, DHV |
| Herpesviridae | EBV, KSHV, MDV |
| Polymoviridae | MCV, SV40 |
| Adenoviridae | No Human Adenoviruses have been discovered cause tumours in their Host, despite producing tumours in model organisms |
- All Viruses contain genes that alter the activity of the cell cycle and suppress apoptotic mechanisms to promote cell survival and proliferation to aid the spread of the virus but only a few viruses are able to actually cause cancers via these mechanisms

### Timeline

sarcoma. It was also found that transplanting lesions from
cottontail rabbits infected with papillomavirus into
different rabbit species led to cancer. |

- Burkitt‚Äôs Lymphoma usually manifest as swelling around lymph nodes, notably Submandibular Nodes in the Jaw
- KSHV/HHV8 can cause Kaposi‚Äôs Sarcoma in Immunocompromised  Px (Usually Px with AIDS), a Fibroblastic Tumour that usually manifest as multiple small red/purple blotches on the skin and gums
- Merkel‚Äôs Cell Carcinoma is mainly seen in Immunosuppressed Individuals, rarely seen in Immunocompetent Pxs
- Almost all Cervical Cancers are caused by Human Papillomaviruses

# Mechanisms of Malignant Transformation By Infectious Agents

### Virus Induced Transformation

- **Mechanisms**
1. Introduction of an active oncogene.
2. Inhibition of tumour suppressors (Inhibition of Apoptotic Mechanisms).
3. Stimulation of mitosis.
- These genes usually promote cell survival and proliferation but can contribute to cancer when they become deregulated
- **Examples** - HBV, HTLV-1, MCV and HPV

### Chronic Inflammation

- Chronic Inflammation stimulates cell death and proliferation, increasing the risk of cells acquiring mutations that cause Dysplastic Changes that can lead to Cancer
- **Mechanisms**
1. Production of inflammatory cytokines, ROS and RNOS.
2. ‚Üë cell cycling and proliferation.
3. DNA, protein and membrane damage.
4. Gene expression changes.
- **Examples** - HCV and Helicobacter pylori

### Immunosuppression

- Immunosuppression causes reduced immunosurveillance and immune destruction of cancer cells, increasing the risk of other Cancer Cells avoiding the immune system and proliferating to cause cancer
- **Mechanisms**
1. Altered control of cytotoxic lymphocyte responses.
2. Virus-encoded direct antagonists.
- **Examples** - HIV

# Viruses and Neoplasia

### General Rules

- There is an inverse relationship between successful virus
replication and cell transformation - A virus is either replicating or
inducing neoplasia (usually when virus does not successfully replicate).
- Viruses in tumours are sometimes referred to as abortive/pseudolatent infections (infection is no longer productive, transforms to produce neoplasia instead).
- Virus-associated cancers often arise from chronic infection - Viral infections alone are not sufficient but peristence of viruses in cells predispose the cell to accumulating mutations over time that lead to cancer.
- Cancers caused by viruses are a biological accident and offer no
fitness/survival advantage for the virus.

### Detecting Infectious Agents In Cancer and Proving Causality Is Difficult

- This is because often, Viral Genomes can be found incidentally in tumours but the viruses themselves do not cause the tumour
- We use Koch‚Äôs postulates to show causality between an infectious agent and a disease but this doesn‚Äôt work well for cancer:
1. The agent should be present in every case of the disease under appropriate circumstances ‚Üí An infectious agent may trigger the initial events of oncogenesis/carcinogenesis but be asbent in the final tumour which makes it harder to identify their causal role as they are not present in the tumour and hence, cannot be identified (E.g Œ± and Œ≤ Papillomaviruses)
2. The agent should not be present in any other disease as a fortuitous and non-pathogenic agent ‚Üí As cancers often occur as Biological Mistakes in a disease process, the virus will not be found solely in the cancer as it will be causing a wide range of other diseases also
3. The agent must be isolated from the body of the disease individual in pure culture, and it should induce disease in a new susceptible animal ‚Üí Often, only a few viral genes are important in oncogenesis and hence, present in the cancer, so it is very rare that the entire virus will be present in the tumour in a form that can be isolated and analysed

# Papillomavirus

### Origin

- Epithelial viruses causing epithelial carcinomas.
- First appeared 300-400 Mya as skin developed, therefore, this long period of coevolution of skin and Papillomaviruses means that Papillomaviruses have become well adapted to the host by adapting new mutations to thrive in the differentiated epithelium of various different species.
- They produce only asymptomatic infections.

### Human Papillomavirus Types

- There are over 200 human papillomaviruses distributed into 5 (Œ±,Œ≤,Œ≥,Œº and ŒΩ) groups, with the 2 main groups being ùõº and ùõΩ groups.
- It is mainly the Œ± Papillomaviruses that cause cancers as it is this group that contains High Risk Strains that commonly cause cancer (Other types of Papillomaviruses are low risk)
- HPV2 and HPV57 (ùõº group): causes cutaneous common warts (benign epithelial tumours).
- They are considered low-risk for cancer but in immunodeficient Px, these warts can enlarge and multiply on the body (Papillomatosis).
- Œº and Œ≥ (Mainly HPV4) Papillomaviruses are a small group that cause Verucas/Plantar Warts on the Feet which are not cancer associated
- ùõΩ Papillomaviruses - Most people are infected with these viruses but these usually are ASx as the Immune System prevents them from forming warts but in immunodeficient individuals, cause widespread warts (papillomatosis) which can be Rx by restoring the immune system (E.g Bone Marrow Tx)
- Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (ùõΩ group) - This is a rare inherited disease caused by ùõΩ papillomaviruses, caused by a cell mediated defect which predisposes an individual to developing skin cancers

### High and Low-Risk Human Papillomaviruses

- Low Risk ùõº (HPV6 and HPV11) Papillomaviruses infect the same sites as High Risk ùõº Papillomaviruses but do not generally cause cancers here, instead causing Laryngeal Papillomas and Genital Warts
- They can sometimes cause cancers in Px who have chronic infections, which are usually established in early life
- There are no current antivirals that can Rx Papillomavirus Infection so these growths must be removed surgical removement of the bulk of the tissue, with the remainding tissue being removed by laser Rx or immunomodulation
- Laryngeal Papillomas are commonly seen in children after birth where children become infected as they pass through the birth canal of a mother who is infected and has genital warts - They are Rx by repeated surgical removal
- High-risk: ùõº genus can cause cancer (cervical, anal, oropharyngeal).
- They cause almost all cervical cancers, 90% of Anal Cancers and 30-50% of Oropharyngeal Cancers
- Both High and Low Risk Papillomaviruses have a circular genome, but the position of their genes, promoter regions and splice sites differ
- Papillomavirus genomes (both high and low risk) have E1 and E2 genes (packaging), and L1 and L2 genes (replication) but accessory genes that help the papillomavirus survive in its specific host epithelial environment differ.
- Mutations acquired as a result of evolution means that there are extra E6 and E7 genes in High Risk Papillomaviruses which aren‚Äôt present in Low Risk Papillomaviruses.
- HPV 16 cancers are caused due to E6 and E7 expression, acting as
oncogenes.
- HPV16 causes 55% of all Cervical Cancers, with the 2nd most common viral cause of Cancer being HPV18

### High-Risk Papillomavirus

- These are often called direct carcinogens as they contain genes that must be continuously expressed in the host cell to produce Malignant Transformation
- These are members of the ùõº Papillomavirus Genus and are widespread in the population, transmitted sexually.
- They cause flat lesions that are not noticed by patients (visualised using dilute acetic acid) and remain as productive infections on the penis and cervix.
- Normally these lesions are cleared by the immune system.
- In immunocompromised patients, the infection persists, allowing these flat lesions to grow and slowly become more dysplastic to from a cancer
- The HeLa Cell line is an immortal cell line comprised of cervical cancer cells that are used to understand basic cellular physiology
- There is an integrated fragment of the Human Papillomavirus within the HeLa Cell Genome that allows them to show automatous growth to maintain the cell lineage whilst also providing it with immortality - This inserted fragment (E6 and E7) of High Risk Human Papillomavirus is also seen in many cervical cancers and are continuously expressed to allow for the growth of the cancer
- However, Carcinogenic Viruses do not cause cancers in every cell that they infect due to differences in viral gene expression within different tissues, which results in certain viruses only producing tumours at certain sites

### How Papillomavirus Causes Cancer

- Ectocervix (epithelium connecting vagina to cervix) is made of stratified epithelial cells. These are present from birth.
- Endocervix (epithelium connecting cervix to uterus) is made of
simple columnar epithelial cells.
- From the point of puberty, the columnar cells begin transforming
(process known as metaplasia) within the Transformation Zone between the Ectocervix and Endocervix, begining to layer on one another form stratified epithelial cells.
- This layering effect serves a protective function and is what
normally happens to columnar cells that are irritated.
- When the virus infects Junctional/Reserve cells (Stem Cells) of the transformation zone, dysregulation of gene expression occurs, allowing cervical cancers to occur within the Transformation Zone.
- HPV can also infect the Columnar Epithelium of the Endocervix and the Glandular Tissue of Cervical Glands where it can cause Squamous Cell Carcinomas and Adenocarcinomas
- Break in epithelium (e.g Microwounds) allows the virus to infect the basal membrane, where it expressed E6 and E7 to cause the infected cell to proliferate, producing a reservoir of infection in the Basal Epithelial Layers that can persist for many years
- Dividing basal cells give rise to infected daughter cells that migrate towards the epithelial surface, expressing additional E1, E2, E4 and E6 genes that allow for viral genome proliferation, which is then packaged into viral particles via L1 and L2 viral gene expression to allow these additional viruses to be released, producing a peristent cycle of infection
- Sometimes, E6 and E7 expression within these proliferating cells can become dysregulated/overexpressed, leading to the formation of various grades of Cervical Neoplasia (Dependent on whether the Neoplastic Cells are found only in the basal layers of the Cervix or throughout all layers of the Cervical Epithelium)
- Eventually, Overexpression of E6 and E7 leads to very rapid cellular proliferation, allowing various mutations to accumulate which leads to cancer
- High risk viruses are very effective at driving basal membrane cell proliferation via E6 and E7, where as low risk viruses are less well at driving cell proliferation as they lack these genes.

### Effects on The Cell Cycle

- The Cell Cycle is regulated by Cyclins (Notably Cyclin D and its associated Kinase CDK)
- Basal epithelium responds to growth factors released from
underlying dermis, which activates cyclin D and its associated kinase CDK, which is then able to phosphorylate pRb (regulator in cell cycle).
- This releases transcription factor E2F, which allows expression of cell cycle proteins required to drive cell cycle entry.
- A -ve feedback system through p16 inhibiting Cyclin D and CDK ensures that entry to the cell cycle is regulated to prevent excessive cell proliferation.

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 15.31.58.png](%5B034%5D%20Viral%20Aetiology%20of%20Cancer%20ed89c233699d4990ac6b8917bb6a540f/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_15.31.58.png)

### Effect of E7

- It doesn‚Äôt require Cyclin D and CDK Activation or Growth Factors to produce growth as it binds directly to pRB and displaces E2F transcription factor, which causes E2F to be released, allowing for Cell Cycle genes to be expressed which allows for cell cycle entry and hence, proliferation.
- -ve feedback via p16 that works to inhibit cyclin D no longer acts to regulate cell cycle entry as cyclin D is no longer used for this growth process and p16 cannot inhibit E7, leading to unregulated cell cycle entry and hence, excessive cellular proliferation.

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 15.32.47.png](%5B034%5D%20Viral%20Aetiology%20of%20Cancer%20ed89c233699d4990ac6b8917bb6a540f/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_15.32.47.png)

### Effect of E6

- E6 targets p16 and p14 (regulatory protein).
- p53 is a TSG that is usually upregulated in response to genetic mutations and excessive cell cycle entry by inhibiting cellular growth and activating apoptotic pathways in order to prevent proliferation of mutated cells and excessive proliferation
- The activity of p53 is usually regulated by Mdm2 which is bound to p53 but p14 binds to Mdm2, causing it to dissociate from p53 to allow p53 to accumulate and hence, become active
- Without the activity of E6, excessive cell cycle entry due to E7 activity would cause p14 to be expressed in high amounts to increase the levels of p53 found within the cell to combat excessive growth
- However, E6 binds to p53 and recruits Ubiquitin Ligase to ubiquitinate p53 which targets it for destruction/removal by the cell to prevent p53 from oppose E7-Mediated Proliferation

### Summary of E6 and E7

- E7: allows cell to enter cell cycle by removing E2F transcription
factor and displacing the normal cyclin D signal to prevent -ve feedback by p16/p14.
- E6: removes p53 (normally inhibits cell growth and stimulates apoptosis), allowing cell to grow.

### Adenovirus Equivalents

- The E6 and E7 proteins are a common way that viruses induce the
cell cycle to produce increased proliferation of infected cells.
- Adenoviruses employ the same tactics through E1A (E6 Analogue), and E1B (E7 Analogue) equivalents that also target pRB and p53 respectively.
- Polyomavirus also contain T-Ag which has the same function of E6 and E7 in Papillomaviruses by binding to pRb and p53

# Preventing Cervical Cancer

### Cervical Screening

- By staining Cervical Epithelium with E4 Papillomavirus Markers, you can see the Localisation of Papillomavirus throughout the layers of the Cervical Epithelium which can help to determine the Grade of Neoplasm (CIN1,2 or 3) to determine the risk of Cancer Development occurring
- Smear testing allows for the detection of cancers that occur
slowly over time.
- Screening is highly effective and ‚Üì incidence and mortality; however, it does not impact incidence and mortality associated with Cervical Cancer in women < 30 years of age.

### Vaccination

- In the HPV Vaccine, the L1 Gene from the Human Papillomavirus Genome is removed and put in a recombinant viral expression vector
- The L1 Proteins produces assemble into Virus Like Particles, which can then be purified and mixed with adjuvants to improve their efficacy before being injected to stimulate immunological memory against the Human Papillomavirus Ag
- HPV vaccine given to year 8 girls since 2008.
- Cervarix: HPV 16, 18 (protects against cancers).
- Gardasil: HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 (protects against cancers and genital warts).

# ùú∑ Genus Papillomaviruses

- Low risk viruses that are commonly found in the skin and around hair follicles, widespread in the population but do not cause visible disease.
- When ùú∑ Papillomaviruses infect basal epithelial cells, they prevent those cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to genetic mutations.
- ùú∑ HPV E6: prevents repair of genetic damage (keeping infected
cell alive).
- ùú∑ HPV E7: not thought to be a potent driver of cell proliferation.
- ùú∑ Papillomavirus Gene expressed can be regulated by the Immune System in Immunocompetent Px, allowing these basal cells to apoptose in response to mutations to prevent the proliferation of mutated cells which can lead to cancer
- In immunocompromised patients infected with a ùú∑ Papillomavirus like HPV5, dysregulation/overexpression of ùú∑ Papillomavirus Gene expression occurs so therefore Excessive UV light exposure in these Px causes genetic mutations which persist in the accumulated infected cells as ùõΩ HPV E6 prevent DNA Repair from occurring and prevent the mutated basal cell from apoptosing
- This leads to an accumulation of genetic errors, ‚Üë likelihood of
cancer.
- Reduced Immune Regulation of Viral Genome Expression leading to dysregulation and over expression of viral genomes can be seen in KSHV Infection in Px with AIDS, where excessive expression of KSHV Viral Genome leads to the development of Kaposi‚Äôs Sarcomas
- ùõΩ HPV genomes are usually absent from keratinocyte cancers as they cause the cancer via a hit and run mechanism by acting to predispose the cell to accumulate mutations during Carcinogenesis but their viral genomes are not required to sustain Carcinogenesis (Carcinogenesis is sustained by the activity of the mutated host genes instead)

---

# Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (Merkel Cell Carcinoma)

- Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare aggressive skin carcinoma
associated with immunosuppression.
- Merkel cell polyomavirus genomes and large T antigen are detected in > 80% of cases.
- Like papillomaviruses, most people are infected with MCV as
children but in most individuals, immunosurveillance suppresses the expression of the viral genome causing the infection to lie dormant, producing a very low risk of cancer due to the infection.
- Immunosuppression (with old age, Anti-Rejection Medication with Rx or Infections that Immunocomprise Pxs), virus reactivation can occur which allows the virus to remerge and eventually integrate itself into the host genome
- When the viral genome that is inserted into the Host Genome is mutated (E.g T-Ag Truncation Mutations), this produces Dysregulation of Viral Genome Expression to produce replication-defective viruses that express fragments of T-Ag and other viral oncogenes that are able to drive uncontrolled cellular proliferation
- When T-Ag Gene Truncations are integrated, the segments of the Gene that allow T-Ag to suppress p53 and pRb are not mutated to ensure that the entry of the mutated cell into the cell cycle is unregulated to produce Unregulated Cellular Proliferation

---

# Viruses and Primary Hepatocellular Carcinoma

- Hepatocellular Carcinoma can be caused by Hep B (Hepadnavirus) or Hep C (Flavivirus)
- Hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B virus): small, partially double stranded genome.
- X gene is involved in viral integration into the host genome.
- Impacts on many cellular pathways:
1. Apoptosis (binds and inactivates p53).
2. Cell cycle regulation.
3. Signalling pathways
4. DNA repair
5. Transactivation (enhances recruitment of CBP/p300 coactivator to promoters).
- Flavivirus (hepatitis C virus ‚Üí RNA Genome that encodes a single polypeptide that is procesed to produce multiple smaller proteins)
- Whilst both viruses encode genes that are involved in immune evasion and driving cell proliferation, their main mechanism of carcinogenesis is Chronic Inflammation
- HBV and HCV account for vast majority (80%) of cases of HCC
(hepatocellular carcinoma) with HBV being the major player, resulting in 320,000 deaths/year.
- Hepatocellular Carcinoma occurs in a subset of Px with Chronic Hepatitis B Infections and occurs after a long latent period usually, many years after Primary Infection

### Mechanisms of Transformation

- 2 potential virus-specific mechanisms of virus action in addition to
immune/chronic inflammatory damage:
1. Virus integration resulting in insertional mutagenesis.
2. Effect of X gene and other HBV gene products on cellular proliferation (but not HBV gene unequivocally been shown to have transforming activity).

# Epstein-Barr Virus (HHV4)

- Associated with Burkitt‚Äôs lymphoma and nasopharyngeal
carcinoma.
- Disease association is linked to mode of infection.
- Transmission during kissing, can lead to infectious mononucleosis, most commonly in young adults/teenagers, where B Cells become infected by EBV and hyperactivated due to poor regulation of the excessive B Cell Response by T Cells.
- But in most individuals, infection occurs as young children and is inapparent.
- Primary lytic infection occurs in the mucosal epithelium of the
nasopharynx and salivary glands, and while this is happening, the
virus establishes a latent infection in B cells that infiltrate the local
lymphatic tissue.

---

# Burkitt‚Äôs Lymphoma (BL)

- Development of BL is favoured by weak immune response as this allows Chronic Infection and tolerance to the virus, causing infected individuals to be ASx.
- Most individuals control the infection (asymptomatic carriers).
- Overactive immune response favours development of infectious
mononucleosis.
- It mainly affects children in certain parts of East Africa and New Guinea. as the geographical location of BL Occurrence is restricted due to co-factors (e.g. Plasmodium falciparum/Malaria).
- BL is a histological entity and doesn‚Äôt always require EBV Infection to occur
- EBV +ve BL expresses EBNA1/EBERS (known as latency 1
transcription pattern)
1. EBNA1: nuclear protein necessary for viral maintenance by driving proliferation of infected cells.
2. EBERS: regulatory RNA molecules modulating innate immunity and prevents apoptosis to allow for infected cells to persist and accumulate to form the BL.
- Chronic Infection by EBV alongside B Cell Proliferation, induced by recognition of other Ag (E.g Plasmodium falciparum Ag) by the Infected B Cells, leads the accumulation of mutations (notably Chromosomal Translocations) that drive malignant transformation

### Burkitt‚Äôs Lymphoma and c-myc

- c-myc dysregulation is a universal component found within Burkitt‚Äôs Lymphoma.
- Reciprocal translocations of chromosome 8 (c-myc) with chromosomes 2, 14 or 22 (lg loci) are also seen in ubiquitous non-EBV BL tumours.
- It is the Myc translocation, not the presence of EBV, that defines BL.
- Polyclonal B cell activation by either chronic malaria or HIV infection will ‚Üë risk of chromosomal translocation due to increased cellular proliferation.

---

# Kaposi‚Äôs Sarcoma Herpesivurs (KSHV/HHV8)

- Rare and indolent (progressing slowly) tumour of elderly men of
Mediterranean origin (Italy and Middle East).
- Endemic (seen in sub-Saharan Africa) where it can be seen mainly in children and is more aggressive (not linked to HIV involvement).
- In Uganda, 60% of the population is seropositive for HHV8.
- AIDS-associated Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma: HIV +ve individuals have a
20,000 fold relative risk compared with HIV -ve.
- Within HIV +ve group, male homosexuals have a 15-20 fold risk compared to infected blood product recipients.
- This supports the view that a sexually transmitted agent is a co-factor in KS development

### KSHV Oncogenic Mechanisms

- Many virus genes with effects on cell growth have been identified.
- Classical view is that those genes expressed in latency are the
oncogenes which can drive cellular proliferation.
- However, in KS, activation of the lytic cycle and expression of lytic genes due to a poor immune response vs KSHV plays a role in tumour development.
- KSHV also expresses other genes that can contribute to cell persistance and accumulation of mutations by allowing the mutated cell to avoid immune destruction, inhibit apotosis and promote cell proliferation

---

# Key Principles of Tumour Viruses

- In Viral Infection of Basal Epithelial Cells, Regulated/Controlled expression of viral genes drive the proliferation of mutated cells and the production of new virions
- However, When Viral Infections cannot be resolved and persist, Expression of the Viral Genome can become deregulated in specifc cell types, causing unregulated cell proliferation which can lead to the formation of cancer
- Over time, this can lead to progressive Neoplasia of a higher grade and as genetic mutations accumulate, there is an increased risk of the Neoplastic Cells undergoing Malignant Transformation for cancer cells
- In Human Papillomavirus, this is facilitated by the Integration of the Viral Genome into the Host Genome and loss of E2, causing dysregulation of E6 and E7 expression so that they are overexpressed, causing uncontrolled cell proliferation
- If the Immune System can suppress the viral infection sufficiently, this can lead to a significant reduction in Viral Gene Expression, causing Chronic Inapparent/Pseudolatent Infection
