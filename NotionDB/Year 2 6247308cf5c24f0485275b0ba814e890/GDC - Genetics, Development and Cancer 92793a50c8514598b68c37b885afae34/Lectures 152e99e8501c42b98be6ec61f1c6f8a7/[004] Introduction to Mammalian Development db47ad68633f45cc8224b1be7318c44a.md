# [004] Introduction to Mammalian Development

# First Week of Human Development

- Sperm and egg usually meet in ampulla region of oviduct.
- Over next 5 days, fertilised egg will undergo a number of cleavage
divisions as it moves down oviduct to uterus, whilst within the zona pellucida to prevent implantation within the Fallopian tubes.
- It first forms a morula (16 cells) and then a blastocyst (50-100 cells), with trophoblast and inner cell mass, which implants into uterine wall 6-9 days after fertilisation.

- At the 8-cell stage the embryo becomes compacted via the expression of cell surface adhesion molecules to maximise surface contact with other cells, forming an outer polarised trophectoderm layer surrounding an apolar inner cell mass, establishing apico-basal polarity.
- The loss of totipotency commences at the 4-cell stage as different sister cells contribute to different blastocyst lineages.
- The first cell fate completes at the 32-cell stage; the second cell fate decision completes at the late blastocyst stage.
- Blastocoele is formed by trophectoderm pumping Na⁺ into the centre of the blastocyst, which draws water inside the morula osmotically to displace the ICM to one side of the cell (Embryonic Pole).
- The side of the Blastocyst where the Blastocoele is found, opposite the embryonic pole, is the ab-embryonic pole
- Initially, Hypoblast and Epiblast cells are interspersed throughout the ICM but as the Blastocyst develops further, these cells separate to form a hypoblast layer adjacent to the blastocoele and an epiblast layer adjacent to the Trophoblast

- In the mouse embryo, most cells are polarised following compaction, with an outer cell layer containing localised components such as Ezrin, associated with microvilli.
- These polarised cells will activate the transcription of genes required for trophoblast development (e.g. Cdx2).
- Deep apolar cells have no outer membrane and are not polarised, activating transcription of pluripotency genes required for ICM development (e.g. Oct4).

### Hippo Signalling

- In the morula stage embryo (16–32 cell stages), the Hippo signalling component protein AMOT becomes tethered to the apical domain
- This inactivates Hippo signalling and prevents Yap phosphorylation, triggering the translocation of Yap and Taz proteins to the nucleus where they activate Cdx2 and Gata3 expression to specify trophectoderm (brown) fate.
- In the apolar cells, Yap is phosphorylated it, labelling it for degradation or localising it to the cytoplasm
- The lack of apical domain means AMOT associated to other membrane proteins, allowing Yap to be phosphorylated which prevents its translocation to the nucleus
- This activates Hippo signalling so  the resulting lack of Cdx2 and Gata3 expression allows the cells to express pluripotency gene (such as Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2) to specify ICM fate.

# Epiblast/Hypoblast

- During the second cell fate decision, ICM cells express Nanog and Gata6, with these different cells found interspersed in the ICM, expressing varying amounts of these proteins
- The expression of Gata6 prompts the expression of Fgfr1/2, whereas Nanog prompts the expression of FGF.
- The communication between cells expressing different levels of Nanog and Gata6 by FGF signalling allows the separation of Nanog and Gata6 into two cell populations by inducing Epiblast/Hypoblast Specific Adhesion Molecules to allow Epiblast and Hypoblast cells to attract one another and separate into 2 distinct populations
- This means that the cells expressing high [Nanog] will become epiblast (EPI) by suppressing Hypoblast gene expression, whereas the cells expressing high [Gata6] will become primitive endoderm/Hypoblast (PE) by suppressing Epiblast gene expression.

# Cell Fate in Mammalian Blastocyst

- Trophoblast (T) (trophectoderm in non-primates) contributes to chorion of placenta (embryo’s contribution to placenta) via the Syncytiotrophoblast and Cytotrophoblast
- The inner cell mass (ICM) divides into epiblast and hypoblast layers, with the Hypoblast differentiating into the extraembryonic endoderm of yolk sac.
- Epiblast forms 3 embryonic germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm) as well as the Amniotic Membrane and extraembryonic mesoderm which forms the Chorionic vasculature.

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%205.png)

---

# Embryonic Stem Cells

- ICM cells can be cultured in vitro as pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESC) in appropriate conditions to initially induce proliferation and then cell differentiation into a wide variety of tissues.
- They can be used for studying differentiation, producing cells and tissues for transplantation, identifying new drugs, toxicity testing and for modifying genome.

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%206.png)

# Gastrulation in Mammalian Embryos

- ICM divides into epiblast and hypoblast layers and a ridge appears in caudal epiblast on day 14.
- This is known as primitive streak and is first indication of gastrulation.
- A mound of cells, primitive node, appears at rostral end of primitive streak on day 15.
- Epiblast cells break away from each other, migrate towards the primitive streak and ingress through the primitive streak and node.
- First cells invade through the primitive node and rostral primitive streak to invade the underlying Hypoblast layer, displacing the Hypoblast to the periphery of the Epiblast whilst this epiblast layer forms embryonic endoderm.
- Subsequent cells migrate through the primitive streak into space between epiblast and endoderm, forming mesoderm.
- Cells remaining in epiblast layer that do not ingress form ectoderm.

# Mesoderm Formation

### Mesoderm and Endoderm

- Mesoderm and endoderm can be seen in the chick primitive streak using a technique called in situ hybridization, which shows the distribution of mRNA of interest.
- Brachyury mRNA is expressed by all mesoderm cells and is localized to the primitive streak and node.
- Chordin mRNA is expressed by axial mesoderm (notochord) and is localized to the node.
- Wnt8a is expressed by non-axial mesoderm and is localized to the primitive streak but not the node.
- Sox17 mRNA is expressed by endoderm cells and is localized to the anterior primitive streak and node
- Sox17 is not expressed in the centre of the primitive streak and node, where mesoderm is found.

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%207.png)

### Mesoderm Formation

- Cells ingressing through node form axial mesoderm (prechordal mesoderm and notochord) just deep to the Primitive Streak and Node.
- Mesoderm from primitive streak condenses either side of notochord, forming paraxial mesoderm, intermediate mesoderm and lateral plate mesoderm moving laterally/away from the Notochord.
- They are specified by secreted morphogen from axial mesoderm.

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 20.23.37.png](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_20.23.37.png)

### Chordin and BMP

- Chordin mRNA is expressed by the node and axial mesoderm, while mRNA for Bone Morphogenetic Protein (Bmp2, Bmp4, Bmp7) is expressed by the posterior primitive streak, lateral plate mesoderm, and non-neural ectoderm.
- Chordin is a secreted proteins that bind, and inhibit, Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP) from the TGFβ Family that act via Serine-Threonine Kinase Cell Surface Receptors.
- BMP Binds to the extracellular domain of STK1 and STK2, bringing the Cytosolic Domains together so that STK2 can phosphorylate STK1 to activate the STK1 so it can activate intracellular signalling pathways
- They prevent BMP from binding and activating their receptors to prevent BMP Activity.
- Chordin diffuses from the Axial Mesoderm to more lateral regions of Mesoderm whilst BMPs diffuse from lateral mesodermal regions towards the Axial Mesoderm
- This establishes a gradient of Chordin and establishes a counter gradient of BMP, where Chordin is high in the Axial Mesoderm and lower in Lateral Mesodermal Tissue whilst BMP is high in Lateral Mesodermal Tissue but low in Axial Mesoderm, meaning BMP Signalling increases moving laterally from the Axial Mesoderm
- BMP acts as a morphogen to establish different fates within the mesoderm, with BMP inducing Lateral Plate Mesoderm, Intermediate Mesoderm, Paraxial Mesoderm and Axial Mesoderm as it moves from High to Low Concentration.

# Formation of the Primitive Streak

- In chick embryos, the epiblast is composed of a central area pellucida (AP) which forms embryonic tissue and a peripheral (extra-embryonic) area opaca (AO) in contact with the underlying hypoblast.
- The boundary between these two regions is known as the marginal zone (MZ).
- A local thickening of the posterior/dorsal area pellucida/posterior marginal zone is known as Koller’s sickle (KS) and is the site where the primitive streak (PS) forms.
- Cells of the other regions of the area pellucida migrate towards Koller’s sickle to extend it anteriorly, leading to the formation of the primitive streak extending along the midline of the area pellucida towards the anterior/rostral side.

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%209.png)

### Induction of the Primitive Streak

- If the posterior marginal zone (PMZ) is grafted into a different location in the marginal zone of a host embryo then a second primitive streak (PS) is formed, indicating that the PMZ induces the primitive streak.
- The PMZ expresses a gene called Nodal and Vg1, which encode TGF-β proteins (Nodal and GDF3) which in turn induce the formation of the primitive streak.
- Grafting cells expressing Vg1 or Nodal to the anterior marginal zone induces the formation of the primitive streak in the anterior epiblast.

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%2010.png)

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%2011.png)

### GDF3 and Nodal

- Gdf3 and Nodal continue to be expressed in the primitive streak as both genes are required for the induction of endoderm and mesoderm.
- Members of the TGFß family form dimers and GDF3 and Nodal can form either homodimers or heterodimers, with the C-Terminus of both molecules being cleaved by proteases to form the active molecule
- The GDF3-Nodal heterodimers have a higher activity than the GDF3 or Nodal Homodimers.
- The evidence is that they act as morphogens, inducing endoderm at the the highest concentration, then axial mesoderm, followed by more caudal mesoderm.

![Screenshot 2022-02-27 at 17.18.19.png](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Screenshot_2022-02-27_at_17.18.19.png)

### Mesendoderm Induction

- As well as inducing primitive streak formation, Nodal and GDF3 are also responsible for Mesoderm and Endoderm induction

**Zebrafish**

- Maternal plus zygotic KO of GDF3 gives embryos with no endoderm or mesoderm.
- Maternal plus zygotic KO of Nodal (cyclops & squint) gives embryos with no endoderm or mesoderm.

**Frog**

- Inhibition of maternal GDF1 (Vg1) gives embryos with no dorsal mesoderm (structures formed by the Primitive Node in mammals).
- Inhibition of zygotic Nodal (nodal5 & nodal6) gives embryos with no endoderm or mesoderm.

**Mouse**

- Zygotic KO of Nodal gives embryos with no endoderm or mesoderm as they do not form a primitive streak.

# Neural Plate

- Signals from axial mesoderm induce neural plate in overlying ectoderm rostral to primitive node.
- As embryo expands, through mitosis, primitive streak becomes restricted to caudal margin of epiblast, a phenomenon known as regression.
- The size of primitive streak remains largely same size, but epiblast surrounding it is proliferating at a high rate, so the Primitive streak takes up a smaller proportion of space of the embryo.
- Expansion of the Rostral End of the Endoderm causes the expansion of the Neural Plate between the Caudally Restricted Primitive Streak and the Buccopharyngeal Membrane at the Rostral end of the Embryo
- Neural plate then begins to fold along midline groove, raising lateral edges (neural folds).

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 20.24.12.png](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_20.24.12.png)

---

# Formation of the Neural Tube

- Lateral edges of neural plate meet and fuse during 4th week of human development, forming neural tube.
- Edges initially meet at only a single site, at boundary of hindbrain and spinal cord, but there may also be additional rostral sites.
- Rest of tube closes like a zipper, with caudal neuropore closing last of all.
- Failure to close rostral neuropore causes anencephaly and caudal neuropore causes spina bifida.

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 20.24.49.png](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_20.24.49.png)

---

# Neural Plate Formation

- Sox2 is activated in the developing neural plate in response to signals from the node (n).
- It encodes a transcription factor required for neural plate development.
- Using whole mount in situ hybridisation, we can see its mRNA and thereby visualize the neural plate as it forms during gastrulation, here in the chick embryo.
- It initially forms in early gastrulae (HH4), as a horseshoe pattern around the node and anterior primitive streak (ps), but gradually expands anteriorly along the midline of the ectoderm, anterior to the node, where it then folds to form the neural tube.

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%2012.png)

---

# Neural Induction

- Experiments on fish, amphibian, chick and mammalian embryos have shown that the neural plate is induced during gastrulation by dorsal/axial mesoderm (notochord and prechordal plate), which in mammals is formed by the node.
- The node and its derivatives secrete inhibitors (e.g. Chordin and Noggin) of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), a signalling molecule that instruct ectodermal cells to form epidermis.
- Studies on amphibian and fish gastrulae suggest that inhibiting BMP is a key component of the neural inducing signal by preventing epidermal induction
- Studies on chick suggest that inhibition of BMP is not sufficient for neural plate induction, Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGF) and possibly other signals are also required.

---

# Organisers

- Spemann & Mangold (1924) transplanted the organizer in the dorsal embryo to the ventral side of the embryo and found that a conjoined twin was formed.
- Transplanted cells to the ventral side formed the notochord and a few somites instead of lateral plate mesoderm, while host cells formed most of the paraxial/somites, intermediate, and ventral mesoderm due to the establishment of an additional Chordin-BMP Counter Gradient in the Ventral Embryo.
- Spemann suggested that the organizer was the source of signals that specified different mesodermal fates.

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%2013.png)

### The Node is an Organiser

- Grafting the node to a new location in the epiblast causes the formation of a second embryo, in which the graft forms the notochord and parts of the neural tube and mesoderm due to the establishment of an additional Chordin-BMP Counter Gradient in the Ventral Embryo.
- Most of the neural tube and mesoderm is formed by host cells.
- This result has been demonstrated for both birds and mammals.

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%2014.png)

---

# Neural Induction

- In the chick embryo, a node graft into the extra-embryonic area opaca (blue) in the boundary close to the Epiblast area results in the induction of ectopic neural tissue.
- Here, we can see strong induction of Sox2, 12-hrs after the graft.

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%2015.png)

- A node graft induces the expression of various genes that are necessary for the development of the Neural Plate, at different times.
- For those induced within 3 hours (red), expression normally begins before primitive streak formation and are unaffected by BMP Inhibition.
- Genes induced in 4-5 hours (blue) are normally expressed from mid-primitive streak stages when BMP Inhibition is seen, while those induced after 12 hours (green) are expressed at the end of gastrulation, in the forming neural plate where they are involved in the specification of the Nervous System.
- Early markers, but not late markers, can be induced in the area opaca by a bead of FGF whereas late marker expression requires BMP Inhibition.

![Untitled](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Untitled%2016.png)

### Neural Induction in Animals

- The node, notochord and prechordal mesoderm secrete signals (FGF) that induce early neural plate markers in the overlying ectoderm.
- They also secrete BMP inhibitors (Chordin and Noggin) that inhibit epidermalizing signals (BMP4).
- FGF and the absence of BMP signalling (due to Chordin Expression) induces early and late neural tube markers while specifying the neural plate, while later BMP signalling specifies the epidermis that overlies the neural tube.
- e = epidermis, n = node, np = neural plate, not = notochord, pcm = prechordal mesoderm, ps = primitive streak.

# Paraxial Mesoderm Forms Somites

- Paraxial mesoderm either side of the notochord form a compact mass of mesenchyme, which at its rostral end buds off to form paired balls of epithelial cells called somites.
- In chicks, a new pair of somites forms every 90 minutes and every 4-5 hours in human embryos.
- Number of somites formed varies between different species due to differing number of vertebrae across organisms but is about 42 in humans (subsequently ↓ to 37 as the tail portion of the embryo degenerates).
- New cells are added to posterior end of paraxial mesoderm as they ingress through primitive streak to add to the unsegmented paraxial mesoderm.
- Somites form in a rostral-caudal fashion.

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 20.25.54.png](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_20.25.54.png)

---

# Somite Formation

- Somite identity is specified by combining a gradient of FGF/WNT signalling (primitive streak produces these but once cells ingress, they no longer transcribe FGF/WNT and therefore, the FGF/WNT gradient in the Paraxial Streak is highest nearest primitive streak caudally and lowest rostrally) and an oscillating clock mechanism.
- Clock can be seen through periodic expression (every 90 minutes in
chick embryos) of transcription factor hes1, where hes1 is initially expressed in the caudal half of the Unsegmented Mesoderm, with hes1 expression being inactivately caudally initially, moving rostrally.
- This means that over time, hes1 expression becomes localised to smaller, more rostral regions of the Unsegmented Mesoderm, eventually forming the boundary between the Unsegmented Mesoderm and where the somite is forming (hes1 is only eventually only expressed in the caudal region of the Somite)
- Each cycle of clock causes formation of 1 somite and FGF/WNT gradient causes them to form in an anterior-posterior series.
- Threshold concentration of FGF/WNT gradient determines whether hes1 can induce somite formation:
- Above FGF/WNT threshold (caudally), hes1 cannot induce somite formation
- Below FGF/WNT threshold (rostrally), hes1 can induce somite formation

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 20.26.59.png](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_20.26.59.png)

---

# Somite Development

- Somites are laid down progressively in an anterior-posterior direction and differentiate in the same order, with anterior somites being more differentiated than posterior somites at any point in time.
- Medial Cells of the somite close to notochord break away and form a migratory population called sclerotome which form the vertebrae, with remaining lateral parts of somite now known as dermomyotome.
- This subsequently divides into dermatome (closest to skin/laterally) and myotome (closest to neural tube/medially).
- Somitocoel is somite with fluid filled cavity with a few floating cells.
- Myotome (future muscle) can be divided into:
1. Epimere (epaxial myotome): dorsal layer which forms axial musculature.
2. Hypomere (hypaxial myotome): ventral layer which is migratory and forms muscles as limb musculature.

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 20.28.15.png](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_20.28.15.png)

---

# Patterning Somites

- Fate of somite cells is specified by signals released by surrounding tissues.
- SHH and Noggin (BMP inhibitor) from the notochord and floor plate, induce the somite cells closest to them to induce sclerotome (expressing Pax1).
- Remaining cells form dermomyotome (expressing Pax3).
- Wnt from dorsal neural tube, and low level SHH induce epaxial myotome (expressing Myf5).
- Wnt from dorsal epidermis and BMP from lateral plate mesoderm induce hypaxial myotome (expressing MyoD).
- NT3 from dorsal neural tube induces dermatome in the region of the somite between the Epaxial Myotome medially and the Hypaxial Myotome laterally, which forms the connective tissues of the skin (expresses Pax3).

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 20.28.58.png](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_20.28.58.png)

---

# Axial Development

- Sclerotome cells migrate around notochord and neural tube in response to SHH Signalling, forming axial skeleton (vertebrae and ribs).
- They are initially formed of cartilage, but this is soon replaced with bone via endochondral ossification.
- Dermatome separates from myotome and migrates dorsally around the inner surface of epidermis, forming connective tissue of skin (dermis).
- Dermis within the Limbs and the ventral side of the body wall are derived from Lateral Plate Mesoderm
- Myotome is composed of a dorsal epimere and a ventral hypomere, which form epaxial and hypaxial skeletal muscle respectively, found posterior and anterior to transverse process of the vertebrae respectively.

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 20.30.51.png](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_20.30.51.png)

---

# Vertebral Development

- Each sclerotome splits into rostral and caudal segments, with Von Ebner’s Fissure separating these segments, whilst its associated myotome from the same somite does not separate and is associated with both segments of the sclerotome.
- As spinal nerves grow toward rostral somite through Von Ebner’s Fissure (between the rostral and caudal sclerotome) to innervate the myotome from which the sclerotome it is passing through is derived, the rostral segment of each sclerotome recombines with caudal segment of the adjacent sclerotome found just rostral to form a vertebrae
- Therefore, each vertebrae is formed by the rostral segment of the associated sclerotome and the caudal segment of the sclerotome found just rostral to it
- This allows skeletal muscle cells to connect to 2, adjacent vertebrae (to allow for movement of individual vertebrae relative to one another).
- This is resegmentation.

---

# Intervertebral Discs

- When sclerotome splits into rostral and caudal segments, sclerotome cells remaining in plane of division (Von Ebner’s Fissure) coalesce to form the annulus fibrosus in the periphery of the intervertebral disc.
- Whilst signals from the Sclerotome that form the vertebrae cause the Notochord passing through the Vertebrae to degenerate, the Notochord segments in the Intervertebral regions do not receive these signals and hence, persist and form the Nucleus Pulposus of the Intervertebral Disc.
- Notochord cells enclosed by this sclerotome structure differentiate to form nucleus pulposus of disc.
- The nucleus pulposus is only remnant of notochord in the Adult.

---

# Fate of Myoblasts

- Dermomyotome splits into a dermatome and myotome, with latter subsequently splitting into dorsal (epimere) and ventral (hypomere) populations that differentiate skeletal muscles of back and chest/abdomen + limbs respectively.
- Dermal layer on belly is from lateral plate mesoderm.
- Dermal layer on back is from dermatome region of the somite.

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 20.34.50.png](%5B004%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Mammalian%20Development%20db47ad68633f45cc8224b1be7318c44a/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_20.34.50.png)

---

# Muscle Development

- Myoblasts are formed from the Epimere and are progenitor cells for skeletal muscle.
- They are induced in somites by signals from adjacent tissues (e.g. WNT from neural tube).
- Initially, FGF inhibits MyoD1 function (which normally inhibits Myoblast Proliferation) to stimulate the proliferation of Myoblasts via Mitosis. Eventually, FGF signalling is turned off to stop proliferation, to allow for differentiation of Myoblasts to occur
- These WNT signals then induce expression of myogenic factors, such as MyoD1, which causes the myoblasts line up adjacent to one another and fuse to form multinucleate myotubes, which then differentiate further to form skeletal muscle.

# Segmental Identity

- Sclerotome of somites form specific segments of axial skeleton, with rostral somites forming cervical vertebrae and caudal somites forming sacrum and coccyx.
- Each somite appears to know its final vertebral morphology in the adult spine as soon as it is formed, based on Wnt and FGF Concentrations down the rostral-caudal axis.

# Homebox (HOX) Genes

- Homebox genes were first identified in Drosophila, as mutations that transformed 1 segment into another.
- For example, Ultrabithorax mutations transform 3rd thoracic segment (halters - gyroscope) into a 2nd thoracic segment (wings), while Antennapedia GoF mutations transform antennae into legs in the head.
- There are 8 homeotic genes in Drosophila which determine segment identity/morphology.

### Transcription Factors

- Homebox genes are named after a highly conserved DNA sequence, called homebox, which encodes a sequence-specific DNA binding domain called homeodomain.
- Homebox is 180 bp long, producing a 60 amino acid protein.
- These proteins bind to DNA of regulatory regions (promoters or enhancers of target genes).
- Other parts of the protein are required to build transcription complexes that determine whether target genes are transcribed or not.
- Thus, homeodomain proteins are transcription factors.

# All Animals have HOX Genes

- Homebox genes have been found in most multicellular organisms, but not in bacteria.
- They are usually found in complexes (found close together within the Chromosome) containing multiple homebox genes (except plants).
- Most animals have only a single homebox complex/clusters but many vertebrates, including humans, have 4 closely related gene clusters containing 39 HOX Genes.

# Human HOX Genes

- Mammals, including humans, have 39 HOX genes grouped into 4 complexes HOXA-D, that arose through duplication events early in vertebrate evolution.
- HOXA-D are found on Chromosomes 7,17,12 and 2
- Ancestral complex may have had 11 genes, but 2 additional genes have been added (12 and 13) but each of 4 complexes have lost HOX genes so that HOXA-D do not contain all 13 HOX genes.
- As each somite is formed, it activates a different subtype of HOX genes.

### HOX Genes Specify Vertebral Fate

- HOX genes specify identity of vertebrae in a way that reflects their position within the HOX complexes, so that Upstream HOX Genes specify more cranial vertebrae and Downstream HOX Genes specify more caudal vertebrae.
- Whilst all HOX genes are expressed throughout the entirety of the developing vertebral column, they only induce specific vertebrae in the regions where their concentration is highest

| Gene | Spinal Region Specified |
| --- | --- |
| Hox5 | Cervical |
| Hox6-Hox9 | Thoracic |
| Hox10 | Lumbar |
| Hox 11-13 | Sacral and Caudal |

# HOX Mutations Change Vertebral Identity

- Hox genes are required to specify segmental identity in mice.
- Knockout of individual Hox10 genes (a, c or d) in all HOX Complexes has little effect on development of vertebrae, but knockout (loss-of function) of all 3 genes transforms lumbar vertebrae into rib bearing thoracic vertebrae.
- Gain of Hox10 function (normally highly expressed in Lumbar Vertebrae) in thorax transforms thoracic vertebrae into lumbar vertebrae, and hence loss of ribs.
- Sternum comes from lateral plate mesoderm migrating into middle and remains unaffected by HOX Mutations

# Cervical Rib

- 1 in 200 people are born with an extra rib attached to C7.
- Cervical ribs can cause a form of thoracic outlet syndrome due to compression of lower trunk of brachial plexus or subclavian artery.
- Extra ribs may also be found in lumbar region of axial skeleton from L1.
