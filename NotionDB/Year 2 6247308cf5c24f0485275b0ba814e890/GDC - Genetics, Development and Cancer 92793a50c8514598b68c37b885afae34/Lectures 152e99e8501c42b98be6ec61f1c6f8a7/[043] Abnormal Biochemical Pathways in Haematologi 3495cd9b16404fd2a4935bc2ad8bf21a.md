# [043] Abnormal Biochemical Pathways in Haematological Malignancies

# Case 1

- A 59-year-old man presents with a 2-month history of fever, night sweats and weight loss. On examination, he has an enlarged spleen and no other abnormal findings. Full blood count shows:

- Bone marrow examination confirms diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukaemia (Chronic as lots of Differentiated Cells and very few Undifferentiated Cells + Raised RBCs and Platelets).
- Cytogenetic (chromosomal) analysis of bone marrow reveals a translocation t(9;22) which is typical of CML (Philadelphia Chromosome).
- Treatment with Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Glivec) controls elevated WBC and brings it into normal range.
- Spleen shrinks, and patient feels symptomatically better.

### What Features Suggest That This Disease Originates in a Multipotential Progenitor/Stem Cell?

- High neutrophils, platelets and haemoglobin ‚Üí These are different cell lineages yet as they are all raised, this indicates a mutation within a common progenitor/stem cell that proliferates and later differentiated to form RBCs, Platelets and Neutrophils.
- BCR-ABL fusion gene is found in all haematopoietic cells due to its origin in a multipotent stem cell: neutrophils, red cell precursors, megakaryocytes (platelet precursors) ‚Üí Can be visualised by FISH by using 2 probes - Targetted against ABL gene and BCR gene which produces a single signal with a colour produced by a mixture of the 2 single colour probes due to the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene

### Treatment with Imatinib Results in an Excellent Clinical Response but Assessment of Residual Disease by a Highly Sensitive RT-PCR Test for BCR-ABL mRNA Transcripts Shows that a Low Level of Leukaemic Cells Persist. What Other Treatments May Be Useful?

- BCR-ABL is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that leads to
changes in cell function via the activation of multiple different intracellular pathways (E.g Ras and PI-3K Pathways):
1. ‚Üë proliferation
2. ‚Üì apoptosis
3. ‚Üë susceptibility to DNA damage (likely due to reduced response to Apoptosis allowing mutated cells to persist and accumulate additional mutations).
- Imatinib is a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor that binds to the ATP Binding Pocket of the BCR-ABL Tyrosine Kinase, preventing ATP from Binding (Competitive Inhibitor) which prevents the Tyrosine Kinase Domain of BCR-ABL from Phosphorylating its substrate and activating downstream signalling pathways, preventing the activation of proliferative TFs and hence, excessive cellular proliferation

**Why and how does Imatinib work in CML?**

1. Target (BCR-ABL) present in all tumour cells as it is the initial mutation seen in CML, allowing all tumour cells to be targeted/sensitive despite Potential Tumour Heterogeneity.
2. Effective pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile so it is safe.
3. Early-phase CML is a genetically uncomplicated tumour, with the initial genetic abnormality being BCR-ABL, which drives the accumulation of further mutations seen in CML.
4. Imatinib eliminates proliferative advantage of BCR-ABL expressing stem/progenitor cells.
5. Imatinib treatment reduces the likelihood of BCR-ABL expressing cells from acquiring further mutations that convert CML to a more aggressive leukaemia.
- For those who do not respond to imatinib, other treatment methods include:
1. Other kinase inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib).
2. Allogenic stem cell transplantation ‚Üí Transplantation of HSCs from a Tissue Matched Donor to replace Cancerous Stem Cells with Non-Transformed Stem Cells.
3. Antiproliferative cytokines (e.g. ùõº-interferon) to oppose the Proliferative effect of BCR-ABL.
- Discontinuation of imatinib leads to detectable relapse, as it only
inhibits BCR-ABL Activity and does not kill the cancer stem cells. Therefore, Discontinuation of Imatinib allows previously inhibited Cancerous Stem Cells to proliferate, causing relapse
- Therefore, A Px with CML needs to remain on TKIs for their entire life to prevent relapse and progression of CML
- Patient does not have any siblings and an unrelated donor stem
cell transplant is considered too risky.
- He is treated with imatinib for 2 years with good disease control.
- However, he re-presents with a short history of feeling unwell and
with nose-bleeds. Full blood count shows:

- Characteristic of AML as High WBC with Blast Cells vs Differentiated Cells (E.g Neutrophils) with Neutropaenia, Thrombocytopaenia and Erythropaenia (Pancytopaenia)

### What Do You Think Has Happened?

- There is a transformation of acute leukaemia with a block in differentiation, causing Haematopoetic Cells to persist as Undifferentiated Precursor Cells.
- There is a natural progression of CML to an acute leukaemia (85% AML but sometimes ALL as CML Stem Cells can differentiate down Myeloid or Lymphoid Pathways) due to Blast Transformation, as a result of cumulative mutations.
- This progression via the accumulation of mutations is most commonly seen in Epithelial Tumours (E.g Colorectal Cancer), where CML can be seen to be very similar to Hyperplastic Epithelium in the development of Invasive Carcinomas
- Advanced phase CML is much less responsive to imatinib, as there is:
1. BCR-ABL independent oncogenesis which allows Cancerous Cells to proliferate and progress regardless of whether BCR-ABL is active or not (All TKIs become ineffective).
2. Development of BCR-ABL Dependent Oncogenesis Pathways that are resistant to Imatinib due to Mutations in the ATP Binding Pocket of ABL so that Imatinib no longer binds here and hence, is not effective (Other TKIs like Dasatonib and Nilotinib can still be effective here)
- Treatment with an intensive course of cytotoxic therapy (daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside and thioguanine) fails to induce any significant response and he dies from uncontrolled pulmonary infection.

# Case 2 - Follicular Lymphoma

- A 65-year-old woman presents having noticed a lump in her neck.
- Examination reveals moderately enlarged lymph nodes in her
neck, axillae and inguinal regions.
- Lymph node biopsy establishes diagnosis of follicular non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma (B-cell).
- Further staging of disease shows presence of lymphoma cells in bone marrow as well as normal elements of haemopoiesis.
- Other than noticing presence of lymph nodes, she has no symptoms and her full blood count is entirely normal.
- Cytogenic analysis of lymphoma cells shows presence of a
chromosomal translocation t(14;18).
- In view of absence of symptoms, no specific treatment is given and she is reviewed regularly in outpatient clinic.
- No treatment is required for a further 4 years of follow-up.

### How Would You Describe The Rate of Progression of This Malignant Disease

- This is a slow growing, low-grade tumour.

### Can You Relate This to a Known Genetic Defect Found in Folicular NHL?

- Follicular non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphomas have increased levels of BCL-2 (BCL-2 on Chromosome 18 becomes regulated/under the control of the IgH Enhancer on Chromosome 14 when there is a Chromosome 14/18 Translocation, causing overexpression of BCL-2)
- BCL-2 is anti-apoptotic and decreases cell division so overexpression causes gradual accumulation of Cancerous B Cells (Leading to Slow Growth Rate and Low Cure Rates).
- Histologically, Cancerous B Cells within Lymph Nodes aggregate to form Follicles which are visible under biopsies

![Screenshot 2022-03-25 at 11.42.51.png](%5B043%5D%20Abnormal%20Biochemical%20Pathways%20in%20Haematologi%203495cd9b16404fd2a4935bc2ad8bf21a/Screenshot_2022-03-25_at_11.42.51.png)

- 4 years after her initial presentation, lymphadenopathy progresses
and is symptomatically uncomfortable.
- Treatment with chlorambucil, an oral cytotoxic agent is started.
- This results in regression of lymphadenopathy and symptomatic improvement.
- Intermittent courses of Chlorambucil are required over next 2 years to maintain disease control.

### Can you Come Up With Reasons Why Treatment With Intensive Multi-Agent Cytotoxics May Be Unlikely To Result In a Cure In Px with Follicular MHL?

- Cytotoxics work best in cycling cells that are actively synthesising DNA at a high rate as most Cytotoxic Drugs interfere with DNA Replication.
- Therefore, as BCL-2 Overexpression causes Cancerous Cells to replicate their DNA and proliferate at a slower rate, this means that Cytotoxics become less effective
- As Chemotherapy drugs usually interfere with DNA Replication, Causing DNA Damage that leads to Apoptosis so anti-apoptotic Action of BCL-2 means that Cells resist Chemotherapy-Mediated Apoptosis and persist, causing Chemotherapy to become less effective and less likely to produce a complete response/elimination of Cancerous Cells.
- Normally, in the Apoptotic Pathway, there is a balance between Pro-Apoptotic (E.g BAX and BAK), which interact with the Mitochondria to trigger Apoptosis, and Anti-Apoptotic Proteins (E.g BCL-2) which inhibit the activity of BAX and BAK - HERE
- Intracellular Damage and Oncogenes trigger the expression of BH3-Only Proteins which inhibit BCL-2 and other Anti-Apoptotic Proteins, casuing BAX and BAK Activity to increase to allow for Apoptosis to occur
- There are new drugs that target apoptosis directly, including BH3 mimetics (BCL-2 Inhibitors) which are small molecules that inhibit BCL-2 to increase the activity of Pro-Apoptotic Proteins like BAX and BAK to promote Apoptosis and counter the Anti-Apoptotic Effects of BCL-2 Overexpression.
- After 2 years of disease control, there is rapid ‚Üë in lymphadenopathy, development of constitutional symptoms (night sweats, weight loss).
- Repeat biopsy of a lymph node indicates disease progression to a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma where B Cells are no longer found organised into follicles but found diffuse throughout the Lymph Node.
- This transformation from Follicular B Cell Lymphoma to Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma is sometimes associated with further genetic changes in tumour such as loss of p53.

### p53

- p53 is activated by DNA Damage and induces the transcription of Cell cycle inhibitory Genes (E.g p21), DNA-Repair Genes (E.g GADD45) and Pro-Apoptotic Genes (E.g Bax, Puma and Noxa) to prevent proliferation of Mutated Cells
- Therefore, Mutations/Loss of p53 causes cells to become resistant to apoptosis and hence, to cytotoxic drugs, allowing these cells to proliferate to cause progression of the tumour

# Case 3 - Burkitt Lymphoma

- An 18-year-old man presents with weight loss and night sweats.
- Examination shows presence of a large abdominal mass which on biopsy is diagnosed as Burkitt lymphoma.
- There is extensive intra- abdominal lymphadenopathy found on CT scanning.
- Further staging investigations show that bone marrow is also involved with lymphoma and that characteristic cytogenetic abnormality t(8;14) is present in tumour cells.

### Would You Expect Growth Fraction of This Tumour To Be High or Low and Why?

- There is translocation of MYC from Chromosome 8 to downstream of promoter regions of IgH on chromosome 14.
- Burkitt‚Äôs Lymphoma is characterised by MYC Translocation most commonly to Chr 14, but in some cases, it can be translocated to Chromosome 22 and 2 where they become regulated by the promoter of IgŒª and IgŒ∫ respectively ‚Üí These all cause upregulation of Myc expression
- There is a high growth fraction approaching 100% (Very High Proliferation Rate) as c-myc increases the transcription of growth and cell-cycle promoting genes, driving cell proliferation.
- This high growth fraction/proliferation rate can be indicates histologically as when cells are moving through the cell cycle and hence, proliferating, they produce large amounts of Ki-67.
- Therefore, mAb vs Ki-67 can be used to stain cells to indicate [Ki-67] to identify the number of cells undergoing mitosis and their proliferation rate (allowing for the identification of Cancer Cells)
- In Follicular Lymphoma, cells do not have a high rate of proliferation as Oncogenesis is driven by reduced Apoptosis of Mutated Cells instead of Increased proliferation, causing few cells to stain with mAb vs Ki-67
- In Burkitt‚Äôs Lymphoma, cells have an extremely high proliferation rate so many cells stain intensely for Ki-67

![Screenshot 2022-03-25 at 14.26.22.png](%5B043%5D%20Abnormal%20Biochemical%20Pathways%20in%20Haematologi%203495cd9b16404fd2a4935bc2ad8bf21a/Screenshot_2022-03-25_at_14.26.22.png)

### Can You Predict How The Clinical Course In This Px Would Compare With a Px with Follicular Lymphoma With a Translocation Involving Bcl-2?

- Burkitt type lymphoma have dysregulated c-myc and high
proliferation fraction and high cure rates.
- C-Myc is involved in regulating a large number of genes, mainly those involved in Proliferation via Cell Cycle Regulation and Metabolism
- Cure rates with intensive chemotherapy is roughly 80-90% for Px <60 as cytotoxic drugs are more effective in cells that are proliferating rapidly so as Burkitt‚Äôs Lymphoma has a high proliferation rate, these cells can be targeted by Chemotherapy to Rx the Cancer.
- Treatment consisting of several cycles of multiagent cytotoxic
therapy is given and at end of this there is no evidence of residual
disease (complete remission).
- He is followed-up for 5 years and shows no evidence of relapse and is considered cured.
- Therefore, whilst its rapid growth means that without intervention, it can rapidly progress and be fatal, its rapid growth means that it can be targeted easily by Chemotherapy Agents and hence, is easily cured
- However, Follicular Lymphoma‚Äôs slow growth means that it is slow progressing and is not rapidly fatal but its slow growth rate means that it cannot be effectively targeted by Chemotherapy

# Case 4

- 27-year-old woman presenting with fatigue and bruising.

![Screenshot 2022-03-23 at 18.01.10.png](%5B043%5D%20Abnormal%20Biochemical%20Pathways%20in%20Haematologi%203495cd9b16404fd2a4935bc2ad8bf21a/Screenshot_2022-03-23_at_18.01.10.png)

- Bone marrow shows presence of large numbers of abnormal
promyelocytes (neutrophil precursors) but very few mature neutrophils (causing Pancytopaenia).
- Megakaryocytes (platelet precursors) are ‚Üì.
- Diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia is made (promyelocytic subtype,M3).
- Typical chromosomal translocation t(15;17) is identified on cytogenetic analysis and treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and cytotoxic agents started.
- The First Histologically recognisable cell in the Neutrophil Differentiation Pathway is the Promyelocyte as Myeloid and Lymphoid Blast Cells look almost identical
- In Promyelocytic Leukaemia, Cells are arrested at Promyelocytes, causing a large number of Promyelocytes to be found on Blood Smears

![Screenshot 2022-03-25 at 14.37.25.png](%5B043%5D%20Abnormal%20Biochemical%20Pathways%20in%20Haematologi%203495cd9b16404fd2a4935bc2ad8bf21a/Screenshot_2022-03-25_at_14.37.25.png)

### What Are 2 Genes Involved in the Translocation t(15;17). What Effect Does Rx with Retinoic Acid (ATRA) Have on Differentiation in Leukaemic Cells?

- PML-RARùõº protein which is formed as a result of t(15;17) inhibits normal action of retinoic acid and blocks gene transcription and differentiation in neutrophils ‚Üí This fusion gene is Pathognomonic of APL.
- When Retinoic Acid is not present, the RAR binds to the RAR Binding Site just upstream of the Target gene which it regulates and also binds Transcription Repressor Complex HDAC to prevent Target Gene transcription
- When Endogenous Retinoids are bound to RAR at the RAR Binding Site, The RAR can no longer bind the Transcription Repressor Complex HDAC, allowing for the Target Gene to be transcribed and expressed
- In Myeloid Cells, these target genes are invovled in Neutrophil Development/Differentiation
- In Acute Promyelocytic Anaemia, the RARùõº Region that binds to the RAR Binding Site is translocated to the PML Gene to form the PML-RARùõº Fusion Gene
- PML Binds to RARùõº with a Higher Affinity than Retinoic Acid, meaning Retinoic Acid is unable to bind to the RAR to allow for Target Genes to be expressed
- This means that the Transcription Repressor Complex is constitutively recruited by the PML-RARùõº Complex, causing Genes driving Neutrophil Development to be constitutively silence, preventing Neutrophil Differentiation which causes cells to accumulate as Promyelocytes

![Screenshot 2022-03-25 at 14.40.53.png](%5B043%5D%20Abnormal%20Biochemical%20Pathways%20in%20Haematologi%203495cd9b16404fd2a4935bc2ad8bf21a/Screenshot_2022-03-25_at_14.40.53.png)

- Treatment with high doses of retinoic acid relieves inhibition of PML-RARùõº as the Retinoic Acid outcompetes PML (despite PML‚Äôs Higher Affinity), allowing the Transcription Repressor Complex HDAC to be displaced, allowing for Promyelocytes to continue their differentiation to form Neutrophils
- As Neutrophils have a limited Lifespan whereas Promyelocytes do not, this allows for Cancerous Neutrophils containing the PML-RARùõº Fusion Gene to undergo Apoptosis to effectively Rx the Cancer
- In Some Cases, Soon after Rx with Retinoic Acid, The Differentiation of Large Numbers of Promyelocytes into Neutrophils within Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia Tumours causes the formation of Pus around the Tumours due to the Large Numbers of Neutrophils now present
- Patient enters complete remission after 1 course of ATRA/cytotoxics and receives a further 3 courses to consolidate response.
- After completion of therapy, she is followed up in clinic with 3-monthly bone marrow sampling to look for relapse by microscopy and measurement of presence of any t(15;17) fusion gene mRNA transcript by PCR technique.
- Both microscopy and PCR are -ve at completion of therapy.
- At her 6-month follow up visit, microscopy is normal, but PCR is now +ve.

### Can You Think Of An Explanation For This Finding?

- As RT-PCR is more sensitive than microscopy at picking up minimal disease so following Rx, there was some Cancerous Cells that remained in such a low number that they could not be identified by PCR or Microscopy at that time.
- Over time, these Cancerous Cells proliferated to reach a number where they could now be detected by RT-PCR, indicating Leukaemia Relapse
- This technique allows detection of 1 abnormal RNA copy in 10,000 normal ones.
- Detection of molecular relapse prior to development of clinical
disease and Sx via RT-PCR allows for the introduction of salvage treatment at a time when patient is in better physical condition to Rx cancer before it relapses significantly to cause Sx.
