# [027] Sex Determination and Development of the Reproductive Tracts

# Human Sexual Development

- Primary sex is determined at fertilisation by sex chromosome carried by sperm (X or Y from the Mother and Father respectively) that fertilises the egg.
- Male specified by Y chromosome and female by X chromosome (absence of the Y Chromosome).
- Early embryo (first 2 months) is sexual indifferent and capable of
forming both male and female anatomy irrespective of the sex chromosome genotype that it possesses.
- At the end of 2 months, the Gonads begin to differentiate as testis (XY) or ovary (XX).
- Gonads release hormones (testosterone, AMH, oestrogens) that
trigger differentiation of male or female reproductive tracts and
genitalia (secondary sex determination)
- Hormonal surge at puberty drive appearance of adult sexual characteristics.

### Primary Sex Development

| XO | Female |
| --- | --- |
| XX | Female |
| XXX | Female |
| XY | Male |
| XXY | Male |
| XXXY | Male |

- XO = Turner’s Syndrome
- XXX = Triple X Syndrome
- XXY = Klinefelter’s Syndrome
- XXXY = Similar to Klinefelter’s Syndrome
- In Insects, XX = Female and XO = Male (Y Chromosome has no role in Male Sex Determination as it is entirely determined by the X Chromosome)
- Therefore, in males, the presence of a Y Chromosome, regardless of X Genotype → Male and the absence of a Y Chromosome = Female

# Turner Syndrome

- Affects in between 1 in 2,000 and 1 in 5,000 female births, with
symptoms that include a short and webbed neck, low hairline at
back of neck, short stature, swollen hands and feet, heart defects,
diabetes and low thyroid hormone.
- These females are typically infertile and only develop menstrual periods and breasts with hormone treatment as their ovaries do not develop properly in utero, meaning there is poor development of Secondary Sexual Characteristics.
- Cells of normal females inactivate 1 of their X chromosomes by hypercondensing the Chromosome to form a Barr body (Very Small circular nuclear body found at the periphery of the Nucleus).
- Despite individuals with Turner Syndrome being Phenotypically Female (as they do not contain a Y Chromosome), they are hemizygous for the X Chromosome, having the same X Chromosome gene dosage as a normal male and hence, do not form a Barr Body
- The Number of Barr Bodies found in the Nucleus = (Number of X Chromosomes) - 1 - This is to ensure that only 1 X Chromosome is active within the cell to prevent detrimental effects of increased X Chromosome Gene Dosage on the Cell

# Human Y Chromosome

- It is shortest Chromosome in the Human Genome and its primarily role is determination of Sex (Presence = Male and Absence = Female)
- Has 59 million base pairs and 50 protein coding genes (it also contains other genes coding for RNA).
- It has evolved for the shrinkage and loss of genes from X chromosome whilst accumulating genes from other Chromosomes that are needed for Spermatogenesis including azoospermia factors (AZF) as these factors are not required in females.
- Most genes are unique to Y chromosome but 30 genes have corresponding genes on X chromosome.
- Pseudoautosomal regions (PAR) (found on tips of the p and q arms of the chromosome) contain these genes shared with X chromosomes.
- During Meiosis, it is possible for the X and Y Chromosomes to pair together due to common genes in the PAR of the X and Y Chromosomes, with pairing occurring at these regions
- During Recombination in Meiosis, there is normally some exchange of DNA between the PAR Regions of the X and Y Chromosomes but sometimes, this can extend to regions found more proximal than the PAR to include the exchange of genes from the Y Chromosome that are not found on the X Chromosome (Notably SRY) which can cause abnormalities in sex determination
- The short (p) arm contains SRY gene, just proximal to the PAR Region, which specifies testis development and therefore male sex.
- It doesn’t matter if SRY is found on the X or Y chromosome following recombination as presence of the SRY gene ensures male development.

### Sex Determining Region of Y Chromosome

- SRY is a transcription factor belonging to SOX (SRY-like box) family
of DNA binding proteins.
- Mutations in this gene cause XY gonadal dysgenesis (Swyer
syndrome) whereby testes are not formed, causing the child to be anatomically female but lacks functional ovaries, failing to undergo puberty without hormone therapy.
- A Y Chromosome that has an SRY Deletion is unable to specify testes and hence, the male sex whereas an X Chromosome with an SRY Insertion will specify testes and hence, the male sex (although the males will not be fertily
- SRY is believed to have evolved from SOX3 (important for development of nervous system), a gene locate on X chromosome.

---

# Genetics of Sex Determination

- Following the formation of the Genital Ridge (Week 8), it can either form the Testes or the Ovaries
- In the Male Embryo (XY), SRY is expressed in the developing Gonads for a short duration, activating the transcription of SOX9, which initiates and drives the development of the testes by stimulating the production of other genes required for testes development (FGF9, Ptgds and Sox8)
- SOX 9 maintains its own expression via inhibition of β-catenin (which normally inhibits Sox9 expression) within the developing Genital Ridge throughout the rest of development and inhibits genes that promote ovary development (E.g FOXL2)
- Testicular Development within the male embryo is driven by Sox9 and Sox8
- In the Female Gonads, the absence of SRY means that Wnt4 signalling stimulates the expression of β-catenin (stimulates ovarian development), which inhibits Sox9 expression to inhibit male development
- In the developing ovary, the lack of Sox9 expression means that FoxL2 is expressed , which maintains ovarian cells within the foetus and adult by suppressing Sox9 and Sox8 to prevent testicular cells from developing in the Ovary during foetal development and adulthood
- Sox9 is continuously repressed throughout Ovarian Development to suppress Testes Development to ensure that Ovary development occurs
- Dmrt1 drives testicular development by increasing/maintaining the expression of Sox9 + Sox8 directly and indirectly by suppressing the expression of FoxL2 (which now allows testicular cells to begin to form within the developing ovary)

### Sex Determination

- Testis forms Sertoli cells (secretes anti-Mullerian hormone/AMH) and Leydig cells (secretes testosterone).
- AMH represses development of female reproductive tract, while testosterone promotes development of male reproductive tract.
- Ovary forms thecal cells (secretes androgens - Not used to drive Testosterone production unlike in males) and granulosa cells (takes up androgens produced by thecal cells).
- Granulosa cells secrete oestrogen directly and indirectly by converting androgens from Thecal Cells into oestrogens that promote development of female characteristics.

# Testes Are Required For Male Development

- Alfred Jost (1916-1991) removed gonads (ovary and testes) from rabbit embryos and found that they were all born female, even XY individuals.
- Demonstrates that testes produce hormones that direct male
development.
- Jost also discovered activity of anti-Mullerian hormone.

# Secondary Sex Determination

- Determination of sex-specific body parts, as driven by Gonadal Hormones vs Genes:
1. Male characteristics: penis, scrotum, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, high muscle mass, facial hair, deep voice.
2. Female characteristics: clitoris, vagina, uterus, oviducts, breasts, low muscle mass, little facial hair, high voice.
- Male characteristics: form when testes secrete testosterone.
- Female characteristics: form in absence of testosterone alongside oestrogen signalling, regardless of genotype (XX or XY).

---

# Primordial Germ Cells

- They are the common origin of both sperm and egg.
- They are not formed in the same place as the gonads within the Embryo, but rather, in the Caudal Epiblast, caudal to the Primitive Streak during Gastrulation alongside extraembryonic mesoderm
- They migrate rostrally from epiblast to yolk sac wall (week 2-3) within the Umbilicus.
- Then, they migrate through umbilicus (associated with the Allantois) and along the dorsal mesentery of the hindgut, just deep to the Ventral Body Wall, and then that of the midgut (week 4).
- Finally, they arrive and populate the gonadal ridges found between the Forelimb rostrally and Hindlimb caudally, the presumptive gonads (weeks 5-6) to form germ cells.
- If they fail to reach the gonadal ridges then gonads do not develop (fetus becomes female as lack of gonadal hormone production means that female phenotype is formed - No stimulation of male development and suppression of female development by Testosterone in Males).

### Formation of Gonads

- The Gonadal ridge forms the somatic cells of gonad within the Intermediate Mesoderm, just ventral to the Mesonephric Duct, which proliferates to form primitive sex cords within the ridge.
- At this stage, both sexes have mesonephric (Wolffian) and Mullerian (paramesonephric ducts - found parallel and closely associated/lateral with the mesonephric duct).

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 08.36.45.png](%5B027%5D%20Sex%20Determination%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20Rep%20627289e0add14ef5969e391a98c0a7bb/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_08.36.45.png)

# Gonadal Development

### Male

- In the Presence of SRY, Sex cords grow into the Gonadal Ridge to form form testis cords, which in turn form seminiferous tubules (comprised of Sertoli cells) which connect to and become continuous with Mesonephric Tubules to connect the Seminiferous Tubules with the Epididymis and Vas Deferens
- Sertoli Cells produce anti-Mullerian hormone (found in high [ ] in the Male Foetal Circulation) causing the degeneration of Mullerian duct via Apoptosis to prevent development of the female reproductive tract.
- Mesenchyme of the Gonadal Ridge forms Leydig cells responsible for the production of testosterone, which maintains and remodels the mesonephric duct to form the vas deferens and epididymis.
- Within the Foetus, Testes Cords do not differentiate to form Germ Cells, with this differentiation to form Germ Cells occurring at Puberty, when Meiosis begins

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 08.47.24.png](%5B027%5D%20Sex%20Determination%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20Rep%20627289e0add14ef5969e391a98c0a7bb/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_08.47.24.png)

### Females

- Cortical Sex cords remain in the cortex of the Gonadal Ridge to form ovarian cords, which in turn form Oocytes and surrounding granulosa cells that support the oocytes and secrete oestrogen.
- Unlike the Testes Cords, the Ovarian Cords are not very elongated (form isolated/discrete tissue masses) and do not become continuous with the Mesonephric Tubules
- Mesenchyme of the Gonadal Ridge forms Thecal cells that secrete androgens, converted to oestrogen by granulosa cells.
- Due to the lack of AMH production (Due to there being no Sertoli Cells), the Mullerian Duct persists to form the Oviduct whilst the lack of Testosterone Production (due to there being no Leydig Cells) causes the Mesonephric Duct to degenerate, meaning the Ovary only remains attached to the Uterus via the Suspensory Ligament of the Ovary
- Meiosis (germ cells) begins in foetus as the Oocytes are produced In Utero from Germline Cells, but Meiosis only proceeds to prophase I.

# Testicular Descent

- Once the Testes and Ovaries have formed in both sexes, they both descend in the abdominal cavity, but the descent of the Testes is much greater than that of the ovaries
- Primitive gonad is located near kidney, attached to the Diaphragm rostrally by the cranial suspensory ligament (CSL) and to the Caudal abdominal wall by the gubernaculum - Transabdominal Phase of Testicular Descent (7-12 weeks).
- As Development Progresses, the Cranial Suspensory Ligament degenerates whilst the Gubernaculum contracts to pull the Primitive Gonads inferiorly towards the Caudal Abdominal Wall
- From the 7th Month, the Gubernaculum pulls the Testes more caudally than the Ovaries (which remain at the level of the Caudal Abdominal Wall) so that the Testes pass through the Inguinal Canal to enter the Scrotum (Inguinoscrotal Phase of Testicular Descent → Not found in the Females)
- Within the Scrotum, the Gubernaculum attaches the Testes to the Inner Surface of the Inferior Scrotum but this is a minor attachment as the Testes are still able to freely move in the Scrotum
- In 97% of cases, this has occurred by birth, in most of remaining 3%, will occur within a year of birth.
- Cryptorchidism: failure of testis to descend into the scrotum.
- In Cryptorchidism, there can be subfertility/infertility as for spermatogenesis to occur effectively, the Testes must be at a lower temperature than the rest of the body. Therefore, when the Testes persist within the Abdomen/Pelvis, they are at a higher temperature, meaning the rate and efficiency of spermatogenesis decreases

# Uterus and Vagina

- Traditional view (presented here) is that caudal ends of Mullerian ducts fuse to form uterus (Uterine Cavity), cervix and upper 1/3 of vagina.
- The rostral ends of the Mullerian Duct do not fuse and remain open to form the Uterine Tubes
- Lower 2/3rds is made of endoderm (Urogenital Sinus) that will also form the urinary bladder.
- More recent evidence suggests that whole of vagina may be made by Mullerian duct as if Endoderm does initially form the lower 2/3rds of the Vagina, it is rapidly replaced by cells from the Mullerian Duct

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 08.39.17.png](%5B027%5D%20Sex%20Determination%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20Rep%20627289e0add14ef5969e391a98c0a7bb/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_08.39.17.png)

### Uterine Defects

- Uterine Defects can occur due to improper or lack of fusion of the Mullerian Ducts to form the Uterus and Vagina:
1. Double Uterus and Vagina - No fusion of the Mullerian Ducts so each forms its own Uterus and Vagina
2. Double Uterus - Fusion of the Caudal Mullerian Ducts but not of the Rostral Mullerian Ducts so that a Single Vagina but 2 Uteruses are formed
3. Bicornate Uterus - Fusion of the Caudal Mullerian Ducts and the Lower aspect of the Rostral Mullerian Ducts to form a single Caudal Vagina which opens up into 2 Rostral Uteruses
4. Septated Uterus (Most Common Uterine Defect) - Failure of the Uterine Septum (Medial walls of the Mullerian Tube) to degenerate, causing a Midline Septum to persist within the uterus which separates it into right and left halves
5. Unicornate Uterus - Only one Mullerian Tube forms the Uterus so there is a single/smaller Uterine Cavity connected to the Vagina
6. Cervical Atresia - Failure of formation of the Cervical Canal so the Uterine Lumen becomes disconnected from the Vagina, causing Infertility
- 1% of fertile population and 3% of women with repeated miscarriages have Uterine Defects
- This leads to ↓ fertility (to a varying degree depending on the specific abnormality) and dystocia (difficult/abnormal labour).

# Development of Genitalia - Week 7

- The Development of Male or Female Genitalia is dependent on the Presence or Absence of Dihydrotestosterone (Drives Male and Female Development Respectively), formed from Testosterone within the Male Gonads
- Testosterone itself is not potent enough to drive the Development of the Male External Genitalia so without Dihydrotestosterone, Female External Genitalia are formed (alongside Oestrogen Signalling)
- At the Beginning of Week 7, Genitalia is capable of Forming either Male or Female External Genitalia, comprised of a Ventral Genital Tubercle and a Dorsal Anus, with the space between these spanned by Medial Urogenital Folds and a lateral Labioscrotal Folds
- In the absence of Dihydrotestosterone and Oestrogens, the Genitalia remain at the Bipotential Intermediate Phase seen before the development of the Male and Female External Genitalia

### Male

- Urogenital folds fuse (closing the gap between them to form the Distal Aspect of the Penile/Spongy Urethra) and genital tubercle elongates ventrally to form the Glans of the Penis.
- Invagination of ectoderm covering glans and degeneration of the Cells at the centre of the Genital Tubercle/Glans of the Penis of the  forms distal urethra.
- Labioscrotal folds enlarge to form the scrotum.

### Female

- Genital tubercle bends inferiorly to form the clitoris.
- Urogenital folds remain separated to form labia minora.
- Labioscrotal folds form labia majora.

# Disorders of Sex Development

- Previously known as hermaphroditism, pseudohermaphroditism,
intersex and sex reversal.
- May affect 0.5% of newborn infants.
- 80% of infants with DSD have XY karyotype/male (46, XY DSD) and most of these (75% of infants with DSD) have hypospadias.
- 10-15% of infants with DSD have XX karyotype/female (46, XX DSD) with over 90% being caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

### Hypospadias

- 1 in 300 births.
- Fusion of urethral folds is incomplete at its caudal end so their urethra opens along the inferior/dorsal aspect of penis, either near glans (most common), along shaft (most rare) or near base of penis.
- This can be easily corrected by surgery

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 08.41.51.png](%5B027%5D%20Sex%20Determination%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20Rep%20627289e0add14ef5969e391a98c0a7bb/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_08.41.51.png)

### Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome

- XY/Males individuals contain testes that produce testosterone, but
the foetus is insensitive to hormone due to mutations in the Cytoplasmic Androgen Receptor gene.
- Complete form (AR is completely inactive) produces tall, thin females with breasts, external genitalia and vagina, but not uterus or oviduct as they produce anti-Mullerian hormone which causes degeneration of the Mullerian Duct, preventing the formation of the Cervix and Uterus.
- Excess Testosterone is instead metabolised into Oestrogens to help drive female development (e.g Breasts and External Genitalia)
- Partial form (AR has low activity) produces various grades of feminisation so that anatomy is usually seen consisting of a mixture of male and female characteristics.
- It always affects genitalia (can cause Seuxally Ambiguous Genitalia) and secondary sexual characteristics as these are driven by Gonadal Steroid Signalling.
- Mild form produces male (commonly with Hypospasia) with impaired spermatogenesis and/or secondary sexual characteristics but does not affect genitalia.

---

# Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

- Most common cause of ambiguous genitalia due to prenatal
virilisation/masculinisation of genetically female (XX) foetus.
- Typical frequency is 1 in 15,000, but may be much higher (e.g. 1 in 400) in some populations.
- Caused by autosomal recessive mutations in genes encoding
enzymes involved in synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone,
causing Cortisol and Aldosterone precursors (Pregnenolone and 17-OH Pregnenolone) to accumulate and be redirected down Adrenal Androgen Synthesis vs Cortisol/Aldosterone, increasing DHEA Synthesis, which in turn increases Testosterone Synthesis (Causing Increased Masculinisation of Female Genitalia/Virilisation).
- 90-95% of cases caused by mutations in CYP21A gene, which
encodes 21-𝛼hydroxylase (prevent conversion of Progesterone to Dehydroxycortisone to prevent Aldosterone Synthesis and 17-OH Progesterone to 11-Deoxycortisol to prevent Cortisol Synthesis), and 5% of cases caused by mutations in CYP11B1 gene, which encodes 11𝛽-hydroxylase (Prevents conversion of Corticosterone to Aldosterone and 11-Deoxycortisol to Cortisol).

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 08.43.02.png](%5B027%5D%20Sex%20Determination%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20Rep%20627289e0add14ef5969e391a98c0a7bb/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_08.43.02.png)

- Affects 1 in 18,000 infants in UK.

### Females

- Ambiguous genitalia (Contain features of Male and Female Genitalia) with an enlarged clitoris and a common urogenital sinus in place of a separate urethra and vagina.
- Internal female organs (Ovaries, Uterus and Vagina) are normal.
- In most severe form, aldosterone deficiency leads to loss of salt.

### Male

- No signs at birth, except subtle hyperpigmentation and possible penile enlargement.
- Salt losing form typically present at 7-14 days of life with vomiting, weight loss, lethargy, dehydration, hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia.
- Mild virilisation at age 2-4 years.

### 5α-Reductase Deficiency

- Homozygous for mutation in 5α-reductase gene (SRD5A2), which encodes enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT).
- This is commonly found in isolated/small communities around the world, like the Dominican Republic
- DHT is a more potent version of testosterone that is required for development of male genitalia so inability to convert Bipotential Genitalia into normal male genitalia in the foetus, causing Infants to be born with Indifferent Genitalia.
- 46XY children that have testes and associated tubes but not male external genitalia so their external genitalia resembles that of girls so these babies are raised as girls.
- At puberty, testes produce increased amounts of testosterone which drives the development of male genitalia (usually smaller than that seen in Normal Males) and secondary sex characteristics so that females apparently turn into Men.
- Adults have little facial hair, never develop acne, have small prostate, and do not go bald.
- As Dihydrotestosterone therefore drives enlargement of the prostate, 5α-Reductase inhibitors to control size of prostrate gland to prevent Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.

# Dihydrotestosterone

- 5α-Reductase converts Testosterone into 5-alpha-Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the Gonads, Hair Follicles and Prostate predominantly
- DHT is 3 times more potent than Testosterone.
- It is essential for development of male genitalia during foetal development and is responsible for male pattern baldness in adults when produced in excess within Male Hair Follicles.
- It is involved in prostate hyperplasia/cancer due to overproduction of DHT in the Prostate

# Summary

- In most mammals (all placental mammals), sex is determined by presence or absence of a Y chromosome with XX (female) and XY (male).
- Y chromosome possesses a single male determining gene, called
sex determining region of Y chromosome (SRY).
- SRY is a DNA binding protein that activates genetic program for
testis development and suppresses genetic programme for
ovarian development.
- Testes produce male hormones that promote development of
male characteristics (testosterone) and repress development of
female characteristics (AMH).
- Female characteristics develop in absence of male hormones in the presence of female hormones.
- Male and female genitalia form from same indifferent foetal structure, such that ambiguous genitalia can form with low levels
of testosterone.
