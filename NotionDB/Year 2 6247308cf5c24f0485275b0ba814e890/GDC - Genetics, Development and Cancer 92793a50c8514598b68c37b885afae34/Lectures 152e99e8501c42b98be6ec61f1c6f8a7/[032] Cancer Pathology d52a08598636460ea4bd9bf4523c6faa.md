# [032] Cancer Pathology

# Histopathologists and Definitions

- Different types of tumours within the same organ have different prognosis (E.g In the Testes, Classical Seminoma has a very good prognosis and can be Rx using Surgery Alone whereas other types of Testicular Cancers like Embryonic Carcinoma or Choriocarcinoma often require Chemotherapy alognside Surgery as they are more aggressive)

### Histopathologists

- Pathologists in the Rx of Cancer are important as they:
1. Biopsy tumours to determine whether the mass is benign (E.g from Inflammation) or malignant and what type of cancer is present, which can be used to determine the most efficacious treatment plan
2. Following Surgical Intervention, Histopathologists determine the completeness of Surgical Rx and hence, determine whether additional treatment like Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy are required to complete Rx
- Cytopathologists are specialised in the cytology (Appearance) of cells but not their architecture/organisation within the Wider Tissue/Tumour Itself, often analysing samples collected from Fluid (E.g Blood or Pleural Fluid) or FNA → This can be used to identify Malignant Cells but cannot be used to identify Invasion or Potential Metastasis (But Metastasis or Invasion can be inferred if the Malignant Cells are present in a location where they should not be found normally)

### Definitions

- Tumour: swelling of any sort.
- Cancer: all malignant neoplasms.
- Hypertrophy: ↑ in size of cells within an organ in response to a stimulus so that when the stimulus is removed, the cells return to their normal size.
- Physiological Example: exercising muscle; left ventricular hypertrophy in response to hypertension.
- Hyperplasia: ↑ in number of cells within an organ in response to a stimulus so that when the stimulus is removed, the number of cells return to normal
- Example: physiological hyperplasia of the breasts in puberty and lactation and pathological hyperplasia of the Prostate (e.g BPH due to DHT, which can regress following adminsitration of 5α-Reductase Inhibitors).
- Metaplasia: replacement of one differentiated cell type with another mature differentiated cell type that is not normally present in a specific tissue.
- It is usually in response to environmental stimuli and is usually (but not always) a pre-cancerous change
- Reversible - Example: Barrett’s oesophagus (non-keratinising squamous epithelium → columnar epithelium which usually lines the stomach due to acid reflux into the Oesophagus) → Precursor for Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma
- Example - Squamous Metaplasia in Lung and Cervix (Environmental Damaging Stimuli or Acidic Conditions within the Vagina can cause Columnar Epithelium within the Trachea/Bronchioles and Cervix to become Squamous respectively) → These can be precursors for Squamous Cell Carcinomas.
- Atrophy: ↓ in size of cells or number of cells within an organ. This can be reversible when it represents part of a response to an external stimulus (E.g Part of Homeostatic Response to Hypertrophy or Hyperplasia) or it can be part of the normal aging process.
- Neoplasm: new growth/tumour → Can be benign or malignant (Including Dysplasia and Carcinoma In Situ).
- An abnormal mass of tissue, where the growth of which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of the adjacent normal tissue.
- The mass persists in the same excessive manner after cessation of the stimuli (Unlike Hyperplasia that regresses following the removal of the stimulus).
- Neoplasia is characterised by disturbances in:
1. Cell Proliferation without the need for normal growth factors (E.g GoF Mutations in Growth Factor Receptors, leading to Constitutive Growth Signalling, E.g via TSG Mutations like Rb or p53 Mutations)
2. Cell Differentiation (Benign Masses = Well-Differentiated which resemble the normal morphology of the cell from which they are derived whereas Malignant Masses can range from Well to Poorly Differentiated/Anaplastic)
3. Relationship between the Tumour Cells and their surrounding Stroma (Benign Masses do not metastasise and remain localised to their site of origin as their migration is restricted by CT Capsules or compressed fibrous tissues whereas Malignant Masses infiltrate into the surrounding stroma where it can cause reactive changes such as Desmoplasia - Increased CT production - or Inflammation)
- Dysplasia: disordered growth.
- This is a pre-malignant change in cells (usually epithelium) characterised by disordered growth and morphological changes in the nucleus
- These cells remain in their normal location (do not metastasise) but have similar morphological appearances to malignant cells and hence, are classed as pre-malignant
- The nuclear changes are similar to those seen in neoplasms and include crowded and overlapping nuclei; large and irregular nuclei; uneven chromatin distribution; and ↑ mitotic activity.
- Carcinoma in situ: when dysplastic changes are marked and
involve the full thickness of the epithelium (causing cells to be very similar in morphology to malignant cells), but the lesion does not
penetrate the basement membrane and hence, is non-malignant
- It is considered a pre-invasive neoplasm and is referred to as carcinoma in situ and occipies an intermediate position between Dysplasia and Infiltrating Carcinoma.
- When considering Degrees of Dysplasia, as the Degree of Dysplasia increases, the staining intensity of more apical layers of Stratified Epithelium will increase and these more apical layers will appear significantly more granular, with disorganised and irregularly shaped nuclei
- Normally, The Basal Layer of Cervical Epithelium stains darkest, with more apical layers staining lighter (as Nuclei become smaller so Nucleus:Cytoplasm decreases) and having more artefacts
- Cervical Neoplasia is characterised based on the proportion of the width of the Cervical Epithelium where Neoplasic Changes can be seen (E.g If changes are seen in Basal 1/3rd, 2/3rds or Entirety of Epithelium → Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplsia 1,2 and 3/CN1,2 and 3 indicative of Low Grade Dysplasia, Moderate Dysplasia and Carcinoma In Situ)

- Benign: not able to metastasize or invade into structures so are characterised by slow, localised growth
- Does not become a systemic disease, can be treated with Surgical Removal and are rarely fatal but can be damaging via their mass effect and compression of surrounding structures
- Malignant: can invade underlying structures and so they are potentially able to metastasize, characterised by rapid growth.
- Potentially, a systemic disease can be primary or secondary/metastatic so this is an important consideration, notably if tumours are found in sites that commonly receive metastases (Lung, Bone, Liver and Brain).
- Whether a tumour is primary or secondary can be determined by assessing Hx and also, Immunohistochemistry to identify tissue specific markers on the tumour to identify the site of origin for the tumour
- Tumours of Uncertain Malignant Potential have features of both Benign and Malignant Masses so their behaviour and metastatic potential is unknown
- Metastatic Tumours have the same morphological/biological characteristics and have the same response to Rx as the Primary Tumour from which they were derived

# Classification of Neoplasms

- As a rule, neoplasms are classified according to the type of normal
tissue they most closely resemble and hence, the tissue from which they originated.
- Within the body, the major tissues are:
1. Epithelium: skin, lining of GI, urinary tract and solid abdominal organs (e.g. liver, kidney, pancreas).
2. Connective tissue: muscle, fat, bone, cartilage, nerves and blood vessels.
3. Lymphoid and blood forming tissues: lymph node, spleen, bone marrow and thymus.
4. CNS - Neurons and Glia
5. Germ cells: testis, ovary.

---

# 3 Main Types of Cancer

1. Carcinoma (80-85%): characteristics of epithelium and hence, are malignant epithelial tumours.
2. Lymphoma (15%): Tumours with characteristics of lymphoreticular cells not circulating and are usually limited to Lymphoid Structures like Lymph Nodes, Spleen and sometimes, solid organs.
- Leukaemia: circulating malignant lymphoreticular cells.
1. Sarcoma (2%): has characteristics of connective tissue/muscle (smooth and skeletal), bond, cartilage, endothelium, fibroblasts,
fat, tendon/ligament → These are malignant CT Tumours.

# What Features Distinguish Benign From Malignant Cells Histologically?

- Nuclear size/chromatin pattern/nuclear membrane (Malignant Cells have a large nucleus, with coarse and clumped chromatin and irregular nuclear membrane shape).
- Nuclear pleomorphism (difference in size and shape) → Characteristic of Malignant Tumours.
- Mitotic activity (but this could reflect hyperplasia) → Characteristic of Malignant Tumours due to their rapid proliferation
- Abnormal mitotic figures/mitoses (Cells that have been stained whilst they are undergoing Mitosis) → Abnormal Mitoses (E.g Tripolar Mitotic Figure) should not be seen in Hyperplasia and hence, are more indicative of Malignancy.
- Growth pattern/architecture.

|  | Benign | Malignant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Growth | Slow | Fast |
| Ulceration | Unusual | Frequent |
| Haemorrhage | Unusual | Frequent → Due to Angiogenesis and Invasion |
| Spread | No | Frequent |

# Nomenclature

### Epithelial Neoplasms

|  | Benign | Malignant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Squamous | Squamous Papilloma | Squamous Carcinoma |
| Glandular | Adenoma | Adenocarcinoma |
| Transitional | Transitional Papilloma | Transitiojnal Carcinoma |
| Liver | Hepatocellular Adenoma | Hepatocellular Carcinoma |

### Connective Tissue Neoplasms → Usually Contain Abnormal/Distorted Features of Their Normal Cellular Counterparts

- For more anaplastic tumours that are very poorly differentiated, it can make it very difficult to identify the type of tissue based on its morphology as it no longer resembles its cell of origin, meaning Immunohistochemistry is more useful here to identify tissue-specific cellular markers to Dx the Tumour

|  | Benign | Malignant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bone | Osteoma | Osteosarcoma |
| Cartilage | Chondroma | Chondrosarcoma |
| Fat | Lipoma | Liposarcoma |
| Smooth Muscle | Leiomyoma | Leiomyosarcoma |
| Skeletal Muscle | Rhabdomyoma | Rhabdomyosarcoma |
| Blood Vessels | Angioma | Angiosarcoma |
| Fibrous Tissue | Fibroma | Fibrosarcoma |

### Blood and Lymphoid Neoplasms

- There are no Benign Neoplasms within these categories are due to the normal migratory nature of Blood and Lymphoid Cells, they cannot remain localised to one position and are inheritently metastatic and likely to be found widespread in the body
- These are usually chronic and unlike to be fatal to the Px but at the same time, are much more difficult to Rx (E.g Follicular Lymphoma).
- They have the potential to transform into more aggressive phenotypes, where they can become fatal.

|  | Malignancy |
| --- | --- |
| Lymphocytes | Lymphoma |
| Marrow Granulocytes | Myeloid Leukaemia |
| Marrow Lymphocytes | Lymphocytic Leukaemia |
| Plasma Cells | Multiple Myeloma |

### Macroscopic Appearance

- When describing tumours, it is important to describe their Macroscopic Appearance and their growth appearance before histological analysis is undertaken
- Benign Tumours tend to have smooth, well-defined margins with intact capsules, usually very simple in shape. They also appear Homogenous in composition
- Malignant Tumours tend to have very complex shapes and roughened surface with very poorly defined tumour margins. They also appear very Heterogenous in composition, commonly containing darkened areas of Necrosis

---

# Adenoma/Adenocarcinoma

- Adenoma contains cells with a regular morphology, with few dysplastic features, and are arranged in a papillary structure with a core of Fibrovascular Tissue that does not appear to be invading into surrounding stroma
- Adenocarcinoma comprises of small, irregularly shaped glands formed by Highly Dysplastic Cells (Dark and Irregular)
- Surrounding the Dysplastic Glands, it appears as through the Stroma is being deformed by the Gland (Appears like the Stroma is bending/swirling around the Gland → Desmoplastic Stroma that indicates Invasion of Malignant cells in the stroma, causing reactive stromal changes)

# Metastasis

- Defined by the spread of a tumour to sites that are physically discontinuous with the primary tumour, and unequivocally marks a tumour as malignant.

### Growth and Spread of Malignant Neoplasms

- 4 main mechanisms by which tumours can spread to other sites in
the body:
1. Direct - Malignant Cells may infiltrate and destroy structures found immediately adjacent to them → This does not indicate Metastasis but demonstrates an aggressive tumour phenotype that is suggestive of Malignancy
2. Lymphatic invasion: malignant cells spread to regional lymph nodes and beyond through Lymphatic Fluid.
3. Blood vessel spread: Malignant Cells spread usually to the lung or liver or both through the blood.
4. Across serosal surfaces: Malignant Cells spread through pleura, pericardium and peritoneum to enter Pleural Cavities/Fluid and hence, spread to other structures bordering the Pleural Cavity.

### What Information Is Acquired From Pathological Examination?

1. Tumour type and subtype → Only provided by a Pathologist. This helps determine how the Px is managed/Rx regime and prognosis
2. Tumour grade: Only provided by a Pathologist and indicates how closely a tumour resembles its tissue of origin (Degree of Differentiation of the Neoplasm)?
- If the tumour is very similar microscopically to the tissue of origin, it is well-differentiated/grade 1/low grade and has the best prognosis but if it is hardly recognisable to its tissue of origin, it is poorly differentiated/grade 3/high grade with the worst prognosis.
- If its tissue of origin can be identified but it is difficult to do so due to a significant number of abnormal histological features within the tumour (Microscopic Features between Grade 1 and 3), it is intermeidate grade/grade 2
1. Tumour stage: a multidisciplinary approach. How large is the cancer? Can it be completely removed surgically with clear margins or will surgical removal leave some of the tumour left (E.g Degree of Invasion)?. Has it spread to the lymph nodes or beyond?
2. Excision margins
3. Other features of prognostic value: Use of molecular pathology in some cases to help determine what treatment the patient may
respond to 
- E.g Whether Tumour expresses Oestrogen and Progesterone Receptors and hence, is growing due to Sex Steroid Stimulation, which can be antagonised via Aromatase Inhibitors to reduce growth rate or whether HER2 is expressed in breast cancer, which means that Herceptin/Trastuzumab can be used to Rx the Cancer)

# Tumours

### Grade

- How closely a tumour resembles its tissue of origin.
- Grade I (well differentiated): if a tumour is very similar microscopically to tissue of origin.
- Grade II (intermediate grade): microscopic features between grade I and III.
- Grade III (poorly differentiated): hardly recognisable to its tissue of origin.
- Undifferentiated: if a tumour cannot be categorised to a particular cell type via Histological or Immunohistochemical Analytic Techniques (As it is extremely Anaplastic).

### Staging (TNN Staging)

- TNM staging developed by International Union against Cancer (UICC) and is specific for each organ but involves assessment of Tumour Size, Node Involvement and Degree of Metastasis.
- Refers to the extent of a spread.
- Requires a multidisciplinary approach involving Pathologists, Radiologists and Clinicians.
- The system for breast is as follows:

### Tumour - Size of Tumour

| Tis | Carcinoma In Situ |
| --- | --- |
| T1 | Gross Size of Tumour < 2.0cm in Diameter |
| T2 | Gross Size of Tumour = 2-5cm in Diameter |
| T3 | Gross Size of Tumour > 5cm in Diameter |
| T4 | Tumour of Any Size Involving Chest Wall or Skin |

### Node - Nodes Where Metastases Are Found

| N0 | No Nodes Involved |
| --- | --- |
| N1-3 | Determined based on the number of nodes involved, the specific Lymph Node Groups where metastases are found and the degree of tumour invovlement within a lymph node |

### Metastasis - Spread of Cancer

| M0 | No clinical or radiological evidence of distant metastases. |
| --- | --- |
| M1 | Metastases present elsewhere, either determined clinically/radiologically or confirmed histologically (Commonly Brain, Bone and Liver for Breast Cancer). |
- Pathologists provide information of T and N Stages whereas Radiologists usually determine M Stage but Pathologist can be involved in the M Stage if M Stage is determined by identification of a potential metastasis as a Metastatic/Secondary Tumour from a distant site

# **Molecular Testing to Identify Potential Therapeutics in Breast Cancer
Treatment**

### Example Pathology Report For The Breast

- If there is Malignant Tissue present at the specific excision margins when tumours are removed surgically, this is suggestive that not all of the Tumour was removed during the surgery and therefore, clear tumour margins were not achieved.
- Analysis and Identification of different Tumour Margins is usually performed by assigning a specific stain colour to a Specific Margin and differentially staining tissue samples from each margin of the Excised Tumour to look for the presence of Malignant Tissue within each tissue margin

![Screenshot 2022-03-11 at 14.12.30.png](%5B032%5D%20Cancer%20Pathology%20d52a08598636460ea4bd9bf4523c6faa/Screenshot_2022-03-11_at_14.12.30.png)

- To visualise the tumour, the Biopsy is sliced to form Multiple, Thin Sections which allows for visualisation of the appearance, size and margins of each of the tumours present within the removed tissue at each of the various levels/cross-sections
- The Size of the Tumour and the Distance of the Tumour from the surgical excision margins are very important to note as it allows for determination of the Tumour Staging and determination of whether complete tumour excision has been achieved

![Screenshot 2022-03-11 at 14.12.39.png](%5B032%5D%20Cancer%20Pathology%20d52a08598636460ea4bd9bf4523c6faa/Screenshot_2022-03-11_at_14.12.39.png)

### Classification of Mammary Carcinomas - Tumour Type and Subtype

- The tumour is then analysed under a Microscope to determine the Organ and then, Tissue of Origin

**Ductal Origin:**

1. Papillary adenoma
2. Intraductal carcinoma
3. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma

**Lobular Origin:**

1. Intralobular carcinoma
2. Infiltrating lobular carcinoma
- Normal Breast Tissue is divided into Discrete Segments of Glandular and Lobular Tissue but in Benign Tumours, there can be expansion of Glandular, Lobular or Stromal Tissue, compressing other tissue types

![Screenshot 2022-03-11 at 14.17.55.png](%5B032%5D%20Cancer%20Pathology%20d52a08598636460ea4bd9bf4523c6faa/Screenshot_2022-03-11_at_14.17.55.png)

- Tumour Grade is then assessed by assessing how well differentiated the tumour is as well as whether a Carcinoma In Situ is present or not
- Tumour Stage is then determined to assess the extent of the disease, which helps to predict prognosis and select the most efficacious therapies:
1. Pathological Staging - Determination of T and N Scores
2. Radiological Staging - Determine M Store
- Next, it is determined whether Malignant Tissue is found at/near the Tumour Margins or not
- Finally, Other features of Prognostic Value (E.g Specific Expression of Molecules which can be used as Drug Targets for Rx such as Oestrogen and Progesterone Receptor Expression in Breast Cancer)

### Other Features of Prognostic Value - Her2/neu

- Her2/neu or C-erb-B2 is overexpressed in approximately 25% of breast cancers
- When EGF4 Receptors Heterodimerise with Her2, this induces a more potent activation of EGF4Rs than that seen with EGF4R Homodimerisation, causing Hyperactivation of Downstream Pathways, including the MAPKK Pathway which regulates cell proliferation, survival, metastasis and angiogenesis
- Her2/neu expression is positively correlated with poor outcome in node+ and node- ve disease where cancer is and isn’t found in nodes
- Recombinant humanised anti-Her2 monoclonal antibody (Herceptin/Trastuzumab)
