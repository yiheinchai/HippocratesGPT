# Hardy-Weinberg

- p²+2pq+q² = 1
- p = dominant allele frequency and q = recessive allele frequency
- p² = Probability of being Homozygous dominant, 2pq = probability of being Heterozygous/carrier and q² = Probability of being Homozygous Recessive
- If estimating the probability of an individual being a carrier and it is known from the Pedigree/Information that they do not have the recessive condition, probability = 2/3 as you can exclude the Homozygous Recessive possibility from the Probability Calculation
- For X-Linked Recessive Conditions, Males are Hemizygous and therefore, Recessive Allele Frequency (q) = Genotype for males (Probability of Having X-Linked Recessive Condition) and Dominant Allele Frequency (p) = Probability of not having condition for males
- Punnett Squares tell you the probability of a specific offspring genotype from the genotypes of the parents. To calculate the overall risk of child having a genotype, you must do Punnett Square Frequency x Genotype Frequency (From Hardy-Weinberg Equation)
