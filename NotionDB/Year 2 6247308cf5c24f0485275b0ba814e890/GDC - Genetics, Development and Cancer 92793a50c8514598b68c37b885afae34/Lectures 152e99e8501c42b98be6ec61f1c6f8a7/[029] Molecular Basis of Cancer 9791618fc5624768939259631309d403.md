# [029] Molecular Basis of Cancer

# History of Discovery of Cancer Mechanisms

- Peyton Rous discovered a chicken sarcoma virus called Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV)
- He removed a Sarcoma from a Chicken, ground it up with sand and then passed it through a fine-pore filter to produce a filtrate which he then inkected into young chickens without the sarcoma
- He noticed that some of these injected chickens developed Sarcomas, indicating that the Cancer was transmissible and likely caused by a Microorganism

# RNA Tumour Virus - Oncogene Concept

- 1976: Bishop and Varmus proved that genes within Rous sarcoma
virus which caused cancer (oncogenes) were actually present in
normal chicken DNA.
- The virus had captured them, often with mutations.
- Cellular normal version of these oncogenes became known as proto-oncogene > 70 have been identified, which play a role in normal cell proliferation.
- Proto-Oncogene expression must be tightly regulated to prevent excessive cellular proliferation which can lead to tumour formation
- Chickens are regularly infected with Avian Leukosis Virus, a Type C Retrovirus with 3 Genes (gag, pol and env) and when coinfected with other Viruses, Transduction can occur, where a gene from another virus is inserted into the viral genome and if this gene is favourable and provides a survival advantage to the virus, it will persist in the genome
- Transduction of ALV with the Src Gene at the 3’ end of the env gene produces the Rous Sarcoma Virus, where Src is unregulated, meaning it is overexpressed and becomes an Oncogene (forming Sarcomas)
- Insertional Mutagenesis occurs when there is insertion of the Viral Genome (Provirus) into the Host Genome just upstream of a proto-oncogene, where the promoter region that stimulates Proviral Replication also stimulates the expression of the Proto-Oncogene, leading to overexpression of the Proto-Oncogene to form an Oncogene
- The Provirus can also insert within a proto-oncogene itself to deregulate it, causing overexpression of the proto-oncogene to form an Oncogene
- Oncogene: gene that when overexpressed or subjected to a gain-
of-function mutation causes cancer or can transform cells.
- Protooncogene: normal gene which when mutated becomes an
oncogene.

# Concept of Cell Transformation

- When Normal Cells are cultured, they proliferate for a finite period of time to increase the size of the cell population, with their proliferation rate slowly decreasing and plateauing, becoming senescent and then apoptosing
- The Number of times that a cell can replicate/proliferate before reaching Senescence when they no longer proliferate = Hayflick Limit
- In some cells, when they are no longer proliferating, they can undergo Transformation (notably via Oncogene activity) that can proliferate indefinitely as they do not become senescent

![Untitled](%5B029%5D%20Molecular%20Basis%20of%20Cancer%209791618fc5624768939259631309d403/Untitled.png)

### Properties of Transformed Cells

- Altered morphology - They become rounded and refractile in phase-contrast microscope (appear bright).
- Loss of contact growth inhibition (Cells no longer stop growing when they come into contact with neighbouring cells, giving them the ability to grow over one another).
- Ability to grow without attachment to solid substrate (anchorage independence).
- Ability to proliferate indefinitely (immortalisation).
- ↓ requirement for mitogenic growth factors from the environment/surounding cells to allow growth to occur (they can stimulate their own growth independently).
- Sometimes, these transformed cells can be tumourigenic but not all transformed cells form tumours when introduced into living organsisms

### Most Cancers Arise From Epithelia

- This is because:
1. Epithelial Cells are rapidly proliferating (e.g Gut and Bone Marrow) and hence, more likely to acquire mutations during DNA Replication that can lead to Malignant Transformation
2. They are found at the interface between the body and environment and hence, are more likely to be exposed by Mutagens which can cause Malignant Transformation

---

# Cellular and Molecular Mechanisms

- Whilst some cancers can be caused by Viral Infection, most cancers do not have viral causes, leading to the concept that Cancer was caused by mutations in normal growth-controlling genes (Proto-Oncogens) by Carcinogens, causing them to become Oncogenes
- Therefore, Cancer is a disease of genome caused by Epigenetic or Genetic Alterations
- Whilst DNA Damage that can give rise to Cancer can be from External Causes/Carcinogens, the majority of DNA Mutations that give rise to cancer are thought to be due to by-products of Internal cellular processes AKA Internal Carcinogens that comprise of errors in replication and mitosis, ROS and other metabolites from detoxifying processes within cells

# Oncogenes - Drivers of Cellular Proliferation

1. DNA is extracted from mouse fibroblasts that have been chemically transformed to cause mutations to arise in some sequences within the DNA.
2. DNA was transfected with human tumour DNA using calcium phosphate co-precipitation procedure so that the tumour DNA was now present within the Fibroblast DNA.
3. Transformed DNA is then taken up into normal mouse fibroblasts, allowing the Tumour DNA to enter some cells where it can cause the formation of a localised cluster of morphologically transformed cells, surrounded by normal, non-transformed cells
4. These morphologically transformed cells can then be introduced into a mouse host, where they proliferate further to form a Tumour
5. The Tumour can then be biopsied and analysed to identify the mutated gene that likely gave rise to the Malignant Transformation of the Cells and hence, Cancer

# Transfecting Pieces of a Transforming DNA Sequence (Oncogene) and Non-Transforming Version of the Same DNA Sequence (Proto-Oncogene) To Map Mutation

- To identify the region of the Proto-Oncogene (Extracted from the Tumour Biopsy) that was mutated to cause it to become an Oncogene , the associated Proto-Oncogene and Oncogene were cut and attached to the other so that 2 genes were produced that consisted of a Proto-Oncogene and Oncogene segment
- These 2 recombinant genes were then injected into separate cell cultures and whichever gene produced a focus/collection of Malignantly Transformed Cells within the culture contained the mutation that converted the Proto-Oncogene into the Oncogene
- The Recombinant Proto-Oncogene/Oncogene DNA that caused the Transformation was then extracted again and the Oncogene region of the DNA was cut further and exchanged with a corresponding region of a Proto-Oncogene and injected again into a Colony of Cells to see which Recombinant Gene formed a focus of Malignant Cells
- This process was repeated until the region of the Oncogene that contained the mutation was narrowed down to a 350bp Oncogene segment that contained the mutation and hence, could be easily sequenced

# How Do Proto-Oncogenes Become Oncogenes?

### Mutations

- Bladder cancer from middle-aged cancer.
- Carcinogens passed from lungs to blood to kidneys to urine.
- Carcinogen then attacks bladder cell, causing a point mutation within a cell that survived the mutation, producing an Oncogene that leads to Malignant Transformation and hence, Clonal Proliferation to form a tumour
- Example: G→T Point Mutation in the H-Ras Proto-Oncogene alters the GGC Codon (Glycine) so it now becomes GTG (Valine), altering the H-Ras so that it becomes an Oncogene.

### Oncogene Amplification

- Example: N-myc gene amplification and neuroblastoma is caused by preferential Replication of the proto-oncogene as a result of Slipped Strand Mismatch.
- Preferential DNA Amplification produces Proto-Oncogene Tandem Arrays comprised of multiple copies of the Proto-Oncogene, leading to increased gene dosage which gives rise to cancer.
- Amplification of the proto-oncogene results in a lower probability of event free survival over time following initial diagnosis and treatment.
- The majority of Proto-Oncogenes are:
1. Cell Signalling Molecules
2. Transcription Factors
3. Cell Cycle Regulatory Proteins
4. DNA Damage Proteins that repair Mutated DNA Sequences or causes Apoptosis of Cells containing large mutations
- Differential Oncogene Expression within different tissues can give rise to different types of Cancers

### Translocation Between Chromosomes

- Example: translocations in human tumours can deregulate proto- oncogene expression and therefore create oncogenes.
- Philadelphia chromosome is a specific abnormality in
chromosome 22 of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) cells, in
which Abl1 gene of chromosome 9 is juxtaposed onto BCR gene on
chromosome 22 due to a break point occurring within the abl and bcr genes on Chromosomes 9 and 21.
- This leads to over-expression of fusion protein BCR-ABL, which is a tyrosine kinase that drives cell division by causing the expression of IL-3Rβ and inhibits DNA repair, causing genomic instability.
- This establishes a positive feedback loop where BCR-ABL Expression causes genomic instability where alongside high rates of cellular proliferation, there is an increased risk of Mutations occurring within the newly synthesised DNA, causing Transformed Cells to accumulate more mutations which can cause the cells to become Malignant
- Chromosomal Translocations that give rise to fusion genes that can produce cancer tend to occur within B and T Cells (but also in Prostate Cells where they cause Prostate Carcinoma) as the Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain locus (IGH) translocates regularly in the normal Immune Response to produce various different classes of Ig, meaning there is an increased risk of a Chromosomal Translocation Mutation occuring which gives rise to a Fusion Gene that can cause cancer
- E.g Overpression of Anti-Apoptotic Bcl-2 Protein in Lymphocytes alone does not cause cancer but when it is overexpressed simultaneously alongside the proto-oncogene Myc, the mutated cell has mutatons that prevent death (Immortalisation) and drive proliferation, meaning the mutated cell may produce aggressive B-Cell Malignancies including Lymphoma

# Balance Between Oncogenes and Tumour Suppressor Genes

- Tumour Suppressor Genes oppose the activity of Proto-Oncogenes to inhibit cellular proliferation and movement through the cell cycle to prevent excessive cellular proliferation that can give rise to Cancer
- Some proto-oncogenes have intrinsic apoptotic mechanisms integrated alongside their normal proliferative function, allowing them to act both as Proto-Oncogenes and Tumour Suppressor Genes
- When expressed, C-Myc can drive cellular proliferation and activate apoptotic pathway, with the net result of C-Myc expression determined by the presence of other factors within the cell.
- In presence of survival factors, the activity of Apoptotic Signals from C-Myc is suppressed, so apoptosis is inhibited to allow for C-Myc to produce cellular proliferation
- If the Cell expressing C-Myc migrates away from its normal environment, the absence of Survival Factors means that the apoptotic activity of C-Myc is no longer suppressed, causing C-Myc to trigger apoptosis to prevent the migrating cell from proliferating and metastasising to produce cancer
- In Cancerous cells, C-Myc can be mutated so that it can no longer activate the Apoptotic Pathway, meaning that cells that have migrated from their normal tissue and express C-Myc no longer undergo apoptosis in the absence of the Survival Factors, allowing them to proliferate and migrate where they can cause Metastatic Cancers
- Early cell fusion experiments provide evidence that viral-induced
transformations are dominant, but chemically induced
transformations are recessive.
- This was shown as if the fusion of a normal and cancerous cell produced a Hybrid Cell that was tumourigenic, the Cancer alleles are dominant whereas if the Hybrid Cell was not tumorigenic, the Cancer Alleles were recessive

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.01.03.png](%5B029%5D%20Molecular%20Basis%20of%20Cancer%209791618fc5624768939259631309d403/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.01.03.png)

# Retinoblastoma

- Retinoblastoma is a rare cancer that occurs within Photoreceptors in the Retina and has 2 apparent forms:
1. Hereditary retinoblastoma: occurs in both eyes with Retinoblastoma developing in younger individuals. Despite removal of tumours, they are still prone to other cancers due to the presence of the mutation in other cells of the body and hence, have a poor prognosis.
2. Sporadic retinoblastoma: occurs in 1 eye with cancer with Retinoblastoma developing in older individuals. Following the Removal of the tumour, the Tumour does not reoccur (as Mutation is localised to Photoreceptors vs being present in other somatic cells in the body) and patient has good prognosis.
- Therefore, the difference between Hereditary and Sporadic Retinoblastomas led to the idea that Familial Tumours were consistent with a single random genetic event/mutation whilst the Sporadic tumours behaved as though they required 2 events to occur
- Knudson’s two hit hypothesis: Multiple hits to DNA are
required to cause cancer.
- In children with inherited retinoblastoma, 1st hit/mutation to Rb was inherited in DNA and any 2nd hit/mutation in somatic cells rapidly leads to cancer.
- This means that as fewer mutation events were required for tumorigenesis to occur, the Tumours usually developed early on in life
- In Sporadic Retinoblastoma, both Rb alleles are healthy/non-mutated, meaning that 2 mutation events/hits are required for the cell to become mutated sufficiently to produce a Tumour - Therefore as more mutation events are required than that seen in Inherited Retinoblastoma, Sporadic Retinoblastoma usually occurs later
- Children born with 1 defective copy of Rb (retinoblastoma) gene developed cancer when 2nd copy was spontaneously lost, which occurs more frequently when 1 copy of Rb is defective than when it is functional as Rb’s role in maintaining the Integrity of the Genome meant that when it one copy is defective, there is an increased risk of mutations occurring and persisting within the genome

### Key Tumour Suppressor Genes

- pRb is a key checkpoint protein that prevents the cells from moving from G1 → S within the cell cycle if uncorrected mutations are detected within the genome, preventing mitosis and hence, proliferation from occurring.
- pRb prevents excessive cell proliferation of mutated cells by inhibiting cell cycle progression until the mutation is corrected and the cell is ready to divide to produce daughter cells with non-mutated genomes.
- pRb is phosphorylated and becomes inactive to allow cell cycle progression.
- Interfering with this process allows inappropriate growth and fosters genomic instability by allowing the accumulation of mutations in progressive generations of cells (as mutations are not corrected before Mitosis), leading to more mutations accumulating.
- P53: another key cell cycle regulator and ‘guardian of genome’.
- It activates DNA repair proteins when DNA is damaged. Arrests
growth G1/S regulation point if DNA damage is recognised to allow sufficient time for the mutation to be corrected before mitosis, preventing cells from replicating until the genome is free from mutations to prevent mutations from being immortalised and passed on to daughter cells.
- If the DNA Repair is successful, Cellular Arrest by p53 is removed, allowing the cell to undergo Mitosis and proliferate but If DNA Repair is unsuccessful as the mutation is too extensive for repair, p53 activates Apoptosis to destroy the mutated cell or forces the cell into Senescence to prevent the cell from proliferating
- p53 is usually activated by Cellular Stress/Damage, Oncogene Expression and the presence of Mutations

# Hereditary Cancer Syndromes

- Predispose individuals (i.e., strong risk factors)
- Often cause early development of cancers in younger individuals
- Underlie 5-10% of all cancers
- Often tumour suppressor genes are involved

| Cancer | Gene |
| --- | --- |
| Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) | APC (Most Common Mutated Gene in Colon Cancer) |
| Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer | BRCA1 and BRCA2 - They are responsible for DNA Damage Repair |
| Gastric Cancer | CHD1 (E-Cadherin) |

### E-Cadherin (Encoded by CDH1 Gene)

- Localises to cell-cell contacts at the periphery of the cell membrane, holding epithelial cells together to prevent cellular migration
- It is Important in embryonic development and metastasis
- E-cadherin level changes in EMT (covered in different lecture on metastasis) to allow cells to become migratory
- Inactivation or loss is a major risk factor in certain breast and gastric carcinomas

# Mechanisms for Inactivating/Losing 2nd Tumour Suppressor Allele In Herediatary Cancer Syndromes

### Mitotic Recombination Leads to Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)

- Occurs in retinoblastomas.
- If there is a LoF Mutation to a TSG on a sister Chromosome, following DNA Replication to form Sister Chromatids, Recombination of Homologous Chromosome pairs can lead to the formation of Homologous Chromosomes that contain 1 functional and 1 non-functional TSG
- Following Chromosomal Recombination where one defective gene is present on each Homologous Chromosome, Segregation of Recombinated Chromosomes can either lead to retention of Heterozygosity where each daughter cell inherits one defective TSG on one Sister Chromatid and a functional TSG on another or Loss of Rb Heterozygosity where one daughter cell inherits 2 copies of the functional TSG and the other inherits 2 copies of the non-functional TSG
- If mitotic recombination leads to a defective gene being present on 2 chromatids on either homologous chromosomes, it can be inherited by 1 daughter cell, meaning the daughter cell does not express any functional copies of the TSG

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.04.32.png](%5B029%5D%20Molecular%20Basis%20of%20Cancer%209791618fc5624768939259631309d403/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.04.32.png)

### Gene Conversion Leads to Loss of Heterozygosity

- During DNA Replication, DNA Polymerase begins replication on the template strand of one chromosome and randomly jumps to replicate the downstream region of the Template Strand of the Homologous Chromosome, before jumping back to the Original Chromosome to finish replicating
- This means that the DNA Strand produced by DNA Synthesis contains genes from both Homologous Chromosomes and if the non-functional TSG is found on the section of the Homologous Chromosome that is replicated when DNA Polymerase jumped to the Homologous Chromosome, this causes the replication of a non-functional TSG instead of a functional TSG, meaning no functional TSG genes are replicated and inherited by the daughter cell

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 00.05.25.png](%5B029%5D%20Molecular%20Basis%20of%20Cancer%209791618fc5624768939259631309d403/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_00.05.25.png)

### Chromosomal Non-Disjunction and Loss of Heterozygosity

- If an individual is Heterozygous at a TSG Locus, Mitotic Non-Disjunction can cause 1 daughter cell to retain both chromatids of a chromosome containing the mutated TSG Gene alongside 1 Chromatid expressing the normal TSG Gene rather than a single one, leading to triploidity
- In the Triploid Cell, one of the extra chromosomes may be shed at random to maintain normal gene dosage and if the Chromosome that is discarded expresses the Functional TSG, this means the 2 remaining Chromosomes express the non-functional TSG
- LOH can sometimes occur when a chromosomal region breaks off
and is not repaired/replaced.
- This is called hemizygosity and when the lost chromosomal region contains the functional TSG Gene, this means that only the non-functional TSG gene is present.
- LOH has served as an important genetic screen for many tumour
suppressor genes to identify Malignant Cells.

# MicroRNAs - Gene Expression Regulators Which Can Be Dysregulated In Cancer

- Small, non-coding RNAs synthesised by RNA Polymerase II.
- They are formed by the cleavage of Proto-RNA which are cleaved and then incorporated into a RISC Complex
- They are highly conserved across the population
- They form Watson-Crick pairings within mRNA at the 3’ UTR of genes.
- If the microRNA forms perfect/complementary base pairs with a region on mRNA, it degrades that mRNA to prevent the expression of the gene/production of the gene product and if it forms imperfect base pairs with an mRNA segment, it leads to translational inhibition of gene expression in normal cells - This means they have tumour suppressing activity.
- In Cancerous Cells, duplication/GoF mutations to MicroRNA alter microRNAs expression and activity within cells, altering the expression of genes which can cause dysregulation of gene expression to drive Malignant Transformation
- MicroRNA are not as potent in their Tumour Supression Activity as Tumour Suppressor Genes but serve to fine tune gene expression in a tissue and time specific manner and hence, are often used as Biomarkers for cancer to indicate dysregulation of gene expression

### Epigenetic Changes Can Lead to Inappropriate Gene Regulation

- These are changes in DNA which are not at level of bases but rather alter epigenetic markers of the genome that hence alters the expression of the genome.
- 5-Methycytosine is produced by the Methylation of C5 in Cytosine, covalently modifying DNA but not causing mutations.
- This tends to happen at CpG Dinucleotide Islands and are inherited in Mitosis from one cellular generation to the next, where methylation of the genome inhibits gene transcription
- Whilst Genetic Mutations that give rise to cancer can be difficult to Rx as they require the use of targeted gene therapy, Epimutations can be more easily corrected as they can be targetted by drugs which can prevent/reverse epigenetic alterations that can give rise to cancer
- There may be methylation of repetitive sequences and histone
modifications.
- Typically, in cancer cells, there is hypomethylation of DNA, and
this loss of histone methylation means that chromatin becomes
unwrapped and unsilenced, which can lead to proto-oncogene overexpression to cause it to become an oncogene and produce Malignant Transformation.

# Hallmarks of Cancer

### Original

- Sustaining proliferative signalling (Often via TSG LoF and Oncogene GoF).
- Evading growth suppressors (E.g Cytokines and Apoptotic Factors).
- Activating invasion and metastasis.
- Enabling replicative immortality (Removal of Hayflick Limit) via expression of Telomerase (TERT) to maintain Telomere Length at the end of Chromosomes to prevent Chromosomal Instability that usually triggers Senescence and Apoptosis.
- Inducing angiogenesis to provide metabolic support for the rapidly growing tumour and a method of metastasis
- Resisting cell death/apoptosis (Notably by inhibiting Apoptotic Pathways of Proto-Oncogenes).

### Revised (Include Original and New Hallmarks)

**Emerging Hallmarks**

1. Deregulating cellular energetics 
- Warburg effect most cancer cells produce energy by a high rate of glycolysis followed by lactic acid fermentation in cytoplasm, rather than low rate of glycolysis followed by oxidation in mitochondria in most normal cells, even in normoxic environments
- This is because increased Lactic Acid Production causes wider tissue destruction, allowing Cancer Cells to more easily invade tissue and metastasise whilst increased Production of Glycolytic Intermediates can be shuttled into Nucleic Acid and FA Synthesis which allow for a more rapid rate of proliferation.
1. Avoiding immune destruction - CD8+ cells can look for cancer cells.
- Genome Instability and Mutation:
- Usually, TSG Mutations are those that are inherited in Hereditary Cancers (E.g p53 and Rb). This LoF to TSG results in Genomic Instability which increases the risk of Mutations in Cells being immortalised as Mutated Cells do not undergo cellular arrest before Mitosis during which DNA can be repaired, allowing the Transformed Cells to acquire the other characteristics of cancer seen in the Hallmarks of Cancer
- However, Sporadic Cancers usually start by GoF mutations to Proto-Oncogenes, producing Oncogenes that result in Overproliferation of Cells
- This increased rate of cellular proliferation increases the frequency of mutations occurring during DNA Replication, which leads to Genomic Instability and a selective pressure for TSG Inactivation (E.g p53).
- Subsequent TSG Inactivation (E.g p53 Inactivation) means that Transformed Cells evade Apoptosis whilst genomic instability and the acquisition of additional mutations lead to the establishment of the features seen in the other Hallmarks of Cancer, similar to how this occurs in Hereditary Cancers

**Enabling Characteristics**

- Tumour-promoting inflammation:
1. Many inflammatory conditions predispose to cancer.
2. Cancer arise at sites of chronic inflammation.
3. Functional polymorphisms of cytokine genes are associated with cancer susceptibility and severity.
4. Distinct populations of inflammatory cells are detected in many cancers.
5. Extent of tumour-associated macrophage infiltrate correlates with prognosis.
6. Inflammatory cytokines are detected in many cancers. High levels are associated with poor prognosis.
7. Chemokines are detected in many cancers. They are associated with inflammatory infiltrate and cell motility.
8. Deletion of cytokines and chemokines protects against carcinogens, experimental metastases and lymphoproliferative syndrome
9. Inflammatory cytokines are implicated in action of nongenotoxic liver carcinogens.
10. Inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor is directly transforming in vitro.
11. Long-term NSAID use ↓ mortality from colorectal cancer.

# Summary - Cellular Process Typically Altered In Cancer Cells

- Cell cycle
- Cellular signalling pathways (growth, differentiation and death).
- Cellular metabolism
- DNA repair
- Telomere regulation
- Genomic stability
- Interaction with extracellular matrix and micro-environment.
- Interaction with immune system.
- Cell behaviour: invasiveness and ability to metastasize.
- Genes that drive cell growth and division or maintain Telomere length are likely to be Oncogenes whereas Genes that cause cellular arrest or Apoptosis when uncontrolled proliferation or DNA Damage is seen are likely to be TSGs
