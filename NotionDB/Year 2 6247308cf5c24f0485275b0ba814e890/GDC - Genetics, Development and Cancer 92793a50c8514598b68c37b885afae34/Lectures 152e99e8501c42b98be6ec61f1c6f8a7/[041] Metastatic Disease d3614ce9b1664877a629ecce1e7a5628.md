# [041] Metastatic Disease

# Metastasis and TMN Staging

- Metastasis = Malignant tumour growth at least one site in the body, the cells of which are derived from a malignancy located elsewhere in the body.

### TMN Staging

- TNM Staging (Tumour Size, Number and Specific Nodes Involved, If Metastases are present) provides an important prognostic information and indicates approach to treatment and the extent of Rx required to effectively treat the cancer.
- TNM is specific to the type of tumour being assessed

### Tumour Microenvironment

- TME is made up of both tumour and non-tumour cells.
- Some cell types, such as macrophages, can be recruited into the TME and influence migratory and proteolytic activity of tumour cells through secretion of growth factors

### Stages of Metastasis

- Transformation (Cells acquire metastatic abilities) → Angiogenesis → Motility and Invasion into Vascular Lumen → Transport in the Circulation around the Body → Arrest in a Capillary Bed/Adherence (E.g Commonly Lung) → Extravasation into the Organ Parenchyma → Tumour Proliferation and Angiogenesis → Repeat
- This is cascade as it involves the formation of metastases formed from previous metastases, causing exponential growth of tumours at new sites
- All these steps are essential if a metastatic colony is to be formed. But note that each step is very inefficient, and is potentially rate limiting (of course, the first committed step – localized invasion – is arguably the most critical in the process).
- Overall probability that a single cell derived from the primary tumour will successfully form a distant colony is very low - This is known as metastatic inefficiency.

# Metastasis Cascade

### 1) Localised Invasion by Primary Tumour

- In situ carcinoma have developed a blood supply through angiogenesis and whilst they are not currently invading the basement membrane (they are surrounded by a capsule), they have malignant potential and can respond to signals in the TME to become invasive and proteolytic.
- Cells from the in situ carcinoma, undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), express extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteases (known as matrix metalloproteases, MMPs) and breach the basement membrane (BM) to become locally invasive
- The in situ carcinoma degrades the BM due to the activity of MMPs and at this stage is described as malignant.
- Note that degradation of BM releases growth factors into the TME which promote EMT.
- Invasive cells lose expression of E-cadherin which is a TSG necessary to maintain cell-cell contacts.
- Once carcinoma has become locally invasive it can enter circulation by intravasion and so, the degree at which a BM is degraded is correlated with the risk of metastasis.

### 2) Intravasation

- Similar process to local invasion but involves invasion of blood vessels and requires collaboration with non-tumour cells – macrophages which are recruited into the inflammatory TME
- Intravasating Tumour Cells move into blood or lymphatic microvessels while attached to/associated with Macrophages
- The process is still rather mysterious and difficult to study (impossible in humans because of ethical issues).

### 3) Transport Through the Circulation and 4) Arrest In Capillary Beds

**Transport Through The Circulation**

- Once in the circulation the carcinoma cell is described as a circulating tumour cell
- Unlike the TME (stroma), which is nurturing, the blood is a hostile environment for tumour cells.
- They are subject to sheer forces which can damage the cells and growth factors will be absent, meaning growth of the tumour cells cannot be supported here.
- Carcinoma cells are generally unsuited to to the circulation, most will not survive so do not metastasise in the blood.
- Also, cell survival is normally anchorage dependent: cells that detach from solid support normally enter a form of programmed cell death called anoikis.
- Like apoptosis, tumour cells can resist this, especially since
they can interact with blood components such as lymphocytes, platelets etc.
- Whilst sheer forces deform the erythrocytes, which are able to deform to effectively travel through vessels, most cancer cells are twice the size of erythrocytes and are not deformable, meaning they are likely to arrest within Capillary Beds

**Arrest In Capillary Beds**

- Circulating tumour cells attract clouds of platelets (B) so that they are in fact circulating aggregates of cells rather than single cells.
- Circulating tumour cells that have escaped from a primary tumour and entered the venous circulation must pass through the pulmonary circulation of the lung, where many tumour cells will become trapped.

### 5) Extravasation

- During extravasation the tumour cell leaves the lumen of the capillary and penetrates the surrounding tissue.
- This occurs by the Tumour Cell becoming surounded by Platelets, causing it to arrest within the capillary lumen, allowing the cancerous cell to degrade the Capillary basement membrane and Tissue Parenchyma via MMPs to allow the Cancer Cell to extravasate into the tissue
- Twist is a key protein that is expressed in cells that have undergone EMT

### 6) Formation of a Micrometastasis

- Following Extravasation, Cancer Cells are able to form Micrometastases within the Tissue
- Micrometastases are often not clinically detectable and may become dormant, remaining undetectable by the Immune System but with a potential to expand upon reactivation to re-enter the metastatic cascade and form a Macrometastasis.
- Many Px have micrometastases present in a wide range of highly vascular tissues (E.g Bone Marrow) but these do not necessarily form Macrometastases

### 7) Formation of a Macrometastasis (Colonisation)

- Accumulation and Vascularisation of Micrometastases allows Tumour Cells to proliferate further to form a Macrometastasis, from which the Metastatic Cascade begins again in widespread metastatic disease

# How Is a Cancer Cell Capable Of This Complex Metastatic Process?

- Tumour stroma promotes EMT of cancer cells.
- Non Tumour Cells such as macrophages are recruited to inflammatory environment and can secrete proinflammatory and growth factors that promote migration, EMT and angiogenesis. So, endogenous cells act as accomplices for tumour metastases.
- This features in a number of other steps in the metastatic process.
- E.g Once in the circulation tumour cells can aggregate with platelets, increasing the probability that the aggregate will get trapped in narrow capillaries.
- There is likely to be epigenetic alterations induced by the dramatic
changes in the tumour cells’ environment that are likely to be important in the expression of genes controlling EMT.
- Contextual signals – Particular signals in the microenvironment of the tumour cell finds itself in will epigenetically alter gene expression which can contribute to EMT by constitutively expressing genes responsible for cell migration that are usually expressed only in development and wound healing.

# Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)

- EMT is the transition of stable, non-motile epithelial cells to a motile and invasive phenotype as the result of a dramatic cellular reprogramming due to alterations in gene expression/transcription.
- In Cancer, EMT usually occurs due to the Loss of Expression of Molecules that maintain Cell Contacts and expression of genes that promote an invasive and motile phenotype.

| Loss of... | Acquisition of... |
| --- | --- |
| E-Cadherin | Fibroblast-like Shape |
| Epithelial Cell Polarity | Motility and Invasiveness |
| Epithelial Gene Expression | Prostease Secretion (MMPs) to allow for Invasive Phenotype |
|  | Mesenchymal Gene Expression Programme |

### EMT in Embryonic Development

- EMT in Embryonic Development allows the migration of cells from their site of origin to different sites of the embryo where they can differentiate to form various different structures

# Matrix Remodelling - Role of Proteases

- Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are secreted by malignant turmor cells, expression of which is a risk factor for metastatic disease.
- Probably the best known role in in the initial local invasion step but degradation of protein barriers will give the metastatic cell access to new compartments within the body to allow for widespread metastasis.

# Manifestation in Px

### How Does This Manifest?

- Residual disease - Some Cancer cells that remain after ablative therapy and/or chemo due to these cells acquiring additional mutations that provide them with Resistance to these Rx.
- These residual cells can be difficult to detect before metastatic colonies expand to produce a new tumour.
- Dormancy - Cancer cells can become reactivated at later stages to cause widespread metastases
- Can we predict which primary tumours will become metastatic? - Gene expression profile of primary and metastatic tumours can be compared to reveal genes involved in metastatic process.
- Similar gene expression panels are used clinically to predict risk that carcinoma in situ will become invasive.

### Mortality

- Metastatic disease is a spectrum and so, is not always deadly, with primary tumours of the same type in different individuals having different risks of metastasis
- Some patient develop only a small number of metastases with favourable histology and a slow rate of progression.
- Again, research using gene expression arrays is asking which genes are responsible for making a tumour relatively aggressive.
- The Future of Successful Rx probably lies in Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors that prevent Tumour Cells from suppressing Immune Responses targeted against them, allowing for the Immune Response to selectively target and destroy cancer cells (but they do have a risk of Autoimmunity due to Overactivation of the Immune System)

### Characteristics of Indolent Clinical Metastases (Oligometastatic Disease)

- Clinical: 1-5 lesions with a slow rate of progression and favorable histology (do not express markers seen in more aggressive cancers) → Good Prognosis
- Biological: Metastases activate host immunity to allow for immune surveillance and destruction of malignant cells, absence of mesenchymal features means cells are less invasive and less likely to become metastatic, low degree of intra-tumour heterogeneity means there is a relatively uniform cancer genome across the tumour cells, meaning fewer mutations have been accumulated and hence, cells are less likely to acquire mutations that allow them to develop an aggressive, invasive phenotype
