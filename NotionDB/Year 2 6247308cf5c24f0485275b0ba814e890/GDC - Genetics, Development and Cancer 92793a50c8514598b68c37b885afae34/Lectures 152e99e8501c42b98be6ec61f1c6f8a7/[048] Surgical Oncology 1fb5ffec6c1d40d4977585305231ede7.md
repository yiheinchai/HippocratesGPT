# [048] Surgical Oncology

# History

- Galen b.127AD – “Cut the root” - Galenic and hypocritic theories on medicine dominate and understood that it was necessary to remove the entirety of a tumour (including its stem/wider attachments) to completely resect the tumour
- They felt that this was very difficult to do and in many situations, the tumour had recurred before a scar could form/healing could occur, leading to the view that Cancer was a Terminal Condition at any stage
- Surgical development 1700’s UK - John Hunter “there is no impropriety in removing it’
- Lister – anaesthesia and asepsis led to the ability to spend longer on surgery to ensure complete resection of tumours to prevent recurrence.
- Growing knowledge of role of lymphatic spread of tumours from sites of primary development to Lymph Nodes led to better understanding of how cancer spreads and hence, how to completely remove tumours to prevent recurrence – e.g Virchow

### Radical Surgical Management

- Halstead – USA late 1800’s
- Developed Radical mastectomy - Local tumour removal (complete breast removal) plus radical nodal clearance which led to the complete removal of a tumour without recurrence (arm may be swollen as removal of lymph nodes in the arm impaired lymphatic drainage from tissue)
- Surgery does not address metastasis by haematogenous spread as surgery only removed Lymph Nodes (E.g Lymphatic Spread) and Tumours, but did not prevent Tumours from Metastasising to other region of the Body (e.g Lungs, Liver and Bone) through Vasculature)
- Therefore, it provided local and regional control of tumours

### Modern Surgical Oncology

- Modern Surgical Oncology has a balanced approach where surgical intervention is intense enough to ensure that there is control of the disease/tumour development at the local site but ensures that intervention is not so intense that it has negative impacts on Quality of Life and Function
- E.g Lumpectomies are carried out instead of Radical Massectomies where the Primary Breast Tumour is removed with a margin around it to improve survival without needing to remove the entire breast
- Modern Surgery for Tumour Removal is Tumour and Px Specific in order to provide the best results for the Px in regards to Cosmetics/Quality of Life and Prognosis

### Surgical Oncology

- MDT are used to manage Cancer Px by using input from mutliple different specialities to provide the most rounded and hence, effective Rx for the Px
- Surgical Oncology forms one part of a Multidisciplinary Team alongside Oncologists, where members from Various different departments work alongside one another to select the most effective Rx plan for the Px
- Most Surgical Oncology is Curative in purpose to remove the tumour, reconstruct the surrounding tissue to minimise tissue disturbance produced by surgery, rehabilitate the Px and remove enough of the tumour to stabilise the Px sufficiently to allow for Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy to be tolerated to remove remaining tumours cells
- MDTs also discuss the appropriate timing of surgery in regards to other aspects of Cancer Rx such as Radiotherapy or Chemotherapy:
- Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy Before the Surgery = Neo-Adjuvant
- Surgery and then Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy afterwards to completely clear remaining cells = Adjuvant Therapy

---

# Surgical Oncology

- For Many Solid Cancers (Notably Early Stage Tumours), Surgery is the main curative intervention and has a very good success rate
- If a Cancer is Disseminated in the Body as it originates in a Mobile Cell (E.g Haematological Maligancy), These are not surgical Rx as it is not appropriate to remove all the Lymph Nodes and Bone Marrow in the Body as it puts an individual at significant risk for infection
- As the Stage of the Cancer increases, the Prognosis/Success Rate of surgery decreases
- Whilst Early Cancers are primarily managed by Surgical Intervention Only, Later Stages of Cancer are managed via Multimodality Approaches involving Surgery and then Chemotherapy/Radiotherapy (Adjuvant Therapies)
- Some tumours are radioresistant/chemoresistant and hence, not affected by Radiotherapy and Chemotherapy, meaning that Surgery is the only curative intervention available

### Types of Surgery

- Diagnostic
- Staging
- Curative
- Debulking → If tumour affects the function of the Organ or is compressing surrounding structures, part of the Tumour can be removed, followed by Adjuvant Therapy to reduce its mass effect and hence, the compression/disturbance of surrounding structures
- Palliative – e.g. Reducing Pain via Neurectomies or Removal of Obstructions by Large Tumours (Defunctioning) by Creating a Stoma so Bowel Content diverts the region of the Colon obstructed by the tumour → Improve QoL
- Supportive → Surgery to enable the placement of devices into the Px to enable them to receive Rx (E.g Chemotherapy localised to a specific region)
- Reconstructive → Minimise disfiguration caused by surgical removal of Tumour
- Preventative → Removal of Tissue that is pre-cancerous to prevent cancer from arising

### DIagnostic Surgery

- Principle of biopsy → This is when a sample of the tissue is taken by the Surgeon and sent to a Pathologist to Dx the Tumour and identify the relationship between the tumour and surrounding tissue (Whether Tumour is invasive or not)
- This means it is important that the biopsy sent to the Pathologist includes the tumour itself (so it can be determined whether cells within the Tumour have undergone Malignant Transformation) and is taken from the Tumour Margin with the Surrounding Normal Tissue to determine whether the Tumour is invasive or not
- When a tumour is suspected, Incisional Biopsies are carried out when a sample is taken from inside the tumour itself rather than an excisional biopsy (where a whole tumour is removed and sampled) → This is because Incisional Biopsy ensures that tumour remains within the Body, allowing for wide margins to be identified for surgery to ensure complete cancer removal
- Apart from Incisional Biopsies, Biopsies can be conducted via:
1. Punch→ This produces a cylindrical sample through a tissue which can be sent off for a Biopsy (mainly done for superficial biopsies)
2. Trucut Biopsy → This is performed by Radiologists to investigate deeper Tumours where a Needle is inserted into a Tumour, to extract a small Core of Tissue from the Tumour which can be analysed
3. FNAC/Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology → This is where a needle is ultrasound guided and inserted into a tumour to aspirate Cells from within a Tumour, which can then be placed on a slide to analyse the cells for any Malignant Features
- This is not used for Dx a Primary Tumour as whilst it informs whether cells have undergone Malignant Transformation to appear Cancerous, it does provide a sample of the Tumour Margin and hence, cannot be used to determine tumour invasiveness (Whether Mass = Adenocarcinoma or Carcinoma In Situ etc.)
- Instead, this is used to Dx Abnormal Cells within Lymph Nodes to indicate Metastases
1. EUA → Examination Under Anaesthetic - This can be combined with a biopsy or can be conducted for staging purposes, where the Px is placed under General Anaesthetic for a short duration of time so the tumour and its margins + attachments can be visualised to allow for Surgical Plan to be established

# Assessing Suitability

### Staging of Tumours

- Early stage vs. late stage
- Local resection - Locoregional resection (Tumour + Regional Lymph Node Resection which may contain Micrometastases or Macrometastases)
- Therapeutic vs. elective Lymphadenectomy depending on the probability of metastasis into Local Lymph Nodes
- Whether Tumour is resectable and what is the chance of curing the Px from the Cancer with an without the Rx

**Pre-Operative Investigations**

- Examination (E.g EUA)
- Biopsy
- Imaging - CT, MRI and US (Triple Imaging) to analyse Primary Tumour, Regional Lymph Nodes to identify Metastases and other regions where there is risk of spread/invasion such as the Lungs from Head and Neck Cancer
- PET Scanning can be used to visualise tumour localisation to determine the degree of Metastases around the body that may not be visualised by other imaging modalities or examination

**TNM Staging (AJCC 8th Edition) of Tumours**

- Tumour
- Node
- Metastasis
- Stage 1-4

### Patient Factors

- Determines ability of Px to recover from Surgery both physically but also emotionally
- Medical History
- Social support network
- Psychological state
- Mobility and fitness
- Nutritional state
- Modifiable habits

---

# Surgical Technique

- Prior to Surgical Removal of Head and Neck Cancers, there are In Depth Pre-Operative Assessments to determine fitness (E.g Exercise Tests to determine Overall Cardiovascular Fitness to determine risks associated with Rx)
- Cancer often causes Malnourishment and Cachexia and therefore, this can impair healing following Surgery which can delay the point at which a Px is stable enough to start Adjuvant Therapy to maintain Rx of the Cancer following Surgery

### Planning

- Tumour access – minimal vs. maximal access (How is the tumour going to be accessed and what is the damage that this is going to/could cause to surrounding tissue)
- Structure sacrifice (when removing the tumour, what other structures will need to be removed to ensure complete resection of the tumour)
- Tumour blood supply → As some tumours are extremely vascular, embolization and anaethestic can be used to reduce Blood Supply to the Tumour to minimise blood loss during Surgery when the Tumour is being removed

### Tumour Excision

- When Surgically removing a tumour, it is important to have clear margins where there is a large enough margin of Healthy Tissue surrounding the entirety of the Tumour in the Resected portion of Tissue to ensure that all the tumour has been removed
- If a Resected Tumour has Negative/Clear Margins, there is a greater change of Disease Free Survival than that seen with Positive Margins where there is Tumour Involvement at the Excisions Sites
- Compartmental Resection → This is when the type of operation that is performed to remove the cancer is based on where the Tumour is located
- For Some Tissues where Functionally Distinct Structures are found adjacent to one another (E.g Brain Tissue), it is not possible to have wide margins without leading to large functional deficits
- In this case, The Majority of the Tumour is removed without removing any healthy tissue, with Adjuvant Therapy then being used after surgery to try and remove the rest of the Cancer that may be left behind
- Frozen Sections → When there is uncertainty about whether a Surgical Margin is tumour-free/clear, Sections from the Margins can be sent to the Lab, which can rapidly be analysed to determine whether there is Cancer present at the Margin or not

![Screenshot 2022-03-29 at 00.28.04.png](%5B048%5D%20Surgical%20Oncology%201fb5ffec6c1d40d4977585305231ede7/Screenshot_2022-03-29_at_00.28.04.png)

### Regional Nodal Management

- Different Techniques are used based on the probability that there has been the spread of Cancer to Lymph Nodes of not:
- Sentinel node biopsy – surgical staging test to determine whether Nodal Involvement has occurred and hence, whether Tumour is N0 or not
- Elective node dissection – risk of occult metastasis
- Therapeutic nodal dissection – patient has metastatic disease
- If following Imaging, the Tumour is Staged N0 as there is no evidence of Macrometastases on Triple Imaging Scans within Nodes, there can still be Micrometastases within Lymph Nodes (Occult Metastases)
- In this cases, Elective Node Dissection can be carried out to remove any Occult Metastases/Micrometastases that might be present within these nodes to prevent Reocurrence
- If Imaging reveals that the Tumour has Spread to the Lymph Node, Lymph Node removal = Therapeutic Nodal Dissection, where the Affected Lymph Nodes are removed to completely clear the cancer

### Reconstruction

- The Reconstructive Ladder is used to organise the potential methods to reconstruct a region of the body following surgical tumour excision of that body part, with procedures organised from Low to High Complexity (E.g Primary Closure where 2 Sides of the Incision are connected and Free Flap Reconstruction)
- A Flap is a piece of tissue from a donor site that has been moved to a different site in the body and has its own unique blood supply in that area whereas a Graft is a piece of tissue from a donor site that has been moved to a different site in the body and receives its new blood supply from surrounding tissue where it has been reattached
- Grafts are usually very small as they are dependent on revascularisation by the vessels in the close proximity whereas Flaps are often very large as the transplanted tissues have their own blood supply and hence, do not need to share vascularisation with supplying tissue
- Sometimes, Flaps can be conducted from nearby tissues but if a complicated wound needs to be filled, this Flat can be derived from tissue elsewhere in the Body

# Nodes

### Sentinel Node

- The Concept of Sentinel Nodes is mainly used in Melanoma and Breast Cancer
- Lymphatic Channels drain the Primary Tumour and drain to a specific group of Lymph Nodes found near the Tumour, with Sentinel Lymph Nodes being those that directly drain a Tumour via a Single Lymphatic Vessel (First Drains the Tumour)
- Radiotracer Tc-99m is injected around the Tumour, where the tracer is taken up by the tumour and drained by the Lymphatics before becoming stuck within the Sentinel Node that drains the Tumour First, causing it to accumulate here which can be detected using a Gamma Probe to identify Sentinel Nodes, which can be removed to reduce the Risk of Metastases (AKA assess N Stage)

### Elective (Selective Neck Dissection)

- This is where knowledge of Lymphatic Drainage of different regions of the Body can be used to predict where Occult Metastases from a Primary Tumour will be located and hence, which lymph nodes ought to be removed to reduce the risk of Distant Metastases from a tumour

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 14.43.42.png](%5B048%5D%20Surgical%20Oncology%201fb5ffec6c1d40d4977585305231ede7/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_14.43.42.png)

### Therapeutic Nodal Dissection

- Lymph Nodes that are confirmed to have cancerous cells within them are removed to prevent Further Metastases from that tumour around the Body

# Surgical Reconstruction

### Free Flap

- This is performed as it can be designed to suit the Px and their own anatomy/surgery to produce the best cosmetic effects after Surgery, with minimal functional deficits
- This allows tissues elsewhere in the body to replace the tissue found in the region of Interest (E.g Replace Bone in Place A with Bone in Place B)
- It can be technically challenging, it is a long surgery and is Microsurgery, conducted under a miroscope, where vessels within the flap are connected to vessels found at the attachment site

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 14.46.16.png](%5B048%5D%20Surgical%20Oncology%201fb5ffec6c1d40d4977585305231ede7/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_14.46.16.png)

### Radial Forearm Free Flap

- A Radial Forearm free flap is a very common type of Free Flap Reconstruction that is carried out on the Tongue, using skin from the Anterior Forearm
- This region of skin is used as this skin here is soft, thin, mobile and hence, does not tether the tongue to any surounding tissue which would limit the mobility of the tongue (wouldn’t compromise speech)
- Skin on the Anterior Forearm and the Radial Artery and Cephalic Vein supplying the region are isolated while there is Excision of the Tumour on the Tongue
- The Skin from the Forearm is then used to replace the resected segment on the tongue whilst the Radial Artery is attached to branches of the External Carotid Artery that supply the tongue whilst the Cephalic Vein is attached to branches of the Internal Jugular Vein

# Perioperative Care and Advances

### Perioperative Care

- Enhanced recovery programme by attempting to achieve recovery landmarks as early as possible (E.g Mobility and Nutrition) to speed up and hence, inprove recovery
- MDT team usually coordinates the care for the Px following their surgery
- Psychological support – key worker
- Macmillan

### Advances

- iKnife
- Patient specific procedures
- On-table imaging
- Theranostics
- Tissue engineering for reconstruction

### iKnife/Intelligent Knife

- When we excise tissue in theatre, we often use electrocautery vs a Scalpel so that alongside cutting tissue, vessels passing through the region being cut can also be cauterised to prevent bleeding
- iKnife suctions the smoke produced from an Electrocautery Pen when it is used to cut through tissue and passes it through a Mass Spectrometry Device (Rapid Evaporativee Ionisation Mass Spectrometry) to determine whether the smoke from the tissue being cut and hence, the tissue contains cancer cells
- This can be used to determine whether there are cancer cells present at the tumour margins (Smoke analysed by REIMS should be Cancer Free) and hence, whether clear margins have been achieved
- In clinical trials
- Developed by Imperial College

### Patient Specific Staging

- This is where the specific surgical approach selected is based on the Px and the staging of their tumour to maximise the efficacy of the surgery on removing cancer whilst minimising the impacts that it has on a Px’s QoL

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 14.59.30.png](%5B048%5D%20Surgical%20Oncology%201fb5ffec6c1d40d4977585305231ede7/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_14.59.30.png)

### Navigation Surgery

- This is where a radiotracer is injected around a cancer whilst a Px is under General Anaesthetic and Ready for Surgery and a Scan is taken
- The Navigation is then used to tell you the distance between your surgical tool and a feature on the scan (Often the Tumour) so that the margins of the Tumour can be determined in real time

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 15.00.18.png](%5B048%5D%20Surgical%20Oncology%201fb5ffec6c1d40d4977585305231ede7/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_15.00.18.png)

### OSNA - Detection of Occult Metastasis

- This is where a Lymph Node containing tracer following the introduction of the tracer to the tumour (Indicates the Lymph Node drains the tumour) but it is not known whether it contains Occult/Micrometastases
- Here, the Lymph Node is then broken down and mRNA within the Lymph Node is amplified to determine whether there is Cancer within the Lymph Node to indicate the degree of Nodal Involvement regarding the Cancer without the need for additional analysis of Lymph Nodes by Pathologists (AKA Dx is made during the surgery)
- Used in Breast, gastric, colorectal cancer

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 15.02.56.png](%5B048%5D%20Surgical%20Oncology%201fb5ffec6c1d40d4977585305231ede7/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_15.02.56.png)

### Fluorescence Guided Surgery

- This uses Dual Tracers where a radiotracer is used alongside Indocyanine Green - ICG (Fluorescent Tracer) → This allows for Radioactivity to be measured to determine the general area of the Surgical Field that contains the Draining Lymph Node whilst Fluorescence can then be assessed afterwards the specific location of the Draining Lymph Node to ensure that the entirety of the node is resected

**Reconstruction**

- As well as being used as a Lymphatic Tracer to visualise Lymph Nodes, Fluorescence can be introduced into Blood Vessels to assess Perfusion of Flaps to ensure that they are adequate to allow for normal functionality (Ensure Success of Flap)

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 15.05.19.png](%5B048%5D%20Surgical%20Oncology%201fb5ffec6c1d40d4977585305231ede7/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_15.05.19.png)

### Ferronostics

- Cetuximab (mAb vs EGFR which is upregulated by Head and Neck Cancers so Cetuximab preferentially binds to Tumour Cells) can be fluorescently labelled so that wherever Cetuximab binds to Cancer Cells, this region fluoresces to allow for identification of tumour margins to guide surgery to ensure complete tumour resection

# New Realities In Surgery

### Future - Fluorescence Guided Surgery

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 15.06.07.png](%5B048%5D%20Surgical%20Oncology%201fb5ffec6c1d40d4977585305231ede7/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_15.06.07.png)

- The use of Differential Staining of different structures (E.g Nerves, Specific Vessels) using Differently Coloured Fluorescent Dye allows for different structures to be identified during surgery so that structures that are being removed and preserved can be differentiated to minimise complications

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 15.08.02.png](%5B048%5D%20Surgical%20Oncology%201fb5ffec6c1d40d4977585305231ede7/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_15.08.02.png)

- This is where a Px can be scanned to produce an 3D Representation of the Px in AR to enable for better visualisation (external and internal) of the Px and their tumour to allow for more successful tumour resection with fewer complications (E.g allows for better determination of anatomical relations of tumour)
- This can also be used as part of the consenting process to allow a Px to visualise their surgery so that they are better informed before they consent but it can also be used to prepare for surgery by developing surgical plans, testing them and pre-empting complications
