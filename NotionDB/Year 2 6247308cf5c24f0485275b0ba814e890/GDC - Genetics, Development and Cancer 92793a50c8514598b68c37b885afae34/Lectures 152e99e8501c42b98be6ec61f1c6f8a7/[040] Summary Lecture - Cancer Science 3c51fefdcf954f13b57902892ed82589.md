# [040] Summary Lecture - Cancer Science

# Introduction

- Biology of tumourigenesis (cf. Molecular Basis of Cancer).
- Genetic damage and epigenetic alteration
- Multistep process; numerous alterations required which progressively and permanently alter the phenotype of the cell to make it more malignant.
- Prevention (42%). Risk factors.
- Management of cancer (medical, surgical, radiotherapy and Immunotherapy).

---

# Molecular Basis of Cancer

- Proto-oncogenes and TSGs
- Cell transformation; historical experiments
- Epigenetic changes
- Hereditary cancer syndromes

---

# Diagnostic Imaging

- Learn Different modes of imaging and their pros and cons

---

# Tumour Immunology

- Science that underpins a most promising approach to treatment	of	advanced disease.
- Immune surveillance is control mechanism where transformed cells are recognised as non-self via the recognition of Cancer Neoantigens.
- Cellular immunology of tolerance (CTLA-4, PD-1 and mAbs that target these).
- Clinical examples (E.g Malignant Melanoma) and potential adverse	effects.

---

# Cancer Pathology

- Pathologic Types and Nomenclature.
- Role of pathologist in cancer diagnosis and treatment
- Staging and Prognosis (i.e., TNM)
- Excision margins (how path informs treatment).

---

# Viral Aetiology

- Epidemiology	and	importance of	vaccines
- Molecular biology of high risk HPVs
- Cervical cancer case study (Prof Ward)

---

# Personalised Oncology

- Every Px and their cancer is different, often with a different cancer genome
- Small highly-targetted molecules are often used in combination

---

# Tumour Vasculature

- Understand that solid tumours require a blood supply	for continued growth (cf. tumour stroma).
- Physiologic v. pathologic angiogenesis; signalling molecules involved.
- Drugs that target these

---

# Antibody Targeted Therapy

- Bespoke	drugs with high specificity
- Need to know this because not just cancer
- Principles, especially humanisation
- ADC	â€“ specificity
- Herceptin
