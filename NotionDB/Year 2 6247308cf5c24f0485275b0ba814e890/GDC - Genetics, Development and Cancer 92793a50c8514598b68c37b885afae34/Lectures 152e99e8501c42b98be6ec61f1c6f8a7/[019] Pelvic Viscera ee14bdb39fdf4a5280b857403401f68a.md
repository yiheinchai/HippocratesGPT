# [019] Pelvic Viscera

# Pelvic Inlet

- The Pelvic Inlet/Pelvic Brim/Linea Terminalis is formed from:
1. Sacral Promontory (Posteromedially) - Anterior Margin on the Superior Aspect of S1
2. Sacral Ala (Posterolaterally)
3. Iliopectineal Lines (Laterally)
4. Pubic Crest (Anterolaterally)
5. Pubic Symphysis (Anteromedially)
- This divides the False/Greater Pelvis superiorly from the True/Lesser Pelvis Inferiorly
- The Pubic Symphysis is a Secondary Cartilaginous Joint whereas the Sacroiliac Joint is a Synovial Joint whose movement is heavily restricted by Ligaments that bridge the joint space

### Male Vs Female Pelvis

- The Female Pelvis is broader/wider and shallower than the Male Pelvis
- The Ischial Spines of the Female Pelvis do not protrude as far medially [i](http://i.to)nto the Pelvic Cavity as those of the Male Pelvis
- This means that the Pelvic Inlet of the Male Pelvis is more Heart Shaped whereas that of the Female Pelvis is more circular

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2.jpg)

- There are 3 Diameters of Clinical Significance regarding the Pelvic Inlet:
1. Anteroposterior Diameter
2. Transverse Diameter
3. Oblique Diameter

# Pelvic Outlet/Anatomical Perineum

- This is a diamond shaped Outlet formed by:
1. Pubis Symphysis and Body of the Pubis (Anterior Vertex)
2. Ischiopubic Ramus (Anterolaterally)
3. Ischial Tuberosity (Lateral Vertices)
4. Sacrotuberous Ligaments (Posterolateral) - These run between the Ischial Tuberosity and the Coccyx
5. Sacrum and Coccyx (Posterior Vertex)

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2%201.jpg)

- The Ischial Spines can be found extending Medially from the Lateral Aspects of the Pelvic Outlet (Just Posteromedially to the Ischial Tuberosity)

![09_pelvic_outlet.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/09_pelvic_outlet.jpg)

# Angulation of the Pelvis

- In the Anatomical Position, the Pelvic Cavity is Posterosuperiorly orientated (Pubic Symphysis is found Anteroinferiorly)
- The Pelvic Inlet and Outlet are obliquely orientated and at different angles to one another (The Inlet is more Vertical than the Outlet so that the Outlet is 10° from the Horizontal whereas the Inlet is 60° from the Horizontal Plane)
- This differential orientation of the Pelvic Inlet and Outlet means the Pelvic Cavity is Curved Wedge Shape, with the Axis of the Pelvic Cavity curving posteriorly as it runs from the Plane of the Inlet to that of the Outlet
- Due to the curved shape of the Pelvic Cavity and the Pelvic Axis, at different points along the Pelvic Axis, the various Diameters of the Pelvis will be different Sizes

|  | Inlet | Cavity | Outlet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transverse | 13cm | 12cm | 11cm |
| Oblique | 12cm | 13cm | 12cm |
| Anteroposterior | 11cm | 12cm | 13cm |
- As you move from the Pelvic Inlet to the Pelvic Outlet, the Pelvic Cavity is compressed along the Transverse Axis and elongated Anteroposteriorly so that the Pelvis gets narrower but longer as you move Inferiorly through the Pelvis

![B9780443066849500883_gr9.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/B9780443066849500883_gr9.jpg)

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2%202.jpg)

- At the Pelvic Inlet, the Transverse Diameter is the largest of all the Diameters
- Part way between the Pelvic Inlet and Outlet (Within the Pelvic Cavity) the Oblique Diameter is the largest of all the diameters
- At the Pelvic Outlet, the Anteroposterior Diameter is the largest of all Diameters
- As the Foetal Head is longer than it is wide, at the Pelvic Inlet, the Head of the Foetus is orientated in the Coronal Plane as the Transverse Diameter is greatest here.
- As it descends through the Pelvic Cavity, the Foetus rotates so that its Head is now orientated in the Oblique Plane as the Oblique Diameter is greatest here.
- When it reaches the Pelvic Outlet, the Foetus further rotates so that its Head is now orientated in the Sagittal Plane as the Anteroposterior Diameter is greatest here

# Medial Surface of the Hip Bone

- In the Anatomical Position, the ASIS and the Anteror Surface of the Pubis/Pubic Tubercle are in the same Coronal Plane
- The Ischiopubic Ramus is found running anterosuperiorly and medially from the Ischial Tuberosity posteriorly to the Pubic Tubercle anteriorly
- The Superior Pubic Ramus runs Superolaterally and Posteriorly from the Pubic Tubercle to the Medial Surface of the Acetabulum
- The Ischial Spine is crossed by the Pudenal Nerve (The Main Somatic Nerve of the Perineum) which runs inferior to the Ischial Spine as it runs anteriorly into the Perineum
- The Lesser Sciatic Foramen is a gateway from the Gluteal Region to the Perineal Region whereas the Greater Sciatic Foramen is a gateway from the Gluteal Region to the Pelvic Visceral Cavity

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2%203.jpg)

# Pelvic Floor/Diaphragm

- The Obturator Internus lines the Medial Surface of the Obturator Membrane/Foramen, with an Anterior Aperture for the Obturator Canal
- The Obturator Internus is covered Medially by the Obturator Fascia, which is thickened inferiorly to form the Arcus Tendineus/Tendinous Arch which separates the Pelvic Diaphragm inferomedially from the Obturator Internus superolaterally

![3-s2-1.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2-1%201.jpg)

- The Pelvic Visceral Cavity is the region found superior to the Pelvic Diaphragm and Lateral to the Anal Canal whilst the Ischiorectal/Ischioanal Fossae are found inferior to the Pelvic Diaphram and Lateral to Anal Canal
- The Rectum is found Superior to the Pelvic Diaphragm whereas the Anus is found Inferior to the Pelvic Diaphragm
- In the Lateral Aspect of the Ischiorectal/Ischioanal Fossa, the Pudenal/Alcock’s Canal can be found running in the Sagittal Plane through the Obturator Fascia
- This Canal contains:
1. Pudendal Nerve
2. Internal Pudendal Artery and Vein
3. Nerve to Obturator Internus

![ARF_isch_fossa_anat_edt.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/ARF_isch_fossa_anat_edt.jpg)

![1-s2.0-B9780444639547000380-f38-12-9780444639547.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/1-s2.0-B9780444639547000380-f38-12-9780444639547.jpg)

### Pelvic Diaphragm/Floor

- This is a Sheet of muscle that supports the pelvic viscera (when it
contracts) while allowing objects to pass out of the pelvis (when it relaxes) and into the Abdominal Cavity superiorly or Perineum inferiorly
- It is composed of Levator Ani and Coccygeus
- Levator ani is often described as having 3 different parts, moving laterally, depending on where the fibres arise from (These Distinctions are not clinically significant):
1. Puborectalis
2. Pubococcygeus
3. Iliococcygeus
- Puborectalis of levator ani which wraps around the posterior aspect of the anorectal junction is important for maintaining Fecal Continence by contracting to pull the Junction Anteriorly to make a kink/angle in the Rectum to support Continence

### Female Pelvic Floor

- The Sacrospinous Ligament runs more horizontally than the Sacrotuberous Ligament and runs medially from the Ischial Spine to the Sacrum, crossing the anterior surface of the Sacrotuberous Ligament
- The Sacrospinous Ligament runs along the posterior Surface of the Coccygeus, which it is continuous with anteriorly and hence, these structures are considered to be continuous with one another
- Levator Ani arises from the Posterior Surface of the Pelvis medially (minor) and Obturator Internus Fascia/Arcus Tendineus Laterally (major), with these muscle fibres running inferomedially to form a Muscular Sling/Hammock
- The Anterior Fibres of Levator Ani (Arise Medially) that run almost sagitally/posteriorly are separated in the midline by the Urogenital Hiatus, through which the Vagina Passes
- The Urethra descends closely related to the Vagina, on the external surface of its anterior wall
- Just Posterior to the Vagina, between the Urogenital Hiatus anteriorly and the Rectus Hiatus posteriorly is the Perineal Body/Obstetric Perineum - This is a fibromuscular mass into which many fibres of the Levator Ani insert and hence, is important in maintaining the Stability of the Perineum, notably in women
- The Majority of the Anterior Fibres of Levator Ani insert into the Perineal Body however, more posterior Fibres from Levator Ani insert onto the Anococcygeal Raphé
- The Anococcygeal Raphé is a Tendinous Raphe found in the Midline between the Anorectal Junction/Rectal Hiatus anteriorly and the Sacrum/Coccyx Posteriorly
- The Puborectalis Component of Levator Ani arises just superior to the rest of Levator Ani and run posteromedially to run around the Posterior Aspect of the Anorectal Junction

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2%204.jpg)

![3-s2-1.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2-1%202.jpg)

### Importance of the Pelvic Diaphragm

- As Humans are Bipedal Hominids, meaning that Humans walk on Two Legs, having bipedal locomotion and bipedal posture
- The main advantage is that it uses less energy to stand and move around using 2 limbs vs 4 limbs like quadripeds whilst also freeing the upper limbs to carry out alternate functions during Locomotion and Standing
- The main disadvantage is that it Bipedal Locomotion causes the Pelvis to become narrowed, making it more difficult to pass the foetus through the Pelvic Cavity during Birth and as the upright posture means that the Pelvic Viscera would fall out of their anatomical position due to gravity without any support from beneath
- From Evolution from Quadripeds to Bipeds, muscles that wag the tail have been adapted to form the Pelvic Diaphragm which fill in the Pelvic Outlet to support the Pelvic Viscera from beneath to prevent it from falling through the Pelvic Outlet

# Superior View of Female Pelvic Floor

- From Posterior to Anterior, the Rectum, Vagina and Proximal Aspect of the Urethra/Neck of the Urinary Bladder are found passing through the Pelvic Diaphragm
- When the Pelvic Floor contracts, it pulls these structure superoanteriorly, creating a kink within these tubes to aid Rectal and Urinary Continence as well as Prolapse of the Rectum and Vagina inferiorly through the Urogenital and Rectal Hiatuses onto the external surface of the body
- The motor nerve supply to the pelvic diaphragm is mainly by direct
branches from the sacral plexus (mainly ventral rami of S3,S4) which run inferoanteriorly to pass through the superior surface of the Pelvic Floor to innervate it.
- There is an branch to the Puborectalis (part of levator ani) which ascends from the pudendal nerve found inferiorly, but whether this is motor or sensory is controversial.
- The Pelvic Floor is one of the most frequently damaged and weakened muscles, mainly in women due to numerous pregnancies, particularly when forceps are used, causing direct damage to the Pelvic Floor or to its nerves, where Denervation of the Pelvic Floor causes it to atrophy.
- Pudendal nerve block affects the external anal sphincter and sometimes the pelvic diaphragm, but the pudendal nerve and the nerve to the pelvic diaphragm from above are only 5mm apart.

# Male Pelvic Viscera

- When Empty, the Urinary Bladder is found posterior to the Pubis
- Its Apex is points anteriorly, relatively flat roof and its base is found posteriorly
- The Urethra is connected to the Bladder via the Bladder Neck (found just superior to the Prostate), which contains the Bladder Neck Sphincter/Internal Urethral Sphincter which is made of smooth muscle
- The Prostate is found just inferior to and in contact with the Base/Neck of the Bladder and surrounds the urethra
- The space between the prostate posteriorly and the Pubis anteriorly forms the Retropubic Space, which contains the Prostatic Venous Plexus and is commonly used as a surgical approach to access the Prostate Gland
- Just inferior to the Prostate Gland is the External Urethral Sphincter (Circular Skeletal Muscle Sphincter), which extends into and is continuous with the Muscle of the Prostate
- The Region of the Urethra that passes through the Prostate = Prostatic Urethra and the Region of Urethra that passes through the External Urethral Sphincter = Membraneous Urethra
- The Region of the Urethra that passes through the Penis (From the External Urethral Sphincter Proximally and the External Urethral Orifice Distally) is known as the Spongy/Penile Urethra

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2%205.jpg)

- The Anorectal Canal is found just posterior to the Prostate, which allows the Prostatic Enlargement to be identified as the Prostate can be palpated through the Rectum by pressing Anteriorly at the Anorectal Junction
- The Peritoneum descends down the Anterior Abdominal Wall, posteriorly along the roof of the bladder and inferiorly along the Base of the Bladder before being reflected to run superiorly along the Anterior Border of the Rectum
- Where the Peritoneum descends posterior to the Bladder before reflecting on itself to ascend anterior to the Rectum, this forms the Rectovesical Pouch

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2%206.jpg)

# Pelvic Veins

- There are venous plexuses around the pelvic viscera.
- They have no valves and are thin walled and hence, can produce large haemorrhages when damaged in pelvic trauma.
- Vesicle and prostatic venous plexuses drain to internal iliac veins
and vertebral venous plexus.
- The Vertebral Venous Plexi are drained by segmental veins at each level and are continuous along the length of the Spinal Cord to drain into the Intracranial Venous Sinuses
- Therefore, prostate cancer often spreads to the vertebrae via the Prostatic Venous Plexus into the Vertebral Venous Plexus

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2%207.jpg)

# Female Pelvic Viscera

- Whilst the Bladder is found in the same position in women as it is in men with the same anatomical features, there is no Prominent Internal Urethral Sphincter
- Along the more distal aspect aspect of the Urethra, the Skeletal Muscle External Urethral Sphincter can be found
- The Female Urethra is attached to the External Surface of the Anterior Vaginal Wall, with the Anterior and Posterior Walls of the Vagina often being in contact with one another
- The Uterus can be seen extending into the Proximal/Superior Aspect of the Vagina, causing the Proximal End of the Vagina to be concave
- The Anterior, Posterior and Lateral Fornices are formed by where the vaginal canal extends superiorly to surround the Cervix, forming a ring
- The Posterior Fornix is covered by Peritoneum on its Posterior Surface, which reflects to ascend along the Rectum, forming the Rectouterine Pouch/Pouch of Douglas between the Posterior Vaginal Fornix anteriorly and the Sigmoid Colon posteriorly
- The Rectouterine Pouch is a common site for Infection and Malignant Cells to accumulate when stood upright as it is one of the most inferior Peritoneal Pouches, which can then be sampled by passing a needle posteriorly through the Posterior Fornix to enter the Rectouterine Pouch
- In Women, the Peritoneum descends down the Anterior Abdominal Wall and runs along the Roof of the Bladder
- It is then reflected to run anteriorly along the Inferior surface of the Uterus to then run posteriorly along its superior surface to reach the Posterior Vaginal Fornix
- Where the Peritoneum is reflected onto the Inferior Surface of the Uterus, the Vesicouterine Pouch can be found inferior to the Uretus and Superior to the Bladder

# Arteries to the Pelvis

- The Internal Iliac Artery arises from the Bifurcation of the Common Iliac Artery and runs posteriorly to supply the Pelvic Viscera and Walls
- The Median Sacral Artery is a small artery arises from the Posterior Surface of the Bifurcation of the Abdominal Aorta (At the Level of L4) and descends along the Anterior Surface of the Sacrum to contribute to the blood supply of the Pelvis
- It is related to Presacral Lymph Nodes
- The Lateral Sacral Arteries are small branches of the Internal Iliac Artery and descend along the anterior surface of the Sacrum where they contribute to the Blood Supply of the Pelvis whilst supplying the Sacral Nerve Roots
- Where the Inferior Mesenteric Artery crosses the Pelvic Brim/Pelvic Inlet, it forms the Superior Rectal Artery and supplies the majority of the Rectum and Anal Canal

![3-s2-1.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2-1%205.jpg)

- As the Internal Iliac Artery/IIA enters the Pelvic Cavity, it bifurcates into an Anterior and Posterior Division
- The Umbilical Artery arises from the Anterior Division of the IIA and in the Foetus, it is a large artery that carries Foetal Blood to the Placenta via the Umbilical Cord
- At Birth, the Majority of the Umbilical Artery becomes obliterated but it remains patent until it reaches the Anterior Border of the Bladder
- Just proximal to where the Umbilical Artery ends, it gives off the Superior Vesicle Arteries that descend to supply the Superior Aspect of the Bladder
- The Inferior Vesicle Artery (sometimes 2) arises from the Anterior Division of the IIA and descends posterior to the Bladder to supply the Inferior Aspect of the Bladder, Lower Ureter and the Prostate
- The Internal Pudenal Artery arises from the Anterior Division of the Internal Iliac Artery and is the main blood supply to the Perineum
- It emerges laterally from the Pelvic Cavity through the Greater Sciatic Foramen (Above Coccygeus/Sacrospinous Ligament) and then descends to run medially, entering the Perineum via the Lesser Sciatic Foramen

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2%2010.jpg)

![3-s2-1.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2-1%206.jpg)

- Superior and Inferior Gluteal Arteries arise from the Posterior Division of the IIA
- General Rule - The Branches of the Posterior Division of the IIA mainly supplies the walls of the Pelvic Cavity and the Branches of the Posterior Division of the IIA mainly supplies the Pelvic Viscera

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2%2011.jpg)

- In Women, the Uterine Artery arises from the Anterior Division of the Internal Iliac Artery and runs laterally, posterior to the Ureter before wrapping around the Ureter to run inferomedially (crossing the Anterior Surface of the Ureter) to reach the Uterus
- The Ureter enters the Pelvic Cavity by crossing over the Anterior Surface of the Bifurcation of the Common Carotid Artery
- This is Pass/Fail Knowledge

# Female Reproductive System

- The Lower 1/3rd of the Uterus = Cervix and the Upper 2/3rd of the Uterus = Body
- The Roof of the Uterus is curved superiorly to form the Fundus
- The Cervical Canal is narrow, passing through the Cervix to open up into the Triangular Shaped Uterine Lumen
- The Uterine Lumen is very narrow in the Coronal Plane so the Anterior and Posterior Walls of the Uterus are often in contact with one another
- The Lateral Vertices of the Uterine Lumen form the Uterine Cornu and this is where the Uterine Lumen is continuous with the Uterine/Fallopian Tubes, which run laterally
- The Intramural Region of the Uterine Tube is very narrow and is where the Uterine Tubes pass through the Wall of the Uterus
- Just lateral to the Intramural Region of the Uterine Tube, the Uterine Tube narrows again to form the Isthmus
- Lateral/Distal to the Isthmus of the Uterine Tube, the Uterine Tube widens to form the Ampulla, which curves, ending medially as the Infundibulum, which is open to the Peritoneal Cavity (Allowing Infections to track between the Uterus and Peritoneal Cavity)
- Around the Opening of the Infundibulum, Fimbriae are found, with some Fimbriae found in contact with the Ovary
- The Cervix has a superior and inferior narrowing where it is continuous with the Uterine Lumen/Cavity and Vagina respectively, forming the Internal and External Os
- When viewed with a Speculum, the Cervix is Doughnut Shaped, surrounded Peripherally by the Vaginal Fornices
- If a woman has not had Children, the External Os appears circular but if a woman has had children, the External Os appears narrower (Slit-Like)
- Just Superior to the Internal Os, the Uterine Cavity is narrowed to form the Isthmus of the Uterine Cavity, also known as the Lower Uterine Segment when a woman is pregnant.

![3-s2.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2%2014.jpg)

![3-s2-1.jpg](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/3-s2-1%204.jpg)

- The Ovaries are suspended from the Inferior Surface of the Cornu of the Uterus by the Ovarian Ligament, which is an Embryonic Remnant of the Gubernaculum which guides the Descent of the Ovaries and Testes from their Origin in the Posterior Abdominal Wall into their adult position
- Whilst the Inferior Remnant of the Gubernaculum is formed by the Ovarian Ligament, the Superior Remant is the Round Ligament of the Uterus, which is a flat connective tissue sheet that is connected to Superior Surface of the Cornu of the Uterus
- It runs superolaterally to pass through the Deep and Superficial Inguinal Rings and ends in the Labia Majora in the Perineum

![Screenshot 2022-03-05 at 16.07.36.png](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/Screenshot_2022-03-05_at_16.07.36.png)

- The Broad Ligament of the Uterus is a doubled layered sheet of Peritoneum that surrounds the Uterine Tubes

![Screenshot 2022-03-05 at 16.17.44.png](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/Screenshot_2022-03-05_at_16.17.44.png)

- The Ovary is attached to the Posterior Layer of the Broad Ligament and where is surrounds the Ovary, it forms the Germinal Epithelium
- During Ovulation, an ovum erupts through the Germinal Epithelium into the Peritoneal Cavity, where Fimbriae waft it into the Ostium at the Distal End of the Uterine Tubes
- The Broad Ligament is formed by Peritoneum which ascends from the Floor of the Peritoneal Cavity and Loops over and surrounds the Uterine Tube, spanning the Space between the Uterine Tubes and the Floor of the Peritoneal Cavity
- The Region of the Broad Ligament above the Ovarian Ligament is the Mesosalpinx (Smaller Portion) and the Region of the Broad Ligament below the Ovarian Ligament is known as the Mesometrium (Larger Portion)
- Laterally, the Broad Ligament continues to reach the Lateral Wall of the Pelvic Cavity to form the Suspensory Ligament of the Ovary between the Infundibulum of the Uterine Tube and the Lateral Pelvic Wall

# Section Through The Broad Ligament

- The Uterine Tube is found embedded in the Superior Aspect of the Broad Ligament/Mesosalpinx
- The Anastamosis between the Ovarian and Uterine Arteries is found just inferior to the Uterine Tube, embedded within the Mesosalpinx
- The Uterine Artery is found running through the Base of the Broad Ligament, inferior to its Bifurcation and superior to the Ureter

### Hysterosalpingogram

- Used to Test the Patency of the Uterine Tubes as the Peritoneal Cavity and hence, the Uterine Tubes are open cavities via the External Os
- Radioopaque Dye is injected into the Uterus and runs along the Uterine Tubes
- Normally (when the Uterine Tubes are not occluded), the Tracer will leave the Uterine Tubes via the Ostium of the Uterine Tubes to enter the Peritoneal Cavity
- If the Uterine Tubes are blocked, the Dye will not enter the Peritoneal Cavity, with the region where the Dye is last seen indicating the site of the Blockage within the Uterine Tubes
- However, there have been cases where a woman with a single ovary, found on the side where there is a Blocked Uterine Tube, was able to get pregnant, indicating that the Ovum is able to diffuse large distances across the Width of the Peritoneal Cavity to enter the Unblocked Uterine Tube to allow Pregnancy to be maintained

# Anastomosis of the Uterine and Ovarian Arteries Within the Broad Ligament

- The Ovarian Artery runs medially through the Lateral Part of the Broad Ligament/Mesometrium (Suspensory Ligament of the Ovary) to enter the Superior Aspect of the Mesometrium
- The Ovarian Artery supplies the Ovary and Uterine Tube before descending down the lateral wall of the Uterus
- The Uterine Artery runs superomedially across the Floor of the Pelvic Visceral Cavity, before ascending up the Lateral Wall of the Uterus (within the Broad Ligament), giving off branches which run medially to supply the Uterus
- These branches are highly coiled to prevent them from Rupturing when the Uterus Expands during Pregnancy
- When the Uterine Artery reaches the Inferior Surface of the Uterine Cornu, it runs laterally along the Inferior Surface of the Uterine Tube, where it anastomoses with the Ovarian Artery
- The Uterine Artery also gives off small branches to supply the Medial Aspect of the Ovary
- The Uterine Artery crosses the Anterior Surface of the Ureter within the Broad Ligament near the Lateral Fornix of the Vagina or Lateral to the Supravaginal Canal

# Contents of the Broad Ligament

1. Uterine tube
2. Anastomosis of uterine and ovarian arteries
3. Ligament of ovary
4. Part of round ligament of uterus
5. Remnants of embryonic structures- have oophoron in name (only importance is that they sometimes form cysts)

# Arterial Supply to the Female Reproductive Tract

- Before the Uterine Artery crosses the Anterior Surface of the Ureter, it gives off a branch that descends to supply the Superior Apsect of the Vagina
- The Vaginal Artery arises from either the Uterine Artery of IIA and supplies the Majority of the Vagina, notably the Middle Aspect
- Sometimes, the Middle Rectal Artery gives off small branches to contribute to the blood supply of the Middle of the Vagina
- The Internal Pudenal Artery supplies the Inferior Aspect of the Vagina as this region of the Vagina is in the Perineum
- Branches of these arteries join anastomose with the two median longitudinal vessels, the azygos arteries of the vagina, which run along the anterior and posterior walls of the vagina in the Sagittal Plane

# Expansion of the Uterus During Pregnancy and Obturator Nerve

### Pregnancy

- During Pregnancy, the Uterus can expand significantly, increasing its mass up to 20x, which means the Uterine Vessels must also expand to a similar degree to prevent Necrosis of the Enlarged Uterus during Pregnancy
- However, whilst the Uterus is well adapted for this expansion during Pregnancy, the Uterine Tubes are not
- Therefore, when an Ectopic Pregnancy occurs within the Uterine Tubes, these tubes can rupture and cause a massive Haemorrhage from the Ovarian Artery

### Obturator Nerve

- As it Descends to reach the Medial Compartment of the Thigh, the Obturator Nerve is found just medial to the Ovaries

# Support For the Uterus

- If the Structures that support the Uterus lose their integrity, the Uterus moves inferiorly to extend into the Vagina and sometimes, through the External Os onto the External Surface of the Body (Uterine Prolapse)

![Screenshot 2022-03-05 at 17.00.53.png](%5B019%5D%20Pelvic%20Viscera%20ee14bdb39fdf4a5280b857403401f68a/Screenshot_2022-03-05_at_17.00.53.png)

### Supports for the Uterus

1. Pelvic Diaphragm 
2. Ligaments (Thickenings of Pelvic Fascia that are attached to the Uterine Cervix)
- From Lateral → Medial, these Ligaments are the Cardinal Ligaments, Pubocervical (Anteromedially) and Uterosacral (Posteromedially) Ligaments
- From Strongest → Weakest, these Ligaments are the Cardinal Ligaments, Uterosacral Ligaments and Pubocervical Ligaments
- Prolapse of uterus can occur if the pelvic diaphragm is weakened
(which will present alongside urinary and faecal incontinence)

- Pubocervical Ligaments attach the anterior surface of the Cervix to the Inner Surface of the Pubis, passing lateral to the Bladder
- Cardinal Ligaments are the Largest of the Ligaments and attach the Lateral Surface of the Uterus to the Lateral Pelvic Walls
- These are Thickenings of the Fascia surrounding the Visceral Branches from the IIA (Mainly Anterior Division) like the Uterine Artery etc.
- The Uterosacral Ligaments attach the Posterior Surface of the Uterus to the Inner Aspect of the Sacrum, passing lateral to the Rectum
- These Ligaments are found superior to the Pelvic Diaphragm and the Cardinal and Uterosacral Ligaments are the strongest
