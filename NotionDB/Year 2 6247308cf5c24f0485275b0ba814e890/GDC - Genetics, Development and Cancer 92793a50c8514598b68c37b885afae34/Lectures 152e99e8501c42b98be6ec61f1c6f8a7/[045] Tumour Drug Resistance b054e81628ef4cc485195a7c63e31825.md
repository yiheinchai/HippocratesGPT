# [045] Tumour Drug Resistance

# Cost and Benefit Mismatch

- Primary Tumours are usually Rx via Surgery but when a Tumour has metastasised, it is usually Rx with Systemic Therapy - However, whilst showing initial effectiveness, these therapies often fail as tumours develop resistance to the Rx
- The cost of cancer drugs is rising but there has not be proportional increases in survival from Cancer
- Between 2009-2013, the EMA approved 48 cancer drugs for 68 indications
- However, only in 24 (35%) out of the 68 indications was there was evidence of significant prolongation of survival
- Median overall survival benefit from these Rx was 2.7 months
- Of those where there was no evidence of survival benefit, 5/44 (11%) reported benefit in quality of life
- This meant that the drug development cost per life year saved = $2.7 million
- These current strategies are not sustainable due to their increased cost but small beneficial effects

### Precision Medicine and CML

- Precision Medicine is a strategy to Rx a Px’s Cancer based on the specific Mutational Profile of that Tumour
- This requires Diagnostic Testing to select optimal therapies based on Genomic, Molecular or Cellular Analysis
- CML is an example of where the successful identification of BCR-ABL Fusion Gene via Genomic Analysis has identified a Drug Target for Imatinib which has been used to Rx the Tumour to significantly increase Survival Rate (31 → 89% Survival after 5 Years)
- It is commonly the case that without Precision Medicine, the application of a specific Rx to cure the same Tumour Type in a wide population will lead to Benefit in some Px, No Benefit in other Px and adverse effects in Some Px whereas with Precision Medicine, the analysis of the Genome of the Tumour in the Specific Px allows for Rx to be tailored to the specific mutational profile of the Cancer, maximising effectiveness for all Px
- However, this is oversimplified as not every identified unique Mutation within the Cancer Genome can be targeted via Rx, the effect of the Rx on the Target varies in different organs, the Tumour Microenvironment and Immune System alter the effectiveness of the Rx

# Drug Resistance

### Clinical

- Usually defined radiologically, sometimes clinically
- Primary (intrinsic) resistance: The tumour continues to grow and spread in spite of therapy (defined as disease progression) as it is resistant to the Rx from the Start
- Secondary (acquired) resistance: The tumour stops growing (or shrinks) and spreading (defined as stable diseases/partial response or complete response) as it initially responds to the Rx, but subsequently resumes growth (defined as disease progression)

### Molecular

- Usually defined by the mechanism of resistance
- Intrinsic (de novo) drug resistance: Resistance-mediating factors pre-exist in the tumour cells
- Acquired drug resistance: Develops during therapy where tumour cells are initially sensitive and subsequently acquire mutations which cause them to become resistant to therapy

### Primary Resistance

- Between 2 Time Points, there is a constant progression of the Cancer (Rx was not effective initially and therefore, Resistance is Primary)

### Secondary Resistance

- Px initially showed improvement with the Rx (Reduction in Number and Size of Lesions) but then Tumour developed Secondary Resistance, causing Tumour to grow and spread following the acquisition of Resistance, often to a worse phenotype than was seen Pre Rx

# Intratumour Heterogeneity

- This is the idea that there are Genomic, Transcriptomic and Epigenomic Differences between the same type of tumour, found in different Pxs (Intertumour Heterogeneity)
- Intratumour Heterogeneity = Concept that there are Genomic, Transcriptomic and Epigenomic Differences between the cells within one tumour within an individual so that one tumour contains many different populations of cells with a different Genomic Background
- Subclonal Mutations are the mutations that are unique to a specific population of Cells within a Tumour that shows Genetic Heterogeneity and hence, are used to define that subpopulation of cells
- Clonal Mutations are the mutations that are found in all the subpopulation of cells with different Genomic Profiles within a Tumour that shows Genetic Heterogeneity

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 12.18.17.png](%5B045%5D%20Tumour%20Drug%20Resistance%20b054e81628ef4cc485195a7c63e31825/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_12.18.17.png)

### Evolution

- From Sampling Multiple Regions of a Tumour showing Heterogeneity at Primary and Metastatic Sites, it is possible to establish a Phylogenetic Tree to track the Evolution of the Tumour and its Genetic Profile over Time and how it accumulates various Mutations to produce a tumour with Genetic Heterogeneity
- Clonal Mutations that are common to all cells must have occurred early in Oncogenesis as due to the Single Cell Origin of All Tumours, when a Cell proliferates, it passes on its Mutation to its Daughter Cells so the presence of a Common Mutation in All Cells means it occurred when there were few cells present in the Tumour
- Subclonal Mutations that are localised to a small subset of Cells (E.g Unique to Primary or Metastatic Sample) must have occurred later in Oncogenesis as their presence in a smaller proportion of cells means that they originated when many cells were present in the Tumour
- Shared Primary Mutations are Mutations that are found in All Samples of the Primary Tumour but not in any Metastatic Lesions whereas Shared Metastatic Mutations are those only found in All Samples of the Metastatic Lesions but not in the Primary Tumour
- Private Mutations are those mutations that are found only in 1 Sample
- The fewer sample/cells that a mutation is found in, the later in Oncogenesis it occurred whereas the more cells it is found in, the earlier in Oncogenesis it occurred
- Phylogenetic Tree (Earliest to Latest Mutation) from Mutations = Clonal → Shared Primary & Shared Metastatic → Private
- Therefore, the development of Phylogenetic Trees allows for:
1. The determination of Clonal Mutations which can be targeted by Drugs to allow for destruction of all the cells within a Tumour to maximise the effectiveness of a Rx
2. Identification of Genetic Mutations that allow cells to become Metastatic (Usually Shared Metastatic Mutations), allowing these mutations to be targeted by Rx to prevent Metastases

- Branched Evolution = Idea that Multiple Distinct Subpopulations of Cells will arise from a Single Malignant Cell within a Tumour due to the acquisition of different mutations within each subpopulation
- Parallel Evolution = The acquisition of identical/similar mutations (E.g Different Mutation but same effect on Gene/Protein Function) in different Subpopulations of Cells within a Tumour independently from one another
- 65% of Mutations found in Tumour Cells are Heterogenous and not present in every biopsy. This means that when taking multiple tumour biopsies, it is important that you assess multiple different regions for Mutations so that a mutation is not classified as Clonal  and hence, incorrectly selected as an effective drug target when it is actually Subclonal
- Due to this high degree of Hetergeneity, this also means that some key mutations can be missed if not enough samples from a wide variety of tumour regions are sampled as these mutations may be present in non-sampled regions

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 12.19.02.png](%5B045%5D%20Tumour%20Drug%20Resistance%20b054e81628ef4cc485195a7c63e31825/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_12.19.02%201.png)

### Branched Evolution in ccRCC

- If the Phylogenetic Tree of a Tumour has a short main trunk (Containing Few Clonal Mutations) with many different branching events (Many Subclonal Mutations), this indicates that there are many subclonal Populations within the Tumour and hence, there is a high degree of Intratumour Heterogeneity
- If there is a Phylogenetic Tree from a Tumour with a long main trunk (Many Clonal Mutations) with few branching events (Few Subclonal Mutations), this indicates that there are few subclonal populations within the Tumour and hence, there is a low degree of Intratumour Heterogeneity
- There are Many Driver Mutations that are missed/not seen in a Single Tumour Biopsy, meaning that a large proportion of Driver Mutations are Subclonal, with different combinations of Subclonal Drivers found in different Px depending on the Subclonal Populations found within that Px

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 11.12.11.png](%5B045%5D%20Tumour%20Drug%20Resistance%20b054e81628ef4cc485195a7c63e31825/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_11.12.11.png)

### Genetic Heterogeneity May Affect the Same Protein Complex In Different Branches

- Parallel Evolution affecting a Single Protein Complex means that Different Mutations at multiple different steps within a Single Biochemical Pathway may lead to the same selective advantage/effect in a tumour cell
- This can give rise to Genetic Heterogeneity as whilst multiple cells have different mutations to subunits in the same protein complex, all these different mutations cause the Protein Complex to become dysfunctional to produce the same selective advantage/effect

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 11.18.46.png](%5B045%5D%20Tumour%20Drug%20Resistance%20b054e81628ef4cc485195a7c63e31825/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_11.18.46.png)

- In Non Small Cell Lung Cancer, there is usually around 5 Subclonal Populations per tumour

# Cause of Intratumour Heterogeneity - Microevolution

- Intratumour Heterogeneity arises due to Genomic Instability at the Nucleotide and/or Chromosomal Level

### Gradualism

- Darwin argued that nature never makes jumps : natura non facit saltum
- Profound Genetic change is the result of a slow but continuous processes
- Gradual accumulation of small mutations like Small Nucleotide Variants/SNVs which act as drivers of change (Neo-Darwinism)
- This process of Gradual Change at the Nucleotide Level can be seen in Mutational Signatures (Assigning Certain Specific Mutations to certain Mutagenic Processes such as UV Light)
- E.g UV Light causes predominantly C→T Mutations whereas Smoking causes C→A Mutations

### Hopeful Monsters

- Goldschmidt argued that large changes in evolution were caused by “macromutations”
- These were Chromosomal rearrangements that occur early in Tumour Evolution and result in Macroevolutionary leap, causing profound changes that often led to Speciation where 2 populations formed by the Chromosomal Mutation were significantly different due to significant alterations in gene dosage between the Mutated and Non Mutated Population producing significant phentypic alterations
- “Macroevolution must proceed by a different genetic method…. Only the arrangement of the serial chemical constituents of the chromosome into a new, spatially different order; ie. A new chromosomal pattern, is involved”
- Often these Large Chromosomal Mutations alter Gene Dosage so significantly that they cause Apoptosis but sometimes, they provide a Cell with a Survival Advantage, leading to Malignant Transformation

---

# Pattern of Cancer Chromosomal Rearrangements

- Chromosomal Instability can be divided into:
1. Structural → Alterations to Chromosomal Structure via Deletions/Additions/Transversions without altering the Number of Chromosomes in a Cell
2. Numerical → Alterations to the Number of Chromosomes in a Cell (E.g Aneuploidy)
3. Chromoplexy and Chromothripsis → This is where Chromosomes are fragmented and then reassembled to form Irregular Chromosomes, comprised of Genes derived from Multiple different Chromosomes

# Treatment and Studies

### Problems of Intergenetic Heterogeneity in Rx of Cancer

- Branched Genetic Events/Mutations are Present in Some Cancer Cells not others (Subclonal Mutations)
- These mutations are dynamic and constantly changing during disease course relative to what proportion of cells have a specific mutation
- Due to this Genetic Heterogeneity, it is important to monitor subclonal mutations that can give rise of Drug Resistance Mechanisms that reduce the effectiveness of a Rx
- Subclonal Mutations that give rise to Rx Resistance that means when there is a selection pressure of the Rx (E.g Px is receiving Rx), the Sensitive Cells will die whilst the Resistant Cells will not, allowing them to survive and proliferate significantly due to reduced competition, allowing for the rapid development of a resistant tumour
- Trunk Genetic Events are Present in Every Cancer Cell (Clonal Mutations)
- It is important to Define and Target Trunk/Clonal Drivers so that Rx can be active against all tumour cells, not just a subset of cells to maximise the effectiveness of the Rx to prevent the development of a Resistant Tumour from a small subset of Resistant Cells
- Driver Gene Mutations are often Subclonal Mutations found in a subset of Cells within a Tumour but not within all cells and therefore, these mutations cannot be selected as effective Drug Rx as they would not target all the tumour cells, only the subclonal population that contain the driver mutation

### DARWIN Clinical Trial Program - Targeting Clonally Dominant Mutations

- Targeting Clonal Driver Mutations allow for All Cells within a Tumour to be targeted by a Rx and hence, allows for more effective Rx by preventing the development of Rx-Resistant Tumours via the Proliferation of Cancer Cells that were not targeted by the Rx

### EGFR TKI Resistance Non Small Cell Lung Cancer

- There are many resistance mechanisms against EGFR TKIs seen in NSCLC but there are minor subclone populations within NSCLC with the T90 Mutations that have been identified in Tumours of Px who have not yet received Rx
- As a very small proportion of Tumours have this T90 Mutations, Conventional Methods of Genomic Analysis to detect Subclonal Populations are unable to identify the T90 Population when analysing a Large Number of Cells from a Tumour → Here, NGS is needed to identify the T90 Subclonal Population

### Targeted Therapy Resistance

- NSCLC Cells with the T790M Mutation are usually vary sparce within a Genetically Heterogenous NSCLC but as the Tumour is Rx with Erlotinib and sensitive cells die, Cells with the T790M Mutation who are resistant proliferate and contribute a greater % of the Tumour, eventually becoming the dominant clone → Secondary Molecular and Clinical Resistance

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 12.10.55.png](%5B045%5D%20Tumour%20Drug%20Resistance%20b054e81628ef4cc485195a7c63e31825/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_12.10.55.png)

### Immune Checkpoint Inhibition

- Neoantigens are Tumour Specific Ag expressed on the MHC Class II Complex of Cancerous Cells
- They are Recognised by The TCR and Stimulate a T Cell Response Vs the Cancerous Cell to help destroy the Cancer
- Neoantigens are a product of Mutations that are acquired as the Tumour Cell proliferates and as a result, Neoantigens can be Clonal or Subclonal depending on whether they are expressed on all cells or only a subset of cells found within a specific tumour
- As the Proportion of Clonal Neoantigens expressed on the Surface of a Tumour showing Genetic Heterogeneity Increases, the duration of the therapeutic effect provided by the Rx against the Neoantigen increases as there are fewer cells that do not express the Ag and hence, are able to avoid the immune system and proliferate to cause Cancer Progression and development of Resistant Tumours
- Therefore, Cancer Cells that express mainly Clonal Neoantigens are very effectively Rx by Checkpoint Inhibitors/The Immune System whereas Cancer Cells that express Subclonal Neoantigens are more able to avoid Immune Detection in response to Rx, allowing these cells to proliferate and form a Rx-Resistant Tumour

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 12.13.12.png](%5B045%5D%20Tumour%20Drug%20Resistance%20b054e81628ef4cc485195a7c63e31825/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_12.13.12.png)

- There are Tumours with a low ability to avoid immune destruction, containing many Tumour Infiltrating Lymphocytes that recognise Neoantigens, No Loss of HLA (allowing Neoantigens to be presented to the Immune System) and No Mutation to Machinery involved in Ag Processing and Presentation
- There are Tumours with a high ability to avoid/evade immune destruction containing few Infiltrating Lymphocytes, Loss of HLA or Immune Editing and Mutations to Ag Processing/Presentation
- Mortality associated with Tumours with a Low Ability to Avoid Immune Destruction is much less than that associated with Tumours with a High Ability to Avoid Immune Destruction

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 12.20.18.png](%5B045%5D%20Tumour%20Drug%20Resistance%20b054e81628ef4cc485195a7c63e31825/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_12.20.18.png)

- By Sequencing Multiple Regions of a Tumour, it is possible to predict Clonal Neoantigens that can be recognised by T Cells and culture these Neoantigens with Dendritic Cells and T Cells derived for Px
- T Cells that are activated and specific to the Neoantigen are Isolated, Stimulated via Culturing alongside Dendritic Cells and are then expanded/proliferated to form a Large Population of T Cells which are then reintroduced into the Px that are specific against the Clonal Cancer Neoantigen

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 12.25.01.png](%5B045%5D%20Tumour%20Drug%20Resistance%20b054e81628ef4cc485195a7c63e31825/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_12.25.01.png)

### TRACERx Study

- Following a Dx of NSCLC, Px receive routine care involving Surgical Resection with/without Lymph Nodes or Adjuvant Chemotherapy depending on the Staging of the Disease
- Regions of the Primary Tumour are then obtained for Analysis (Whole Exome Sequencing, RNA Sequencing and Tissue Microarray), where the assessment of Multiregion and Copy Number Variations can be used to determine Nucleotide and Chromosomal Mutations
- This is used to form a Phylogenetic Tree for the Px to determine the Mutational Profile and Genetic Hetergeneity seen within the Tumour to identify Clonal and Subclonal Mutations
- Px are then followed up and if they Relapse and Develop Metastatic Disease, they are recruited to the PEACE Autopsy study where Metastatic Lesions are sampled after death
- The Sampling of Tumours at the point of Diagnosis, during Follow-up and After Death provides a Longitudinal Assessment of how the Mutational and Genetic Profile of the Tumour changed over time

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 12.27.44.png](%5B045%5D%20Tumour%20Drug%20Resistance%20b054e81628ef4cc485195a7c63e31825/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_12.27.44.png)

- Study showed that as the Number/Proportion of Subclonal Mutation Copy Number Alterations (Chromosomal/Large Scale Mutations) increases, the duration of Disease-Free Survival decreases
- However, the proportion/number of Subclonal Mutations (Nucleotide/Small Scale Mutations) in a Tumour did not impact Disease Free Survival
- Therefore, the Number/proportion of Subclonal Copy Number Alterations (Chromosomal/Large Scale Mutations) is a Prognostic Marker but the proportion/number of Subclonal Mutations (Nucleotide/Small Scale Mutations) within a Tumour that are Subclonal is not a prognostic Marker
- 45% of Tumours had Subclonal Copy Number Alterations in >20% of the Genome
- Subclonal Copy Number Alteration were found widely across different tumour types, which may reflect that cells of different tumour types undergo Chromosomal Alterations over time
- Within Chromosome 8 in Long Squamous Cell Carcinoma, there were frequent gene amplifications on Chromosomes (E.g of C-Myc) and if these same Amplifications are found in a large number of Tumours, it can be deduced that these mutations are not just random but is directly involved in Carcinogenesis as it provides the Cell with a Selective Advantage

# Towards Precision Medicine

- Need to address two principles of Darwinian evolution contributing to therapy failure
- Macroevolution largely ignored in drug development strategies
- Decipher mechanisms of cancer diversity and Genome Instability
- Genome instability processes are dynamic over time and space and therefore, these changes need to be mapped so that effective Rx strategies can be identified
- Constantly remodeling cancer genome both spatially and temporally
- Provides substrate for selection of new driver events
- Improve cancer selection pressures:
1. Target Clonal Vs Subclonal Drivers: not always stable throughout tumour life history
2. Resolve subclonal dynamics
- Understand evolutionary rule books : Epistasis and parallel evolution of subclones
- Tumour heterogeneity may be an achilles heel : tumour immunotherapy
- Early detection and screening before heterogeneity has taken place
