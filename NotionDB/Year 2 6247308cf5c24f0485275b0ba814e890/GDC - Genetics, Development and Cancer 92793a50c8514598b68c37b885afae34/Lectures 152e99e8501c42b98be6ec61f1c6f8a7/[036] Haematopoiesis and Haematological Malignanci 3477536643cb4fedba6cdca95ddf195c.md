# [036] Haematopoiesis and Haematological Malignancies

# Importance of Haematological Malignancies

### Clinical

- Most common malignancies of younger individuals
- Treatment frequently successful and has been used as the foundation of Rx for other types of malignancies

### Curability of Haematological Malignancies

- Chances of long-term disease-free survival in a 5-year old and 30- year old.
- As an individual ages, the Prognosis/Survival Rate of Haematological Cancers decreases, initially being very high in Childhood

|  | 5 Year Old | 30 Year Old | 70 Year Old |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia | 90% | 45% | 20% |
| Acute Myeloid Leukaemia | 65% | 55% | 15% |
| Hodgkin Lymphoma | 90% | 85% | 55% |
| Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (High Grade) | 85% | 60% | 50% |
- Lymphomas involve Tumours of Lymphoid Tissue (E.g Lymph Nodes, Spleen and Liver) where mature Lymphoid Cells have undergone Malignant Transformation to form cancer

### Scientific

- They have been studied intensely as it is easy to access haematological tissue (Blood, Lymph Nodes and Bone Marrow).
- They have been regularly used to Illustration important concepts in tumour pathogenesis.
1. Single cell origin of malignancy.
2. Stem cell origin of leukaemia.
3. Variable differentiation block and relationship to phenotype
- Studies of Recurrent Genetic Mutations and Chromosomal Translocations (Notably Carriers of Balanced Chromosomal Translocations) in Haematological Cancers help identify proto-oncogenes.

### Haematopoesis

- All Blood Cells originate from Multipotent HSCs in the Bone Marrow, which can proliferate to maintain their population whilst also differentiating and dividing to form all the blood cells in the Haematopoetic System
- Due to a high level of turnover for Haematopoetic Cells due to their shoft life span, there is a high rate of Haematopoesis to maintain the size of the Haematopoetic System
- Stem → Commited Progenitors (Lymphoid or Myeloid) → Mature Cells as cells differentiate and restrict their potencies as they differentiate down Lymphoid or Myeloid Pathways
- Lymphoid Cells = T and B Cells and rest of the Haematopoetic Cells are Myeloid Cells

### Hierarchy of Haematopoetic Cells

- Each step in the Differentiation events from Stem to Mature Cells is unidirectional and non-reversable so that cells cannot undifferentiate normally to produce cells with more potency
- Stem cells: detectable by in vivo assays in animals as their proliferative activity to produce more stem cells cannot be effectively demonstrated in vitro.
- Progenitor cells: detectable by in vitro assays (e.g. colony forming assays where single progenitor cells proliferate in vitro to form colonies).
- Precursor cells: morphologically recognisable under microscopes as they have some characteristics of fully differentiated cells but not all of these features.
- End cells: fully differentiated and have a short life span.
- Due to the Proliferative Nature of Tumour Cells, they must arise from Stem Cells or acquire mutations that allow them to proliferate/self-renewal

# 2. Clonal Origins of Malignancies

- The Monocloncal Origin of Malignancies was identified as Tumour Cells consisted of a Group of Cells that all contained Disease and Individual Specific Cytogenetic/Chromosomal Abnormalities, indicating that the population of identical cells was produced by the proliferation of a Single Malignantly Transformed Cell
- In Normal B Cell Developments, B Cells express a BCR that either contains a κ or λ Ig Light Chain at random, which is retained by the B Cell as it matures and differentiates into Plasma Cells, producing Polyclonal B Cell Populations comprised of cells expressing either κ or λ Ig Light Chain on their BCR
- However, in B Cell Malignancies, all cells either express κ or λ Ig Light Chain but this is a Monoclonal Population so therefore, all the cells in that population were derived from a Single Malignant B Cell and retained its Light Chain Isoform
- Immunoglobulin light chain restriction in B cell malignancies:
1. Useful in differential diagnosis of a marginal lymphocytosis/lymphadenopathy due to an infection (Polyclonal B Cells) or a Lymphoma (Monoclonal B Cells)

# 3 & 4. Stem Cell Origin of Leukaemia and Variable Differentiation Block and Relationship To Phenotype

### Haematopoetic Progenitors Depend on External Cues For Growth and Survival

- Haematopoetic Progenitors and HSCs are found within the Bone Marrow where External Signals found within their environment stimulate cell growth and survival via direct contact with ECM and Stromal Cells and diffusable Growth Factors and other growth regulators
- Stimulate cell growth: growth factors (SCF, Tpo, EPO), ECM
components (fibronectin, GAGs), other regulators (Jagged, Wnt).
- In the steady state, with normal EPO levels, Many Erythrocyte Precursors of the various differentiation stages undergo apoptosis but when the Haematopoetic System is stress (E.g Low RBC Count, The Kidney increases more EPO, increasing EPO which inhibits RBC progenitor apoptosis, allowing for these cells to differentiate and proliferation to increase RBC Production

### Classification of Leukaemia

- Leukaemia may present as Leukocytosis but this isn’t always the case - However, there will always be an excess of Abnormal WBCs in the Bone Marrow that may be released into the Blood

**Acute - NEW**

- Malignant cells have a primitive/undifferentiated phenotype and appear to be arrested at a precursor stage of differentiation
- Disease generally progresses quickly and so without rapid Rx, Px die very rapidly.
- Often bone marrow failure at presentation - Clinical features of Leukaemia (Pancytopaenia → Causes Immunosuppression, Hypocoagulability and Anaemia/Hypoxia due to Leukocytopaenia, Thrombocytopaenia and Erythropaenia respectively) mainly due to this and is the main cause of Death from Acute Leukaemia.

**Chronic**

- Excess proliferation of more mature cells vs undifferentiated cells.
- Clinical features due to cellular burden (e.g. gout, organomegaly, sweats, low grade fever, weight loss) and may be diagnosed due to these Sx or incidentally via Blood Tests for alternative reasons
- Bone marrow failure is a late feature of this disease so Px do not typically present with Sx of Bone Marrow Failure

|  | Acute | Chronic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Myeloid | Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) | Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) |
| Lymphoid | Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) | Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (CLL) |
- Haematological Malignancies tend to be less genetically complex (caused by fewer mutations) than Epithelial Mutations
- E.g CML → Px present with Leukocytosis (Notably Neutrophils) and Significant Splenomegaly.
- This was the first Malignancy where a common genetic Mutation was identified as the cause of the Malignancy due to its presence in all cases of the Tumour
- This Mutation is where a Px has a Shortened Chromosome 22 and a Longer Chromosome 9 due to a Translocation between Chromosome 22 (Containing the BCR Gene) and Chromosome 9 (Containing the Abl Gene)
- This forms a shortened Chromosome 22 (Philadephia Chromosome) that contains the BCR-ABL Fusion gene responsible for CML

# Leukaemia

### Acute Leukaemia

**Pathogenesis**

- Differentiation Block occurs at an early stage of differentiation, causing an Accumulation of immature cells and a lack of mature cells.
- Generally, Acute Leukaemias follow a pattern of Initiating Genetic Events that result in the sequential accumulation of mutations that lead to Cellular Immortalisation (Ability of Self-Renewal/Endless Proliferation), Differentiation Block Early in Development and a Growth and Survival Advantage

**Clinical Presentation:**

- Sx of Bone Marrow Failure:
1. Anaemia
2. Thrombocytopaenia → Can lead to easy and widespread Bruising and Retinal Haemorrhages
3. Neutropenia (WBC Can be High, Normal or Low) → Can cause Bacterial and Fungal Infections
- There may be Sx related to tissue infiltration by Leukaemic Blast Cells (Undifferentiated Leukaemia Cells):
1. Lymphadenopathy and Hepato-Splenomegaly
2. Gum Hypertrophy
3. Rash, Subcutaneous Chloromas (Purple Masses on the Skin)
4. CNS Involvement

### Biopsy

**Bone Marrow Aspirate:**

- Lack of Normal/Mature Blood Cells
- Many Undifferentiated, Monomorphic (Same Morphology) Cells instead of Multiple Different Cell Types due to many different Mature blood cells being present within the Bone Marrow

**Trephine Biopsy**

- Normally, Bone Trabeculae can be seen dividing the marrow into discrete segments which are populated by Developing Blood Cells interspersed by large numbers of Adipocytes (Appear as Circular Artefacts as they do not stain well)
- In Acute Leukaemia, Trabeculae can be seen but they do not divide the marrow cavity into segments where Developing Blood Cells are undergoing Haematopoesis
- This is because Proliferation of Malignant Cells crosses between these segments, causing marrow cavities to stain more intensely, containing very few Adipocytes
- For T Cell Leukaemias, some of these Abnormal T Cells developing in the Bone Marrow can be seen migrating to the Thymus to complete their development, causing the formation of a Large Mediastinal Mass due to Thymic Involvement and Infiltration

![Screenshot 2022-03-12 at 18.05.16.png](%5B036%5D%20Haematopoiesis%20and%20Haematological%20Malignanci%203477536643cb4fedba6cdca95ddf195c/Screenshot_2022-03-12_at_18.05.16.png)

### Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia

**Pathogenesis:**

- Excessive proliferation leads to accumulation of functional mature cells.
- No effect on differentiation.
- Lots of differentiated neutrophils and other blood cells.

# Frequency of Balanced Translocations Which Help Identify Proto-Oncogenes

### Mechanisms of Reciprocal Translocation

- Double stranded breaks (DSBs) are usually repaired rapidly to prevent Chromosomal Translocations from occurring but when this is the case, DSBs on 2 Chromosomes cause the 2 sections of the chromosome either side of the break to separate from one another, allowing one of these Chromosomal Fragments to become attached to another Chromosomes where DSBs have also occurred, causing Reciprocal Chromosomal Translocation (Exchange of Chromosomal Fragments between different Chromosomes).

![Screenshot 2022-03-12 at 18.13.52.png](%5B036%5D%20Haematopoiesis%20and%20Haematological%20Malignanci%203477536643cb4fedba6cdca95ddf195c/Screenshot_2022-03-12_at_18.13.52.png)

- In Haematological Malignancies (Mainly Leukaemias), Common Abnormalities can be seen where DSBs occur part way along the coding sequence of a gene, causing a Chromosomal Translocation that produces a gene at the Break Site comprised of different gene segments from 2 different Chromosomes (Fusion Genes)
- This Fusion Gene will be expressed to produced a new fusion protein with an abnormal function that will dysregulate the expression of the fusion gene to potentially drive malignant Transformation
- E.g In Acute Lukaemias, Recurrent Chromosomal Translocations are commonly seen involving DSBs within the coding sequence of genes involved in Transcriptional Regulation (E.g Encode Transcription Factors), causing Transcriptional Deregulation (E.g  RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and PML-RARA Translocations)
- RUNX1 is important in normal Haematopoesis and is commonly involved in Translocations to form Fusion Genes which are deregulated, causing the RUNX1 Gene Segment of the Fusion Gene to become upregulated, causing excessive Haematopoesis that contributes to the development of Leukaemia
- In Chronic Leukaemia, Genes involved in Chromosomal Translocations are usually not involved in the production of TFs to regulate Transcription but are usually involved in Intracellular Signalling, causing Abnormal Cellular Signalling due to the production of the Fusion Gene whose expression is deregulated
- E.g Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia contains the BCR-ABL Translocation in the Philadelphia Chromosome, causing Abnormal Expression of ABL which encodes a Tyrosine Kinase
- These Translocations are typically present very early on in the Development of Leukaemia (Usually the First Abnormality that drives Carcinogenesis) and hence, they tend to be present in all tumour cells and persist in tumour cells present following Relapse after Rx due to their role in Tumour Survival
- This means that they can be very useful in Dx as these Fusion Genes are not present in Non-Malignant Cells and Monitoring of Cancer Progression/Rx Efficacy via analysis of Fusion Genes using PCR
- Due to their role in Driving Carcinogenesis and maintaining the survival and proliferation of Malignant Cells, they are potentially useful as Therapeutic Targets to Rx Cancers

![Screenshot 2022-03-12 at 18.17.42.png](%5B036%5D%20Haematopoiesis%20and%20Haematological%20Malignanci%203477536643cb4fedba6cdca95ddf195c/Screenshot_2022-03-12_at_18.17.42.png)

- In B cell tumours, DSBs usually do not occur within a Gene Sequence to produce Fusion Genes but rather, in Non-Coding DNA Regions so that a whole gene may translocate to another chromosome so that its expression is now regulated by a different promotor
- In B Cells, Chromosomal Translocations can cause Proto-Oncogenes driving Cell Proliferation or Survival to be translocated so that their expression is now regulated by Immunoglobin Promotors
- As Immunoglobulin Promotors are highly active in B Cells to maintain High Levels of Ig Production, the Proto-Oncogene becomes Overexpressed, causing it to become an Oncogene which leads to excessive Cellular Proliferation and Mutated Cell Survival which can then lead to Cancer development
- Example: Burkitt lymphoma between IgH-Myc.
- Example: follicular lymphoma between IgH-Bcl2.

# What Can We Learn From The Identification of Specific Molecular Abnormalities In Malignant Disease?

- Insights into normal cell biology.
- Targets for diagnosis and assessing effectiveness of Rx.
- Targets for rational drug design to allow for specific Rx of the Cancer.
- Conventional cytotoxic drugs mainly act by causing DNA damage within tumour cells preferentially to trigger apotosis in these tumours.

# Signalling Pathways Can Control Various Cell Functions via Alterations In Gene Expression

- Replication
- Differentiation
- Survival/death
- Movement

---

# Signal Transduction Modules

- Signal Tranduction Pathways provide Molecular links between changes in cell environment and cellular responses.
- Example: erythropoietin and prevention of apoptosis in erythroid
progenitors to allow for Proliferation of RBCs.
- Example: G-CSF causes the release of bone marrow neutrophil stores into the blood to produce a rapid, short duration increase in Circulating Neutrophil Levels and increased proliferation of myeloid progenitors that are destined to become Neutrophils to produce a more sustained increase in Circulating Neutrophil Levels.

### Hallmarks of Cancer

1. Evading Apoptosis
2. Self-Sufficiency in Growth Signals (Automaticity)
3. Insensitivity to Anti-Growth Signals
4. Tissue Invasion and Metastasis
5. Limitless Replicative Potential (Immortality)
6. Sustained Angiogenesis
- Many of these arise due to mutations in Cellular Signalling Components within Malignant Cells

# Tyrosine Kinase (TK)

- The Intracellular/Cytoplasmic Domain of Growth Factor Receptors have Tyrosine Kinase Activity
- TK phosphorylates substrates on Tyrosine Residues, causing a Conformational Change in the Intracellular Portion of the Receptor to allow it to bind additional cytoplasmic components and activate downstream signalling mechanisms.
- In absence of growth factor, Growth Factor Receptors are present as monomers so TK is inactivated to prevent cellular signalling.
- When GF binds, it binds to the extracellular domain of Multiple Growht Factor Receptors, allowing Growth Factor Receptors to dimerise or oligomerise, triggers activation of the Tyrosine Kinase Domains of the Intracellular Portion of the Receptor.
- Binding of the GF to the extracellular domain brings the TK domains of bound receptor together, leading to a conformational change, cross-phosphorylation of Tyrosine Residues.
- Phosphorylated tyrosine is a docking station to other substrates, and can activate Ras, PI3K, STAT, which activate other downstream signalling pathways.

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 16.33.26.png](%5B036%5D%20Haematopoiesis%20and%20Haematological%20Malignanci%203477536643cb4fedba6cdca95ddf195c/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_16.33.26.png)

### Ras Protein

- Ras protein acts as a molecular switch in response to changes in
external environment of cell.
- Ras can bind to GTP or GDP.
- In inactivated cell, Ras is bound to GDP in an inactive confirmation.
- Once GF binds to its receptor, Tyrosine Crossphosphorylation of Intracellular Receptor Domain activates exchange factors such as SOS, allowing Ras to exchange GDP for GTP, leading to Ras activation.
- This allows Ras to bind to and activate downstream signalling components to activate intracellular signalling transduction pathways to alter cell behaviour (Survival, Proliferation or Migration)
- To regulate this signalling pathway, GTPase Activating Proteins like NF-1 activate the GTPase activity of Ras-GTP, reverting it back to Ras-GDP so it can assume its inactive conformation to terminate the signalling pathway

# Examples of Signalling Pathway Abnormalities In Haematological Malignancy

- Abnormal tyrosine kinase activity: Bcr-Abl in CML and some cases of ALL.
- ↑ Ras activity (Prolonged Intracellular Signalling): point mutation or loss of NF1 in AML, ALL and Myeloma (Plasma Cell Malignancies) but are found widespread in many cancers.

### Constitutive Activity of Bcr-Abl Tyrosine Kinase

- BCr-Abl Fusion Gene originates within Stem Cells and results in increased production of Mature Blood Cells, notably Neutrophils
- As this increases the rate of Neutrophil Production, this causes Blood Smears of Px with CML to contain Neutrophils at varying stages of development (E.g Metamyelocytes with a bean shaped nucleus, Band Myelocytes with a C Shaped nucleus)

![Screenshot 2022-03-12 at 19.14.58.png](%5B036%5D%20Haematopoiesis%20and%20Haematological%20Malignanci%203477536643cb4fedba6cdca95ddf195c/Screenshot_2022-03-12_at_19.14.58.png)

- The Abl-Bcr Fusion Gene contains N-Terminal Regions of the Bcr gene and the majority of the Abl gene except its regulatory regions (Exon 1)
- All Kinase have an ATP Binding Pocket where ATP is docked so that ATP can be used directly by the Kinase to phosphorylate Tyrosine Residues, producing ADP with a low affinity for the binding pocket which causes ADP to dissociate from and leave the binding pocket
- In the Abl-Bcr Fusion Gene, the Tyrosine Kinase portion of the Gene is translocated but regulatory regions of the gene are not, causing Overactivation of the Bcr-Abl Tyrosine Kinase
- This causes Intracellular Signalling Pathways that are activated by Tyrosine Kinase (Ras-MAPK, STAT and PI3K-PKB) to become overactive in the absence of Growth Factors, leading to excessive cell proliferation

![Screenshot 2022-03-09 at 16.36.44.png](%5B036%5D%20Haematopoiesis%20and%20Haematological%20Malignanci%203477536643cb4fedba6cdca95ddf195c/Screenshot_2022-03-09_at_16.36.44.png)

### Imatinib Mesylate

- Inhibits activity of Bcr-Abl by competing with ATP at the Tyrosine Kinase ATP Binding Pocket, preventing ATP from binding to the Kinase which prevents Tyrosine Phosphorylation.
- This prevents the overactivation of downstream Signalling Pathways activated by Tyrosine Kinase, inhibiting excessive cellular proliferation so it is effective in the treatment of CML.

### Ras Proteins

- Frequently activated by mutation in human cancers, notably carcinomas
- Carcinoma: pancreas (95%), colon (50%), thyroid.
- In Carcinomas, point mutations in Ras increase the affinity of Ras for GTP and cause Ras.GTP to be insensitive to GAPs and hence, inactivation. This prevents the activation of the GTPase activity of Ras, causing Ras to remain activate for longer and hence, increasing MAPK Signalling and Cell Proliferation and Survival
- In Haematological and some other tumour types, Ras inactivation is inhibited by a loss of NF-1 or LoF Mutation to NF-1. This prevents activation of the GTPase activity of Ras, causing Ras to be active for a longer duration, increasing MAPK Signalling and hence, Cell Proliferation and Survival
- Loss of NF-1 protein also results in excess Ras activation:
- This is congenital/inherited in neurofibromatosis due to an inheritable LoF Mutation in NF-1.
- This Loss of/LoF Mutation to NF-1 is acquired in myeloid leukaemia.
