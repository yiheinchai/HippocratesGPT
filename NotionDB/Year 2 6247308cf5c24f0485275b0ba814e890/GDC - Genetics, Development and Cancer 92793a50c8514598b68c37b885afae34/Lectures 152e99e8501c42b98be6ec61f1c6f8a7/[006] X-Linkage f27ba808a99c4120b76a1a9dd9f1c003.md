# [006] X-Linkage

# X Chromosome

- 1 copy in most males (plus 1 Y chromosome) and hence, males are hemizygous
- 2 copies in most females.
- About 156 million base pairs
- Around 800 protein coding genes on X chromosome (whilst there are ~70 on Y chromosome)
- Most X chromosome genes are inactivated in one of the 2 X
chromosomes present in females (X inactivation) to establish normal gene dosage

---

# X Inactivation (Lyonization)

- All autosomal monosomies (one copy of an autosome) are lethal due to a massive reduction in gene dosage (proteins produced by genes on the chromosome) 1 vs 2 chromosomes are present, but males with only 1 X chromosome are normal.
- Equalisation of X Chromosome gene dosage across both sexes is accomplished by inactivation of 1 of 2 X chromosomes in females so that both sexes express the gene dosage of a single X chromosome.
- This means that although females have 2 copies of each X gene, only 1 is usually functional in each cell (like males).
- Inactive X chromosome visible as a dark staining, highly condensed Barr Body within the Nucleus to prevent transcription of the inactivated X chromosome.

### Methods of Inactivation

- Most genes are silenced on an X chromosome but a very small number of genes are not inactivated and still expressed.
- This is due to facultative repressive heterochromatin.
- DNA is very tightly packed and inactivated into facultative heterochromatin by:
1. DNA methylation
2. Low levels of histone acetylation.
3. Presence of histone macroH2A: helps to compress DNA even more.
- X Inactivated Heterochromatin is known as Facultative Heterochromatin (Facultative as it is not always in this state, only when it is inactivated)

# X Inactivation - When and Where?

- Irreversible X inactivation occurs in blastocyst stage of development.
- Each cell within the Blastocyst independently and randomly inactivates 1 X Chromosome.
- All daughter cells from the cell where the X chromosome is inactivated will have same X chromosome (maternal or paternal) inactivated.
- This produces a mosaic phenotype where some tissues express the inactivated X Chromosome and have one phenotype whereas others express the non-inactivated X Chromosome and have a different phenotype
- Example: tortoiseshell cat - Inactivated and Active X Chromosomes carry different fur pigmentation alleles so that it produces fur with some patches being blonde and others being black, depending on whether the tissue from which the hair contains the inactive or activated X Chromosome.

# Sex Determination

- Critical gene in sex determination is SRY (also known as TDF - Testis Determining Factor), which is usually found on Y chromosome.
- SRY gene product, together with SF1 protein, is a transcription factor that activate other genes that encode other transcription factors, allowing SRY to upregulate other transcription factors (most importantly SOX-9).
- XX men: typically have 1 copy of SRY gene translocated on their X chromosome so that the SRY gene product is still encoded and hence, male sex determination still occurs.
- XY women: often lack a functional SRY gene so that male determination does not occur, allowing them to develop into females.
- The Y Chromosome is not significant in disease as it is very small and therefore, expresses very few (if any useful) genes whereas the X Chromosome is large and expresses many important genes
- Many of the other genes on the Y Chromosome are associated with male fertility, so Y Chromosome mutations can impact male fertility

# X Linked Inheritance

### Dominant X Linked Inheritance

- Sex linked dominant conditions are extremely rare.
- Pattern of inheritance will be similar to autosomal dominant.
- However, all daughters, but none of sons of affected males will be affected (as males do not pass their X chromosome onto their sons but they do pass them to their daughters).
- 50% of the daughters and sons of a Heterozygous affected mother will be affected (as the mother passes X Chromosomes to both sons and daughters)
- Example: incontinentia pigmenti involving the IP2 gene, which is usually lethal in males.
- Example: congenital generalised hypertrichosis (wolf man syndrome)
- The pattern of inheritance will be similar to autosomal dominant (Affected individual will usually have affected parent) but **all** of the daughters, but **none** of the sons of affected males will be affected as males pass their X chromosome onto their daughters but not onto their sons (they pass their Y Chromosome to their son whilst the mother passes their X chromosome to their son)

### Recessive X Linked Inheritance

- Usually only males affected as males are hemizygous so the trait is expressed with only one allele present (unlike women who are homozygous and hence, need 2 copies of the allele to express the trait, which is extremely rare).
- No cases of male to male transmission as males pass their Y chromosome onto their sons, not X chromosome.
- All affected males can be linked through unaffected carrier females as the carriers pass on their X chromosome with the disease allele onto their sons.
- If mutant gene is lethal (such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) then it takes a very unusual event to produce an affected female as the female must be homozygous to express the trait and therefore, must inherit the alleles from a carrier mother and a father (most commonly due to germline mutation as if the father had the disease, he would be dead and unable to pass on his X chromosome).
- Example: there are about 290 X linked recessive conditions.
1. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
2. Haemophilia A: factor VIII deficiency.
3. Haemophilia B: factor IX deficiency.
4. Colour blindness: red/green.
5. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome: HGPRT deficiency.
6. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency - Heterozygosity of G6PD Deficiency provides some protective immunity against malaria

### Sex-Linked Recessive

- For a given birth, if mother is a carrier (only 1 abnormal X chromosome) and father is normal:
1. 25% chance of a normal boy.
2. 25% chance of a boy with disease.
3. 25% chance of a normal girl.
4. 25% chance of a carrier girl without disease.
- If father has disease and mother is normal:
1. 50% chance of a normal boy.
2. Near 50% of a carrier girl without disease.
- While sex-linked traits are generally expressed more often in males, some traits may be sex-limited but not sex-linked due to the presence of sex-specific tissues.
- Examples:
1. Breast cancer
2. Endometriosis

# If Females Inactivate One of Their X Chromosomes Which Contains the Healthy Allele, Why Don’t Female Carriers of Sex Linked Recessive Diseases Also Suffer From the Disease

- Sometimes they do (e.g. In Fabry disease, most of female carriers show some disease manifestation, sometimes severe due to inactivation of the healthy X Chromosome and hence, expression of the X Chromosome with the disease allele)
- Sometimes they show milder but related symptoms (to those observed in males)
- In Some cases, the Gene which is mutated to produce the disease produces a Diffusible gene product (e.g. Haemophilia A / factor VIII
deficiency). This means in some tissues where the normal gene is expressed, they can still synthesise the normal product which can be distributed around the entire body to prevent disease from occurring/maintain normal activity
- Some genes escape X-inactivation (up to 25% in humans, 3 – 15% in mice) and hence, are still expressed in the Inactivated Chromosome, preventing the disease allele on the Expressed X Chromosome from producing the disease
- Potentially, there is Preferential inactivation of one X chromosome  in individuals where there is a diseased allele on the X Chromosome, notably if the allele affects cellular functionality (e.g. the paternal X chromosome) so that the Inactivated X Chromosome that expresses the disease allele is inactivated/silenced, to prevent it from being expressed and causing disease

# Imprinting

- Imprinting can give a false impression of sex linkage.
- Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are 2 different conditions, both of which seem to be caused by very similar deletions of a small part of chromosome 15.
- So different diseases can be caused by same deletion.
- Angelman gene (UBE3A): Usually inactivated (chemically modified) on paternal chromosome, so deletion mutation in the allele on the maternal chromosome means that there is a loss of maternal contribution to Angelman gene expression (no gene expression), causing Angelman syndrome.
- Prader-Willi gene: usually inactivated on maternal chromosome, so deletion mutation in the allele on the paternal chromosome means that there is a loss of paternal contribution to Prader-Willi Gene expression (no gene expression), causing Prader-Willis syndrome.
- Differential paternal or maternal Chromosome 15 Inactivation produces 2 different syndromes as on an evolutionary level, male inheritance is concerned with passing on genes and hence, promotes fetal growth whereas female inheritance is concerned with limiting fetal growth to that which is necessary for survival but not detrimental to the health of the mother. Therefore, differential inactivation alters the balance of foetal growth in utero to produce 2 different syndromes depending on whether the growth promoting paternal or growth regulatory maternal chromosomes are mutated

# X Chromosome and Brain

- Around 3.75% of all genes are on the X chromosome
- Around 27% of brain disabilities with known genetic causes map to the X-chromosome and hence, the X Chromosome seems to be significant in the development of the brain.
- More than 333 brain disorders are associated with X-chromosome mutations, notably LoF X-Linked Recessive Mutations.
- Women are more protected than men from non/↓ function alleles as women being XX means that inheriting one mutated allele on the X Chromosome will not produce the disease whereas inheritance of a single mutated allele on the X Chromosome for men (who are hemizygous) will produce the trait.
- Therefore, Brain-Associated Disorders are more common in males than females - This could be due to a genetic risk due to Male Hemizygosity or due to the fact that as Males are Hemizygous, X-Linked Recessive Disorders affecting the Brain are more easily detected/more frequently expressed and identified as X-Linked than Autosomal Brain Disorders that equally affect both sexes (Ascertainment Bias)

# Social Intelligence

- Turner’s syndrome: some women have only 1 X chromosome vs 2
- Turner’s syndrome women who inherited their X chromosome from their fathers have more social skills/fewer social defects than those who inherited it from their mothers.
- Men inherit theirs from their mothers and also men suffer from conditions associated with ↓ social skills therefore, this difference in social skills dependent on which X Chromosome contains the Disease Allele and is inherited by the daughter, genetic imprinting may be involved in these phenotypic differences.

---

# Mutation Rate of X-Linked Genes

- 1/3 of all X chromosomes are present in males and hence 1/3 of mutant X chromosomes are present in males.
- Consequently, if condition is lethal, then 1/3 of mutant X chromosomes will be lost from population each generation due to the death of affected males.
- If frequency of disease is constant (as is the case with X-Linked Disorders), then lost mutant chromosomes via death of affected males will have to be replaced by new mutation in order to maintain constant disease rates.
- Consequently, mutation rate that produces a lethal X linked recessive disease from a healthy allele on the X Chromosome is 1/3 of frequency of allele to replace the 1/3rd of Mutated X Chromosomes lost from deceased males.
- Therefore, 1/3 of cases of Lethal X-Linked Recessive Disease will be caused by newly mutated X chromosomes.

---

# Risk Estimation

- Consider pedigree below in which there is no previous history of DMD, but not many generations are known.
- What is the chance that the sister of affected boy is a carrier?
- Obvious (wrong) answer is 1/2 as this assumes that mother must be a carrier and hence, passes the disease allele onto her son, which can be expressed to produce DMD as the boy is hemizygous.
- However, because affected boy may be result of a new mutation in the Maternal X Chromosome (with a 1/3 chance), there is only a 2/3 chance that his mother is a carrier and therefore only a 1/3 (2/3 x 1/2) chance that his sister is a carrier.
- If however, there had been 2 affected brothers or an affected maternal uncle as well as affected brother, this history indicates that there is consistent disease inheritance down the maternal line and therefore, we could have been can that mother was a carrier (acquired X Chromosome with Mutation from her mother) and first answer of 1/2 would have been correct.

# Problem of Phase

- Haplotipic/Gametic Phase is the arrangement/positioning of specific alleles along individual sex chromosomes within a diploid genome (identification of specific alleles to specific maternal/paternal chromosomes)
- This is useful for mapping genes associated with various disease onto specific loci of a Chromosome
- Imagine you have 2 sites on a chromosome that are variable, site 1 can have a C or T allele, and site 2 can have an A or G allele.
- If you genotype an individual, they will be heterozygous at both sites.
- However, you don’t have the complete information about which allele belongs to which copy of chromosome, only that the genotype/allele pairings exist.
- C at site 1 could be on same chromosome as A on site 2 or on the same chromosome as G on site 2 - Gametic/Haplotipic Phase.
- There are ways to find this out:
1. For Autosomes, Complex Statistical Procedures are required but these are not 100% accurate
- This is not a problem for sex chromosomes in men, as there is only 1 X chromosome so they are hemizygous (cannot be heterozygous), so the affected allele can only be found on the Maternal X Chromosome (only 1 possible Phase), allowing Gametic Phase to be determined easily.
