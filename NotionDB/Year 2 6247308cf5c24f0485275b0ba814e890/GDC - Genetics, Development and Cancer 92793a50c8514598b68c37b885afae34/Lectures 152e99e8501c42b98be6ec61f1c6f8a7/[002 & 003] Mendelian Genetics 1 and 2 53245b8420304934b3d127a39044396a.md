# [002 & 003] Mendelian Genetics 1 and 2

# Mendel’s Laws

- 0th law: genes are particulate vs fluid and come in different discrete forms known as alleles. This shows that offspring inherit discrete traits rather than a blend of parental traits
- 1st law (segregation): organisms have 2 copies of each gene but transmit only 1 to each offspring.
- Which one is transmitted is chosen at random. I.e. if you are heterozygous for 2 different alleles, these alleles will segregate/separate from each other in your offspring so that only one is inherited.
- Example: passing on blue hair gene to 1 offspring has no effect of passing green or blue hair gene to other offspring.

- 2nd law (independence of assortment): where alleles for > 1 gene are segregating/separating, segregation/separation at each gene (allele pair) occurs independently of others so that the inheritance of one gene does not affect that of another (exception is during linkage)
- Example: whether you pass blue or green hair gene has no effect on passing big or small feet gene.

- Mendel also introduced the concept of dominance where if an individual has two different alleles of the same gene (is heterozygous) encoding different traits, one allele will be dominant over the other and hence, the dominant allele will express its trait and mask the other

- Mendelian Diseases are monogenic in cause and show classical Mendelian Inheritance Patterns

---

# Autosomal Dominant Inheritance

- All affected individuals should have an affected parent, unless dominant disease allele is product of a new mutation in a previous generation (typically, affected individuals are found in each generation).
- Most mating will be of form M/m × m/m.
- Both sexes should be equally affected.
- Roughly 50% of offspring of an affected individual should be affected (assuming parent is heterozygous, 100% if homozygous).
- Example: Huntington’s disease, achondroplastic dysplasia, neurofibromatosis → This is a rarer form of inheritance

---

# Autosomal Recessive Inheritance

- This usually arises where a mutation causes a LoF of one copy of a gene
- Often there is no previous family history of the condition (previous generations will not be affected).
- Most likely place to find a second affected child is a sibling of first.
- If a child is affected, subsequent full siblings have a 1/4 chance of being affected (as each parent is a carrier).
- Example: cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, Tay Sachs disease → This is the most common form of inheritance
- It has been estimated that we each carry around 3 autosomal recessive lethal disease alleles but the frequencies of individual recessive mutations are low across a population so there is a very small chance that two carriers will mate to produce an affected offspring

![Screenshot 2022-02-27 at 11.12.32.png](%5B002%20&%20003%5D%20Mendelian%20Genetics%201%20and%202%2053245b8420304934b3d127a39044396a/Screenshot_2022-02-27_at_11.12.32.png)

### Autosomal Recessive in Consanguineous Families

- Inbreeding increases the chance of observing an autosomal recessive condition as it is more likely than members of the same family are carriers for the same affected recessive allele than 2 unrelated individuals.
- However, one generation of outbreeding nullify the effects of previous inbreeding within a generation on the risk of autosomal recessive conditions as the 2 non-related individuals are unlikely to be carrying the same recessive disease allele due to the low frequency of recessive diseases alleles in the population
- E.g. Cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, Tay Sachs disease.

# Exceptions To Expected Mendelian Genetics - Homozygous Lethals

### Homozygous Lethals

- Many dominant mutations are in fact semi-dominant (phenotype of homozygote is more extreme than phenotype of heterozygotes).
- Therefore, if the Homozygous genotype is lethal whereas the Heterozygous genotype is not lethal, there would be no Homozygous individuals (parents or offspring) so instead of producing a typical 1:2:1 ratio of HH:Hh:hh when 2 Heterozygous individuals mate, there would be a 0:2:1 ratio of HH:Hh:hh of offspring
- Example: Danforth’s short tail in mice. T/+ mice develop a short tail, but T/T homozygotes die as early embryos.
- Example: Achondroplasia dwarfism in humans.
- Usually caused by a new, dominant mutation in FGFR3 gene, which causes abnormal cartilage formation.
- It is usually inherited from father and the mutation arises during spermatogenesis.
- In the Heterozygous form, produces the typical features of Achondroplastic Dwarfism but it is lethal in its Homozygous form

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Incomplete/Partial/Semi-Dominance

- This is where the phenotype of the heterozygous genotype is distinct from and often intermediate between the Phenotypes of the Homozygous genotypes as the dominant allele does not completely mask the phenotype of the unaffected allele
- This may lead to the distortion of apparent ratios or to creation of unexpected classes of offspring.
- Example: familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) has 3 phenotypes:
1. +/+ = normal
2. +/- = death as young adult
3. -/- = death in childhood
- Gene responsible codes for liver receptor for cholesterol and number of receptors is proportional to the number of active genes
- If number of receptors is ↓, level of cholesterol in blood ↑ and risk of coronary artery disease ↑ and hence, earlier age of death.
- Similar to lethal alleles, but homozygous genotype is less severe.

### Sickle Cell Disease

- Example: Sickle Cell Disease and Trait
- Glutamine 6-to-Valine mutation in β-globin chain of HbA causes haemaglobin (HbS) to polymerise to form long stiff fibres that distort erythrocytes and cause cell sickling, notably in anoxic conditions (vigorous exercise)
- Sickle cells can obstruct blood flow and break down prematurely, and are associated with anaemia.
- Obstruction of small blood capillaries can cause painful vaso-occlusive crises, damage to major organs, and increased vulnerability to severe infections.
- Symptoms can be brought on by exercise and associated
hypoxia and/or acidosis.
- In Homozygous Genotypes, this gives rise to Sickle Cell Disease, characterised by Anaemia and reduced life expectancy due to vaso-occlusive crises
- In Heterozygous Genotypes, this gives rise to Sickle Cell Trait, which is often asymptomatic/very mild and provides protective immunity against Malaria

---

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Co-Dominance

- If ≥ 2 alleles can each be distinguished in phenotype in presence of other/when expressed together, they are said to be co-dominant.
- Example: ABO blood group where A and B alleles are co-dominant but O is recessive.
- ABO gene codes for glycosyl-transferase, which modifies H antigen on surface of erythrocytes.
- A form adds N-acetylgalactosamine to the H Ag to form the A Ag.
- B form adds D-galactose to the H Ag to form the B Ag.
- O form has a frameshift mutation, producing a truncated and inactive form of Glycosyl-transferase that cannot modify H antigen.
- All alleles can be understood as Co-dominant when both alleles are revealed by a direct study of an individual’s DNA as direct visualisation of DNA produces a DNA phenotype where both alleles can be seen and therefore, as the DNA phenotype is formed by the combination of both alleles, both alleles can be seen as co-dominant (both alleles are expressed individually in the DNA phenotype)

---

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Silent Alleles

- In multiple allele systems, it is sometimes not obvious/unknown that a silent allele exists which is recessive and does not encode a protein and hence, is not expressed in a phenotype.
- These silent alleles might be unknown as they are very rare so seeing homozygous individuals for the silent allele does not occur
- This can give confusing results in pedigree trees for parents with codominant alleles where the offspring with the silent allele only express the trait of non-silent allele, despite both parents having different alleles and therefore, expressing different traits.
- Example: adenosine deaminase (associated with severe-combined immunodeficiency, haemolytic anaemia and possibly autism) has 2 common alleles A and B, which code for 2 forms of enzyme that can be separated by electrophoresis.
- Also has rare O allele which codes for no protein.
- You might think that daughter (II3) must be a case of false paternity as she does not have the AB Genotype like her siblings, but in fact she has received a silent O allele from her father so only the B allele from the mother is expressed.
- His genotype is in fact AO, and mother’s is BB so the daughter is BO.
- This applies to ABO blood group system but there we are more used to idea of silent O alleles.

---

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Epistasis

- Occurs when the action/inheritance of 1 gene masks effects of another, making it impossible to identify genotype of second separate gene of which the first gene is not an allele.
- This is most clearly seen in genes encoding proteins involved in biosynthetic pathways, where the products of one gene-encoded protein are further modified by that if another gene-encoded protein
- Example: if both genes produce enzymes which act in same biochemical pathway.
- If product of gene 1 is absent, due to patient being homozygous for a mutation, then it is not possible to tell genotype of gene 2.
- Example: gene causing albinism would mask expression of genes controlling eye or hair colour.

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 20.03.51.png](%5B002%20&%20003%5D%20Mendelian%20Genetics%201%20and%202%2053245b8420304934b3d127a39044396a/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_20.03.51.png)

- Example: Bombay phenotype caused by incomplete synthesis of the H antigen (missing fucose group)
- This means the ABO phenotype will be O even if the individual carries the A or B alleles as the lack of H Antigen means that Glycosyl-Transferase cannot modify it to form the A or B Ag.
- It appears impossible for individual II3 to be daughter of I1 if the H Ag was expressed in all offspring.
- 99% of time this would be correct, but on this occasion, both parents (I1 and I2) are carriers of h/Bombay associated allele (i.e. both are H/h).
- II3 has therefore inherited h from both parents (h/h), she expresses the Bombay Phenotype and is blood group O with no H Ag, despite also carrying A or B alleles.

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Pleiotropy

- Mutations in 1 gene may have many possible effects/symptoms in different individuals.
- Therefore, problems in tracing passage of mutant allele through a pedigree can arise when different membranes of a family express a different subset of symptoms based on the effect produced by the mutated allele in the individual.
- This occurs whenever a gene product is required in more than 1 tissue or organ and has different roles in these different tissues.
- Example: Phenylketonuria, Autism and Schizophrenia (E.g CACNA1C Gene), Sickle Cell Anaemia, Albinism (Tyrosinase Gene and Tyrosine Metabolism) and Marfan’s Syndrome (Fibrillin 1 Gene)

---

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Genetic Heterogeneity

- This is where a single condition be caused by mutations in more than 1 gene.
- Example: Tuberous Sclerosis (benign tumours in various organs).
- An identical disease phenotype is produced by mutations in either of 2 unrelated genes, TSC1 on chromosome 9 (codes for hamartin) or TSC2 on chromosome 16 (codes for tuberin).
- Both genes act in same biochemical or regulatory pathway so therefore, the same condition can be caused by mutations in different genes as these individual mutations all disrupt the same pathway to produce the same clinical condition.
- This is true in this case where the protein products of 2 genes interact so therefore, mutations altering either gene can alter the interaction of their protein products to cause the disease.

---

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Variable Expressivity

- Degree to and form in which a disease may manifest itself can be very variable despite being caused by the same mutation.
- Example: polydactyly has many different forms.
1. Small extra bump on side of hand.
2. Finger which widens to end in 2 fingertips.
3. Extra finger which dangles by a thin cord from hand.
4. Hand which looks normal except that it has a thumb and 5 fingers.
5. Other variations

---

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Incomplete Penetrance

- In extreme cases of low expressivity, some individuals show no symptoms, despite carrying a disease allele, but their parents and children might as other factors beyond the specific genetic mutation alter whether the disease presents in an affected individual or not.
- This can be seen by looking directly at DNA (if disease allele is known).
- x% penetrance means that x% of people carrying disease allele will get disease.
- Example: mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 give an 80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.

---

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Germline Mosaicism

- If a new disease mutation occurs in 1 germ cell precursor out of many non-mutant precursors, mutant germ cells derived from the mutant germ cell precursor will be found (in a small proportion) alongside many non-mutant germ cells within the gonads so that the parent contains some germ cells with the mutation and some without.
- This will result in offspring carrying disease allele in non-Mendelian ratios, depending on whether the offspring are formed from the mutant or non-mutant germ cell population (i.e. will not produce mutant offspring in expected Mendelian numbers).
- Most common with autosomal dominant and X-linked disorders and usually, only a single generation is germ line mosaic so the condition will only be seen in their offspring (normal parents but affected children).
- Example: osteogenesis imperfecta; Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

---

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Phenocopies

- An environmentally caused trait may mimic a genetic trait so phenocopies can be seen when a condition has both genetic and environmental causes.
- This means that cases of a condition in offspring may appear to be genetic in origin (producing apparent non-mendelian inheritance) but are actually environmentally caused
- Example: Heat shock delivered to Drosophila pupae may cause a variety of defects that mimic those caused by mutations in genes affecting wing or leg development.
- Example: thalidomide caused phenocopies of rare genetic disease familial phocomelia.

---

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Anticipation

- Genetic disease appears with earlier onset and/or ↑ severity in succeeding generations, causing an apparent increase in frequency of the condition in subsequent generations.
- This is caused by an increased number of trinucleotide microsatellite repeats (have to be trinucleotide so that it involves the insertion of a whole codon and doesn’t induce a frameshift mutation which renders the protein non-functional) within the exon region of some genes in subsequent generations, producing a protein product with additional AAs but is still functional.
- They can sometimes be found in UTRs, Promoters and Splice Sites of Introns
- Genes can tolerate number of trinucleotide repeats up to a certain extent and still maintain normal function but beyond a certain number of repeats, the additional AAs in the protein distort its function, making it become disease associated.
- The more trinucleotide repeats you have, the more mutable the microsatellite sequence become, meaning there is increased likelihood that the subsequent generations will have more repeats and hence, have the condition
- Example: myotonic dystrophy; Huntington’s disease; fragile X syndrome, Friedrich’s Ataxia

---

# Exceptions to Mendelian Genetics - Incomplete Ascertainment/Ascertainment Bias

- Many families where both parents are carriers of an autosomal recessive mutation will not have any affected children and thus will not come to medical attention and hence, the allele is not known to be recessive.
- This biases our observations only to families with affected offspring.
- If this ascertainment bias is not taken into account, we may imagine that we are dealing with a disease which is inherited in a way other than autosomal recessive when actually it is an autosomal recessive disease that has not been identified as recessive due to its low incidence meaning it does not display typical recessive inheritance patterns.

---

# Genuine Non-Mendelian Inheritance - Mitochondrial Inheritance

- There are relatively few human genetic diseases caused by mitochondrial mutations, but because of their maternal
transmission, they have a very distinctive pattern of inheritance.
- All children are from an affected female but no children of affected male will inherit disease.
- Example:
1. MERF: myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibres.
2. MELAS: mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes.
3. LHON: Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy.
- Mitochondrial inheritance can be complicated by:
1. Heteroplasmy (when only a proportion of mitochondrial DNA molecules within a single mitochondria are defective) so an individual inherits both mitochondria with normal and mutated mtDNA from the mother (this can be transmitted across multiple generations)
2. By interaction of products of mitochondrial genes with products of nuclear coded genes (so the effects of Mitochondrial disease are influenced by mutations seen in the Nuclear Gene)
3. By somatic mtDNA changes that may occur with age.

---

# Genuine Non-Mendelian Inheritance - Uniparental Disomy

- Both copies of a single chromosome may be inherited from same parent along with no copies of corresponding chromosome from other parent where segregation fails to occur during Meiosis.
- This occurs due to a failure of segregation of Chromosomes or sister chromatids, where one gamete/offspring contains two copies of the same chromosome from one parent whilst the other gamete/offspring contains no copies
- Example: rare cases of cystic fibrosis (common autosomal recessive disease) have occurred in which 1 parent was a heterozygous carrier of disease, but 2nd parent had 2 wild type alleles (which would normally produce carrier or non-carrier offspring).
- Child had received 2 copies of mutant chromosome 7 from carrier parent and no chromosome 7 from unaffected parent, causing the child to be affected.

# Genuine Non-Mendelian Inheritance - Linkage

- When 2 genes are found close to one another on same chromosome, their alleles tend to be inherited together because of mechanisms of chromosome segregation at meiosis.
- This means that they do not obey law of independent assortment (Mendel’s 2nd law).
- The closer genes are, less independent their assortment will be.
- This forms basis for 1 of main methods for finding a link between a gene and disease

### Recombination and Linkage

- Genetic regions are said to be linked if they are on same chromosome.
- The closer they are, the more linked they are (more likely they are to be found on the same recombinant chromosome as there is a reduced chance that a recombination event/chiasmata will occur between the two loci that will separate them onto different chromosomes). This means that alleles in those regions will be co-inherited more frequently.

![Screenshot 2022-02-27 at 13.45.03.png](%5B002%20&%20003%5D%20Mendelian%20Genetics%201%20and%202%2053245b8420304934b3d127a39044396a/Screenshot_2022-02-27_at_13.45.03.png)

- In Genetic Linkage Mapping for Huntington’s Disease, a marker found at a locus close to (and hence linked to) the Mutated Huntingtin Gene was found in individuals who had Huntington’s Disease (but inheritance of the marker alone did not cause Huntington’s Disease), indicating that a gene on a nearby locus of the Chromosome was responsible for the disease (This allowed for mapping/localisation of genetic diseases to specific loci on Chromosomes)

![Screenshot 2022-02-27 at 13.51.30.png](%5B002%20&%20003%5D%20Mendelian%20Genetics%201%20and%202%2053245b8420304934b3d127a39044396a/Screenshot_2022-02-27_at_13.51.30.png)

- In the first pedigree, the disease co-segregates/is linked with with an A allele of the marker so that individuals with the disease inherit have the A Marker as well, indicating that the A loci is near to the D loci.
- In the second pedigree, the disease initially co-segregates with a B
allele until there is a recombination event between the B and Disease allele, after which it co-segregates with a C allele, which is now found near to the disease allele.

# Microsatellites and Linkage Analysis

- The identification of many genes that give rise to Mendelian Diseases were identified using Microsatellites as they are often unique in repeat number within a family and hence, can be used to localise disease genes within a Chromosome and their inheritance down a pedigree tree
