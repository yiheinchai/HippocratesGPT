# Introduction

- X shaped chromosome is actually 2 sister chromatids (each chromatid is a single chromosome in completion) are joined together following DNA Replication in preparation for Mitosis.
- At metaphase, chromosomes are at their most dense and hence, easily stained with dyes and enzymes to be visualised.
- When these enzymes are visualised, they produce banding patterns across various sections of the Chromosome, which can be used alongside the relative length/size of the Chromosome can be used to identify the individual Chromosomes
- Most of the time, Chromosomes are diffuse structures in the Nucleus that are not readily visible

- Centromere: ‘handle’ of chromosome (not always at the centre of the Chromosome), where cellular machinery (notably spindles and microtubules) grabs to in order to move chromosome during cellular division.
- Telomere: ends of chromosome with specific sequences.
- The Length of Telomeres are maintained in Germ Cells via the activity of Telomerase which is expressed in high amounts but in Somatic Cells, Telomeres shorten with age/subsequent cell divisions and can eventually become lost
- When Telomeres are lost, Chromosomes become unstable which can lead to Chromosomal Mutations
- P arm: shorter arm.
- Q arm: longer arm.
- Segments of the Chromosome are named in the format a(q/p)bc.d where a = Chromosome Number, q/p = whether locus is on p or q arm and bc.d based on classical banding pattern of Chromosome indicating the specific location of the DNA sequence on the chromosomal arm
- Banding is generated by degree to which chromosome condensed.
- Heterochromatin: indicated on Ideograms by hatched appearance, due to variable length under staining, comprised of gene-sparse regions of DNA.

# Ideogram

- Cartoon representation of idealised banding pattern of different chromosomes following standardised enzymatic and chemical dye treatments.
- Acrocentric Chromosomes have their centromere near the telomeres (end of the Chromosome) so that most of the Chromosomal Material is on one arm whilst the other arm is very short
- Useful because it allows identification of certain chromosomal abnormalities: extra chromosomes (trisomy), deletions, translocations.

- Nowadays, a human Karyogram can be obtained with each chromosome hybridised with a molecular probe that is attached to a coloured chromophore that fluoresces  (Fluorescent in Situ Hybridisation).
- These Fluorescent Labelled Probes will hybridise to complementary regions of the Chromosome and will therefore, fluorescently stain different regions of the Chromosome
- The use of Multiple Molecular Probes, each attached to a differently coloured chromophore can be used to stain all the chromosomes a different colour to produce a Karyogram, where chromosomes are visualised as matched homologous pairs (in their metaphase), each staining a different colour
- This allows Chromosomes to be more easily visualised to allow for Chromosomal Abnormalities to be more easily identified

# Numerical Abnormalities

### Full Sets

- Euploidy: category of chromosome changes which involve addition or loss of complete sets of chromosomes.
- Haploidy: only 1 set of chromosomes/sister chromatids is present due to loss of the other homologous chromosome.
- Triploidy: possession of 1 complete extra set of chromosomes/sister chromatids (Px has 3 Homologous Sister Chromatids).
- Usually caused by polyspermy.
- Such embryos will usually spontaneously abort.
- Tetraploidy: extra 2 sets of chromosomes (Px has 4 Homologous Sister Chromatids) that usually results from a failure of 1st zygotic division just after fertilisation.
- This is lethal to embryo.
- Any other cell division may also fail to complete properly and in consequence, a very small proportion of tetraploid cells are somatic can sometimes be found in normal individuals and have no adverse effect on the individual.

### Single Chromosomes

- Aneuploidy: The category of chromosome changes which do not involve whole sets.
- It is usually consequence of a failure of a single chromosome (or bivalent chromosomes/sister chromatid) to complete division.
- Monosomies: only one chromosome/chromatid is present in the Px
- all autosomal monosomies are lethal in very early embryogenesis.
- They do not even feature in table of mutation frequencies which follows because they abort too early even to be recognised
as a conception.
- Most Trisomies are also lethal and cause spontaneous abortion early in embryogenesis
- Trisomy: 3 chromosomes/chromatids are present in the Px
- Trisomy (example: trisomy 21, Down syndrome): incidence of trisomy 21 ↑ exponential with maternal age (and slightly with paternal age) but roughly 50% of offspring with Trisomy 21 will spontaneously abort.
- Reason trisomy 21 survives compared to other trisomies is because chromosome 21 contains very few genes.

# Down Syndrome Incidence Increases with Maternal Age

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 22.58.08.png](%5B012%5D%20Cytogenetics%20f16b7da7e67c43dfa103b450a4a1420b/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_22.58.08.png)

---

# Meiotic Nondisjunction

- This is not the only cause of Trisomies but is the main cause and occurs when the homologous chromosomes fail to separate/segregate, causing uneven chromosome distribution between Daughter Cells
- Meiotic nondisjunction during 1st meiotic division leads to failure to separate homologous chromosomes (so that each daughter cell contains a sister chromatid) - This gives rise to monosomy (If Daughter Cell produced via Meiosis I that gives rise to 2 daugher gametes contains no Homologous Chromosome) or trisomy (If Daughter Cell  produced via Meiosis I that gives rise to 2 daughter gametes contains 2 Homologous Chromosomes).
- Meiotic nondisjunction during 2nd meiotic division leads to failure to separate sister chromatids - This gives rise to monosomy (If Gamete produced via Meiosis II has no Chromosomes) or trisomy (If Gamete produced via Meiosis II has 2 Chromosomes) .

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 22.59.03.png](%5B012%5D%20Cytogenetics%20f16b7da7e67c43dfa103b450a4a1420b/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_22.59.03.png)

# Trisomies

### Trisomy 21 - Down Syndrome

- Most cases arise from nondisjunction in 1st meiotic division (when homologous chromosomes are separated).
- Father contributes extra chromosome in 15% of cases.
- A small proportion of cases are mosaic and these probably arise from a nondisjunction event in an early zygotic division after fertilisation (Mitotic Nondisjunction).
- About 4% of cases arise by inheritance of a translocation chromosome from a parent who is a balanced carrier (Robertsonian Translocation).
- Symptoms include characteristic facial dysmorphologies and IQ < 50.
- Down syndrome is responsible for 1/3 of all cases of moderate to severe mental handicap.

### Trisomy 13 - Patau Syndrome

- Incidence is about 1 in 5,000 live births.
- 50% of these babies die within 1st month and very few survive beyond 1st year.
- There are multiple, severe dysmorphic features.
- Most cases, as in Down’s syndrome, involve maternal meiotic nondisjunction in the 1st Meiotic Division.
- Again, a significant fraction has a parent who is a balanced Robertsonian translocation carrier.

### Trisomy 18 - Edwards Syndrome

- Incidence is 1 in 3,000.
- Most babies die in 1st year and many within 1st month.
- A much greater proportion of Conceptions have these trisomies than the frequency seen at live birth but a large number of conceptions with these trisomies spontaneously abort

# Detection of Trisomy without Karyotyping (Molecular Methods)

1. PCR of highly polymorphic regions (highly variable regions) on chromosome of interest, notably a microsatellite.
- Would expect at least some regions to have > 2 alleles so instead of microsatellites having similar peak heights on a Genotyping Pattern in a normal individual, an individual with a Trisomy will have one peak which is 2x higher than the other (found closely adjacent to it) due to the presence of 2 alleles on the same Chromosome Type (Indicating the presence of 3 vs 2 chromosomes).
1. On a genomic microarray, many different probes are placed that are complementary to different parts of the Genome on the Chromosome. DNA is then taken from a Reference Sample and from the Px, with fluorescent tags ligated to these samples
- As Fluorescence is proportional to the amount of DNA ligated to the Probe, greater magnitude fluorescence from probes specific to DNA Sequences on the same chromosome when the Px’s DNA is added indicates the presence of additional DNA material from that Chromosome within the Sample, indicating the presence of an additional chromosome (Trisomy).
- This method can also be used to look for Chromosomal duplications/deletions by comparing fluorescence levels from probes complementary to the Chromosomal Region of Interest when the Px and Reference Sample are added
1. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) of non-dividing cells using a single region as a probe.
- Will give 3 points of identical coloured fluorescence in each cell due to the presence of 3 chromosomes.

# Numerical Abnormalities

### Sex Chromosomes

- Sex chromosome aneuploidies: because X inactivation and gene sparsity on the Y chromosome, surviving aneuploidies involving sex chromosomes can commonly occur on the inactivated X Chromosome or the Y Chromosome and hence, are far less severe and therefore, more common than those involving autosomes.
- Turner syndrome (45, X): incidence is about 1 in 500 female births, but this is tip of iceberg because 99% of Turner syndrome embryos are spontaneously aborted.
- Individuals are very short, usually infertile.
- Characteristic body shape changes include a broad chest with widely spaced nipples and may include a webbed neck.
- IQ and lifespan are unaffected.
- Turner’s Syndrome is less severe than Autosomal Aneuploidy as usually, due to males being Hemizygous and Females inactivating the X Chromosome, only one X Chromosome (which is still seen in Turner’s Syndrome) is needed for normal phenotype
- Women with Turner’s Syndrome have the same risk of X Linked Disorders as Males
- Klinefelter’s syndrome (47, XXY): incidence at birth is about 1 in 1,000 males.
- Testes are small and fail to produce normal levels of testosterone, which leads to breast growth (gynaecomastia) in about 40% of cases and to poorly developed secondary sexual
characteristics.
- There is no spermatogenesis so Px are infertile.
- These males are taller and thinner than average and may have slightly ↓ IQ.
- Many Klinefelter males lead a normal life.
- Very rarely more extreme forms of Klinefelter’s syndrome occur where patient has 48, XXXY or even 49, XXXXY karyotype.
- These individuals generally have severely ↓ IQs but these additional X Chromosomes are most commonly inactivate to prevent excessive gene dosage from the additional X Chromosomes.
- However, the additional mutations still produce effects due to increased gene dosage from Genes on the X Chromosome that escape inactivation
- 47, XYY males: incidence 1 in 1,000 male births.
- May be without any symptoms.
- Males are tall but normally proportioned.
- 10-15 points ↓ in IQ compared to siblings.
- It has been suggested that 47XYY Males are more common in correctional institutions than chance would suggest but this has been questioned.
- XXX female: about 1 woman in 1,000 has an extra X chromosome.
- It seems to do little harm.
- Individuals are fertile and do not transmit extra chromosome.
- They do have slight ↓ in IQ, comparable to that of Klinefelter’s males.

# Structural Aberrations

### Inversions

- In an inversion, a piece of chromosome has been lifted out, turned around and inserted.
- This inversion can occur via Looping out of the Inverted Chromosomal segment and then uneven crossing over at the Chromosome so that the downstream segment of the loop is now attached to where the upstream chromosomal segment looped out from and the upstream segment is now attached to where the downstream chromosomal segment looped out from, inverting the looped out chromosomal segment.
- If the Inversion includes the Segment of the Chromosome containing the Centromere, then it is a Pericentric Inversion
- If the Inversion does not include the Segment of the Chromosome containing the Centromere, then it is a Paracentric Inversion
- These Inversions are polymorphic and hence, variable across the population but if the Inversion occurs in non-coding regions of Chromosomes, they are stable
- However, during Meiosis, Recombination fails to occur between segments of the Homologous Chromosome where Inversion has occurred, causing these regions to become fixed for long periods of time as a single Haplotype, which can be used to study evolution

![Screenshot 2022-03-01 at 01.15.23.png](%5B012%5D%20Cytogenetics%20f16b7da7e67c43dfa103b450a4a1420b/Screenshot_2022-03-01_at_01.15.23.png)

### Translocations

- In a balanced translocation, Chromosomes exchange homologous segments so that there is no net gain or loss of chromosomal material, causing the chromosome to be stable and produce no effects (notably if the break site does not occur in coding regions of the Chromosome).
- However, if the break site occurs in the middle of coding, this can cause gene fusion or alterations in gene expression, with some translocation being associated with types of Leukaemias like Myeloid Leukaemias

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 23.06.57.png](%5B012%5D%20Cytogenetics%20f16b7da7e67c43dfa103b450a4a1420b/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_23.06.57.png)

- However, if Translocation occurs in Germ Cells, Meiosis will lead to the development of Aneuploid (Extra or Missing Chromosomes/Chromosomal Sections)

![Screenshot 2022-03-01 at 01.37.26.png](%5B012%5D%20Cytogenetics%20f16b7da7e67c43dfa103b450a4a1420b/Screenshot_2022-03-01_at_01.37.26.png)

# Unbalanced Rearrangements

### Deletions

- Deletions may either be interstitial (within a chromosome) or terminal (at the end of the chromosome).
- If big enough to be visible, a deletion must be removing many genes and will probably give rise to a severe phenotype as phenotype severity is positively correlated with number of genes deleted.
- Example (interstitial deletion): Angelman syndrome/Prader-Willi syndrome.
- Example (recurrent terminal deletion): Cri du Chat syndrome, where there is loss of material at end of P arm of chromosome 5, causing a reduction in cognitive abilities.

### Robertsonian Translocations

- Involve acrocentric chromosomes (chromosomes where centromere is located very near 1 end of chromosome).
- In a Robertsonian Translocation, the q arms become fused together at the Centromere whilst the p arms become fused and are lost
- People carrying Robertsonian translocations are usually normal as small p arms carry very few arms so the loss of the short arm produces little effects via gene dosage alterations.
- Moreover, the presence of the Robertsonian Chromosome does not produce effects in the Carrier as the Translocation does not produce net gain/loss of q arms of the Chromosome (where the majority of the genes are located), so the gene dosage produced in the Px does not change
- However, if their children inherit Robertsonian chromosome alongside a normal Acrocentric Chromosome, they may get trisomies.
- Example: children of someone carrying a 21/14 Robertsonian translocation will have an ↑ chance of risk offspring trisomy 21 as If the Robertsonian Translocation segregates as a Chromosome 14 (Associates with a Chromosome 14 during Segregation) instead of Chromosome 21, this will cause the gamete to inherit 2 x Chromosome 21 Long arms, producing a phenotype seen to that in a Px with Trisomy 21.
- Gametes of Px who are carriers for Robertsonian Translocations can also contain only one Chromosome of the Chromosomes involved in the RT and hence, can form Monosomies related to the Chromosomes in the RT

# Other Unbalanced Abnormalities

### Isochromosomes

- A chromosome/sister chromatids can split a ‘wrong way’ (separate along the short vs long axis of the Centromere) in mitosis (or meiosis 2) so that both long arms remain attached to one another and move to 1 pole, and both short arms remain attached to one another move to other pole.
- Consequence is formation of an isochromosome which contains 2p or 2q segments of the Chromosome.
- These Chromosomes are simultaneously duplicated for genes in retained arm found in the Isochromosome and deleted for genes in other arm of the Chromosome.
- Prognosis is poor except for iXq (isochromosome of long arm of X).

![Screenshot 2022-02-25 at 23.12.20.png](%5B012%5D%20Cytogenetics%20f16b7da7e67c43dfa103b450a4a1420b/Screenshot_2022-02-25_at_23.12.20.png)

# Ring Chromosomes

- Mutation event which removes both telomeres.
- Can be repaired by sealing both ends of the mutated chromosome together to form a ring chromosome.
- This Ring Chromosome will be deleted for genes at both ends of chromosome.
- Symptoms will depend on extent of deletion.
- Surprisingly, ring chromosomes are mitotically stable if only the telomeres at each end are deleted, allowing them to undergo Mitosis and replicate.
- Therefore, this may suggest that if Chromosomes are mitotically stable with or without telomeres (via Alterations to their shape/arrangement), this may suggest that the primary role of Telomeres is not for Chromosome stability
- Entanglement of Ring Chromosomes during DNA replication and linking during times of separation to both poles do not occur frequently
