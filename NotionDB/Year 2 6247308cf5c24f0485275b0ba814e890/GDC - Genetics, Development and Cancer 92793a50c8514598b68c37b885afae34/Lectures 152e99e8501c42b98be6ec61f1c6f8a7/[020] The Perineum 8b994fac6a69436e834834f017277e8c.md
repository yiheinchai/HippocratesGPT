# [020] The Perineum

# Sensory Innervation of the Pelvis

- Pain from the uterus and wider pelvis is visceral, meaning pain is poorly localised and referred to the lower back, suprapubic region and upper thighs (S2-4 and T12-L1 Dermatomes)
- This causes Pelvic Viscera to be pain sensitive to stretch and anoxia but not other types of stimulus
- The Anterior/Superior Aspect of the Bladder and Uterus receive their sensory nerve supply from T10-L1 via the Hypogastric Nerves (Travelling alongside SNS Fibres)
- The Cervix and Posterior/Inferior Aspect of the Bladder receive their Sensory Innervation from S2-S4 via Pelvic Splanchnic Nerves (Travelling alongside PSNS Fibres)
- In general, organs above the pelvic diaphragm (Uterus, Bladder and Upper 2/3rds of Vagina) have a visceral afferent nerve supply and those below the pelvic diaphragm they have a somatic afferent supply.
- Somatic Nerve here supply means structures found inferior to the Pelvic Diaphragm are particular sensitive to cutting, heat and touch
- Visceral afferents from pelvic structures covered by peritoneum tends to pass to lumbar spinal nerves but cutting the hypogastric nerves has not been successful for treating uterine pain.

# Lymphatic Drainage of the Pelvis

- The First Lymph Nodes that drain a tumour is known as the Sentinel Node
- Lymph nodes are found along the blood vessels and are named after those vessels.
- There are the:
1. External Iliac Nodes
2. Internal Iliac Nodes
3. Common Iliac Nodes
4. Presacral nodes - Found along the Course of the Medial Sacral Artery, just anterior to the Sacrum.
- Oncologists also count the obturator nodes (at the side of the
pelvis along the obturator artery - normally a branch of the
internal iliac) as a separate group.
- Para-Aortic Nodes are found lateral to the Abdominal Aorta and drain into the Cisterna Chyli, which is continuous superiorly with the Thoracic Duct
- Preaortic Lymph Nodes are found anterior to the Abdominal Aorta along its length and receive lymph from the GI Tract, draining into the Cisterna Chyli, back to the Thoracic Duct
- There are also nodes adjacent to the pelvic viscera which drain the viscera directly.

# Lymphatic Drainage of The Uterus

- The Uterine Body drains to external iliac, internal iliac and obturator nodes
- Lymphatic drainage of fundus and cornua may also be drained by lymphatic vessels that run alongside the Ovarian Vessels to para-aortic nodes and some lymphatics (notably from the Cornua) pass alongside the round ligament, through the Deep Inguinal Ring and Inguinal Canal to Superficial Inguinal nodes
- Any of the nodes in pelvis can receive lymph (or cancer cells) from cervix

# Important Bits To Know About Perineum

- Landmarks
- Motor nerve supply to sphincters (and other voluntary/skeletal muscle in the perineum → All supplied by the Pudendal Nerve)
- Nerve supply to erectile tissue → Preganglionic PSNS via Pelvic Sphlanchnic Nerves and Postganglionic PSNS via Cavernous Nerve from S2-S4
- Sensory nerve supply → Pudendal Nerve
- Arterial supply to perineum → Internal Pudendal Artery
- Lymphatic drainage → Medial Group of Horizontal, Superficial Inguinal Nodes

# Dermatomes of the Perineum

- Cutaneous supply mainly from:
1. Pudendal nerve (Ventral Rami of S2,3,4)
2. Ilioinguinal nerve (L1) → Supplies Anterior Aspect of Perineum, just superior to the External Genitalia
3. Genitofemoral nerve (L1 in perineum) → Supplies Anterolateral Aspect of Perineum, superior to External Genitalia, at the junction between the Perineum and Lower Limbs
4. Posterior Femoral Cutaneous nerve (S3 in perineum)
- Any striated muscle in the perineum will be supplied by the
pudendal nerve
- S2 runs down the entirety Middle of the Posterior Surface of the Lower Limb
- L3 = Medial Thigh
- L2 = Lateral Thigh and Gluteal Region

# Male Urogenital and Anal Triangle

- The Perineal Membrane is a tough membrane that spans the Width of the Anterior Perineum between the 2 Ischiopubic Ramus, Inferior to the Pelvic Floor, with a free posterior border
- In the Male, there is a Single Opening in the Perineal Membrane for the Urethra to pass through
- The Anterior Region of the Perineum that is covered by the Perineal Membrane = Urogenital Triangle
- The Posterior Region of the Perineum that is not covered by the Perineal Membrane = Anal Triangles
- The Urogenital and Anal Triangles are separated by the Coronal Plane that runs between the 2 Ischial Tuberosities
- The Perineal Body is found in the Anteromedial Most Aspect of the Anal Triangle and is attached to the Medial Aspect of the Free Posterior Border of the Perineal Membrane
- Just Posterior to the Perineal Body is the Anal Canal, which is connected to the Sacrum and Coccyx Posteriorly by the Anococcygeal Raphé
- Anteriorly, there is a Gap between the Perineal Membrane posteriorly and the Pubic Symphysis anteriorly which allows the Deep Dorsal Vein to ascend from the Penis into the Prostatic Venous Plexus

![3-s2-1.jpg](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/3-s2-1%201.jpg)

### Deep Dorsal Vein of the Penis

- The Deep Dorsal Vein of the Penis ascends along the Inferior Border of the Pubis, anterior to the Perineal Membrane to drain into the Prostatic Venous Plexus, found just superior to the Perineal Membrane, around the level of the Perineal Body

![3-s2.jpg](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/3-s2%201.jpg)

# Muscles of the Perineum

- The Deep and Superficial Transverse Perineal Muscles originate from the Ischial Tuberosity and run medially to insert onto the Perineal Body, Demarcating the Boundary between the Urogenital and Anal Triangles
- The Superficial and Deep Transverse Perineal Muscles are found inferior and superior to the Perineal Membrane respectively in both sexes
- They keep the Perineal Body in the Midline and help to support the Pelvic Viscera

![3-s2-1.jpg](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/3-s2-1%202.jpg)

# Scrotal Compartments

- Lymphatic Drainage of Testis is Pass/Fail Knowledge
- Spermatic cord and testes are covered with layers of fascia/muscle continuous with the layers of the anterior abdominal wall after the Spermatic Cord passes through the Superficial Inguinal Ring.
- The cremaster muscle (striated) surrounds the spermatic cord and can raise testis when it is cold (brings the testes closer towards the trunk, where it is warmer, to maintain a constant temperature within the Scrotum)
- When it is warm, the Cremaster relaxes to move the Testes further away from the Trunk, where it is colder, to maintain a constant temperature within the Scrotum
- It is innervated by the Genitofemoral nerve (L1 and 2)
- The testes can move as each testis is covered with its own pouch of
peritoneum (Tunica Vaginalis) which minimises friction of the testes against the Internal Spermatic Fascia when they move
- This is a double layered membrane of Peritoneum with a Visceral Layer adjacent to the Testes and a Parietal Layer in contact with the Internal Spermatic Fascia
- Dartos muscle (not part of spermatic cord - smooth muscle with sympathetic supply) can contract the scrotum (makes it wrinkly) when it is cold to reduce the SA of the Scrotum, reducing heat loss in an attempt to maintain a constant temperature within the Scrotum
- When it is warm, the Dartos Muscle relaxes, causing the Scrotum to smooth out, increasing its SA to increase Heat Loss to keep the temperature of the Testes constant
- The scrotum and the spermatic cord have protective functions
and act as climate control for the testes.
- For normal sperm production/Spermatogenesis, the testes must be slightly cooler than body temperature.

# Sensory Nerve Supply To The Scrotum

- Spinal anesthesia of the whole scrotum requires many spinal nerves to be blocked as the Dermatomes of the Scrotum arise from regions of the Spinal Cord that are far apart (T10-L1 and S2-4).
- Anterior scrotal nerves arise from ilioinguinal nerve which supply the anterior surface of the L1 dermatome, near the roof of the Penis
- Posterior Scrotal nerves arise from from Perineal branch of Pudendal Nerve supply the posterior surface of the S3/4 dermatomes (Majority of the Scrotum)
- Genital branch of genitofemoral nerve supplies part of the anterolateral surface of the Scrotum.
- Perineal branch of Posterior Femoral Cutaneous nerve supplies part of the posteroinferior surface of the Scrotum

# Testis and Epididymis

- The Testes are covered by tunica vaginalis (peritoneum) and
tunica albugina/Capsule (fibrous)
- Each testis contains hundreds of seminiferous tubules
- The Epididymis is a highly convoluted tube (around 4-5m long) formed from Efferent Ducts from the Rete Testis draining the Seminiferous Tubules within the Testes
- This is where maturation of the Spermatozoa occurs
- It originates on the Superoposterior Aspect of the Testes, where the Efferent Ducts form the Head of the Epididymis, and the Body of the Epididymis descends inferiorly along its posterior border, ending inferiorly as the Tail of the Epididymis which is continuous with the Ductus Deferens
- The Appendices of the Testes and Epididymis can be found emerging from the Epidydimis and Superposterior Aspect of the Testes and run anteriorly along the Superior Surface of the Testes
- The Appendix of the Testes is found more superiorly than the Appendix of the Epididymis
- Torsion of the Testicular Appendix (usually in boys vs men) can cause Severe Testicular Pain
- As the Testes are mobile and suspended within the Scrotum from the Spermatic Cord, Twisting of the Testes within the Scrotum can lead to Testicular Torsion, cutting off the Blood Supply to the Testes to produce Pain and potentially, Testicular Necrosis (Surgical Emergency) - Usually identified by lack of Cremasteric Reflex

![3-s2-1.jpg](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/3-s2-1%204.jpg)

# Ductus Deferens, Seminal Vesicle and Ejaculatory Duct

- The Ductus Deferens is a thick muscular tube that ascends posterior to the Epididymis, running superomedially within the Spermatic Cord through the Deep and Superficial Inguinal Rings to enter the Pelvis
- As it enters the Pelvis, it loops over the Ureter to descend inferomedially to reach the Prostate
- The Ductus Deferens opens with the Duct of the Seminal Vesicle to form the Ejaculatory Duct, which pierces the Posterior Wall of the Prostate to open up into the Prostatic Urethra
- The Seminal Vesicle produces secretions with high [Fructose] to provide Metabolic Fuel for Spermatozoa
- The Prostate Gland synthesies alkaline secretions to neutralise the Acidic Secretions of the Vagina to prevent Denaturation of the Spermatozoa during Fertilisation
- The Majority of the Seminal Fluid produced is by the Prostate Gland

# Contents of the Spermatic Cord

- Distal to the Inguinal Canal, the Spermatic Cord is surrounded by the External Spermatic Fascia, Cremasteric Fascia and Internal Spermatic Fascia moving superficial to deep
- The External Spermatic Fascia is continuous with the Aponeurosis of External Oblique on the Anterior Abdominal Wall
- The Cremasteric Fascia is continuous with the Aponeurosis of Internal Oblique on the Anterior Abdominal Wall and is the muscular layer that can contract
- Internal Spermatic Fascia is continuous with the Transversalis Fascia on the Anterior Abdominal Wall
- The Spermatic Cord contains structures in groups of 3s (Rule of 3s):
1. 3 Layers (External Spermatic Fascia, Cremasteric Fascia and Internal Spermatic Fascia)
2. 3 Arteries (Testicular Artery, Artery of Ductus Deferens, Cremasteric Artery)
3. 3 Other Structures (Ductus Deferens, Testicular Lymphatics, Pampiniform Venous Plexus)
4. 3 Nerves (Ilioinguinal Nerve, Genital Branch of Genitofemoral Nerve and Autonomic and Visceral Affrent Fibres to the Testes)
- The Ilioinguinal Nerve is found outside the Spermatic Cord, just lateral to it
- It provides motor innervation to the Muscles that insert onto the Conjoint Tendon (Internal Oblique and Transversus Abdominis) and hence, is important in protecting the Inguinal Canal
- The Genital Branch of the Genitofemoral Nerve and the Cremasteric Artery are found between the Cremasteric Fascia and the Internal Spermatic Fascia on the Lateral Side of the Spermatic Cord
- The Ductus Deferens is found in the Inferior Aspect of the Spermatic Cord, closely associated with the Artery of Ductus Deferens (From the Inferior Vesical Artery from the IIA in the Pelvis) that supplies it
- The Testicular Artery is found in the Superior Aspect of the Spermatic Cord and is surrounded by the Pampiniform Venous Plexus which forms the Testicular Vein when they reach the Deep Inguinal Ring Superiorly/Proximally
- The Pampiniform Venous Plexus cools the Arterial Blood within the Testicular Artery so to help maintain the Colder Temperature of the Testes in relation to the Core Body Temperature
- Autonomic and Visceral Afferent Nerves are also found surrounding the Testicular Artery, with pain from these nerves being referred to the area around the Umbilicus (Around T10)

# Urethra and Prostate Gland

- The Urethra descends inferiorly through the Prostate whilst the Ejaculatory Duct descends anteroinferiorly through the Prostate to join the Urethra by piercing its posterior wall, dividing the Prostate into 3 lobes:
1. Posterior Lobe - Inferior to the Ejaculatory Duct and Posterior to the Urethra → This is the region of the Prostate found anterior to the Rectum and hence, can be palpated across the Anterior Wall of the Rectum
- The Posterior Lobe contains the Majority of the Glandular Tissue within the Prostate and hence, is where most Prostatic Cancer occurs
1. Median Lobe - Superior to the Ejaculatory Duct and Posterior to the Urethra → This is the region that enlarges the most in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia
- BPH most commonly occurs in Elderly Men and when this occurs, the Prostatic Urethra becomes compressed, reducing Urine Flow and hence, causing difficulties in Urinating which leads to increased frequency of Urination, notably at night (Nocturia)
1. Anterior Lobe - Anterior to the Ejaculatory Duct → This contains little glandular tissue and hence, Cancer rarely occurs here
- The Seminal Vesicles are located just posterior to the Urinary Bladder
- Ejaculatory Duct = Ductus Deferens + Ducts of Seminal Vesicles

![Screenshot 2022-03-08 at 09.41.38.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/Screenshot_2022-03-08_at_09.41.38.png)

### Sphincters

- The Bladder Neck Sphincter/Internal Urethra Sphincter is under SNS Innervation and prevents Retrograde Ejaculation, forcing Seminal Fluid distally down the Urethra instead of Proximally/Superiorly into the Bladder
- It is made of Smooth Muscle and is found in all men and most women (it is less well developed in women than men)
- The External Urethral Sphincter is found inferior to the Prostate but extending through it superiorly, surrounding the Membraneous Urethra
- It is comprised of Striatal Muscle and is innervated by the Pudendal Nerve (S2-4)
- The Membraneous Urethra is the region of the Urethra that passes through the External Urethral Sphincter and is the narrowest part of the Urethra, except for the External Orifice
- The Prostatic Urethra is the widest region of the Urethra
- Spongy/Penile Urethra is found running within the Penis from the External Urethral Sphincter proximally to the External Urethral Opening distally
- The Urethra and Prostate Gland have smooth muscle within their walls which can be relaxed by α-blockers to Rx BPH
- Urethral Glands are found all along the Urethra and these can become infected
- Just Proximal to the External Urethral Orifice, the Urethra is enlarged superiorly to form the Navicular Fossa, which is a common site of Infection of the Urethral Glands found here (alongside the Region of the Spongy Urethra just inferior to the Perineal Membrane within the Bulb of the Penis, which is also enlarged)
- The Bulbourethral Gland is found just posterior to the Prostate Gland, superior to the Perineal Membrane and sends its duct Anteroinferiorly to pierce the Perineal Membrane and drain into the Spongy Urethra, inferior to the Perineal Membrane
- It secretes Lubricant into the Seminal Fluid to lubricate the Urethra and Penile Tip prior to Sexual Activity to minimise friction between the Penis and Vagina during Intercourse and aid the movement of Seminal Fluid down the Urethra
- The External Urethral Sphincter is found on the Superior Surface of the Perineal Membrane

# Parts of the Prostate Gland

- Pathologists and Urologists commonly refer to Concentric Zones of the Prostate:
1. Transitional Zone = 20% - This is the innermost part of the Prostate and Surrounds the Proximal Prostatic Urethra → This is mainly the Median Lobe of the Prostate
2. Central Zone = 10% - This is found Posterior to the Transitional Zone, in the region of the Prostate surrounding the Ejaculatory Duct within the Prostate, running in the same plane/down its length
3. Peripheral Zone = 70% - This is found peripheral to and surrounding the Central Zone (Predominantly the Posterior Lobe of the Prostate)

![Screenshot 2022-03-06 at 00.21.07.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/Screenshot_2022-03-06_at_00.21.07.png)

# Sympathetic Pathway to the Pelvic Viscera

- Preganglionic SNS Neurons supplying Pelvic Viscera are found within the Lateral Horn of T12-L1 (Not Sacral Sympathetic Trunk), leaving the Spinal Cord via the Ventral Ramus before entering the Lumbar Sympathetic Trunk via the White Ramus Communicantes
- It does not synapse within the Sympathetic Trunk but projects down the Lesser Sphlanchnic Nerves, which run inferomedially along the Anterior Surface of the Abdominal Aorta to enter the Pre-Aortic Plexus
- These SNS Nerves then emerge from the Pre-Aortic Plexus and synapse in the Ganglion within the Inferior Hypogastric/Pelvic Plexus, found just lateral to the Rectum
- Postganglionic SNS Neurons then emerge from the Ganglion and run towards Smooth Muscle within the Pelvic Viscera (Bladder Neck Sphincter and Ductus Deferens etc.) where it forms the Pelvic Autonomic Plexus, found just lateral to the Rectum

![Screenshot 2022-03-06 at 00.28.23.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/Screenshot_2022-03-06_at_00.28.23.png)

# Posterior Wall of the Prostatic Urethra

- There is a slight anterior bump/projection from the Posterior Wall of the Bladder Neck known as the Uvula, caused by an Enlargement of the Median Lobe of the Prostate
- Running down the Midline of the Posterior Urethral Wall, the Urethral Crest can be found which projects anteriorly into the Lumen of the Prostatic Urethra, which is enlarged at its inferior end to form the Seminal Colliculus/Verumontanum
- Lateral to the Seminal Colliculus, there are grooves into which the ducts of the Prostate Gland open up into
- Within the Seminal Colliculus, there is an opening known as the Prostatic Utricle, which ends posteriorly as a blind-ended sac within the Colliculus
- Just inferolateral to the Prostatic Utricle within the Seminal Colliculus, the 2 openings of the Ejaculatory Duct into the Prostatic Urethra can be found

![3-s2-1.jpg](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/3-s2-1%205.jpg)

# Transurethral Prostatectomy

- Instrument is inserted into the External Urethral Orifice and through the Penile Urethra to reach the Prostatic Urethra
- From this position, the Urologist can then excise the Median Lobe of the Prostate (Which expands the most in BPH) from the Posterior Wall of the Urethra, to relieve the compression of the Prostatic Urethra due to BPH
- During this Surgery, it is important to not place the tip of the Instrument below the level of the Seminal Colliculus to avoid damage to the External Urethral Sphincter
- Due to the Close Assocation between the Median Lobe of the Prostate and the Bladder Neck/Internal Urethral Sphincter, Transurethral Prostatectomy can occasionally damage the Internal Urethral Sphincter, which can lead to Retrograde Ejaculation

# Attachments of the Erectile Tissue

- Attached to the Inferior Surface of the Posteromedial Region of the Perineal Membrane, The Bulb of the Penis can be found
- The Crus of the Penis is found bilaterally, on the Posterolateral Region of the Perineal Membrane on its Inferior Surface, just medial to the Ischiopubic Ramus
- The Bulb of the Penis is continuous with the Corpus Spongiosum found on the Ventral Side of the Penis, ending Distally at the Glands of the Penis
- The Spongy/Penile Urethra is found running through the Corpus Spongiosum (Appears as a Horizontal Slit vs Round Lumen) before opening up distally as the External Meatus on the Glans, where it is seen as a Vertical Slit
- The Crus of the Penis is continuous with the Corpus Cavernosum found either side of the Midline, on the Dorsal Surface of the Penis
- The Corpus Cavernosa are the Erectile Tissue of the Penis

![3-s2.jpg](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/3-s2%205.jpg)

- The Glands is covered by very thin skin, strongly adherent to the Subcutaneous tissue of the Glans, and contains many somatosensory endings, making it extremely sensitive
- The Glans is surrounded by a fold of skin (Prepuce AKA Foreskin) which is connected to the Glans by a Frenulum on the Dorsal Side of the Penis
- The External Meatus is the narower part of the Urethra, but the next narrowest part is the Membraneous Urethra

![3-s2.jpg](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/3-s2%206.jpg)

# Male Reproductive Tract

- The Seminal Vesicle is found along the Base of the Bladder, continuous anteroinferiorly with the Prostate
- The Membraneous Layer of Superficial Fascia from the Anterior Abdominal Wall descends anterior to the Pubis and runs superficially over the Penis and Testes before ascending posterior to the Genitalia to attach to the Posterior Free Border of the Perineal Membrane
- This Superficial Fascia surrounding/encasing the External Genitalia and its attachment to the Posterior Free Border of the Perineal Membrane forms the Superficial Perineal Pouch
- If the Urethra is damaged, Urine can accumulate within the Superficial Perineal Pouch and track up into the Anterior Abdominal Wall (Anterior to the Pubic) as the Superficial Perineal Pouch is continuous with the Anterior Abdominal Wall Anteriorly
- The Urine accumulates and extends superiorly rather than inferiorly down the Limbs as the Membraneous Layer of the Superficial Fascia is attached to the Fascia Lata of the Thighs, preventing Urine from Accumulating and Tracking Inferiorly

# Erectile Tissue

- The Deep Dorsal Vein is found superficial to the Tunica Albuginea but deep to Deep Fascia, running proximally up the Penis on its Dorsal Surface
- From Medial to Lateral in the Plane between the Tunica Albuginea and Deep Fascia of the Penis, the Deep Dorsal Vein, Dorsal Arteries and Dorsal Nerve of the Penis can be found
- Helicine (Coiled) Arterioles feed blood into the Cavernosal Spaces within the Corpus Cavernosum
- These Arteries dilate under PSNS Stimulation, allowing blood to flow into the Erectile Tissue, causing the Cavernosal Spaces to enlarge, causing an Erection
- The Expansion of the Corpus Cavernosum is resisted by the Tunica Albuginea (Tough Fascia), which makes the Erection firm
- The Helicine Arteries arise from the Deep Arteries of the Penis predominantly (which run through the Centre of the Corpus Cavernosa) and the Bulbourethral Artery, found running within the Corpus Spongiosum
- At the Base of the Penis, the Internal Pudendal Artery divides into the Bulbourethral Artery (which runs inferiorly to pierce the Bulb of the Penis to run through the Corpus Spongiosum on the Ventral Side of the Penis), the Dorsal Arteries (Run Superficial to the Tunica Albuginea, lateral to the Deep Dorsal Vein, to supply the Glans) and the Deep Arteries of the Penis (Pierce the Crus of the Penis to run through the Corpus Cavernosa)

### Suspensory Ligament of the Penis

- The Deep Fascia of the Penis is attached to the Pubis to form the Suspensory Ligament of the Penis, which runs Anteroinferiorly to Wrap around the Junction of the Base and the Shaft of the Penis to attach the Penis to the Pubis
- Sometimes, the Suspensory Ligament of the Penis can be partially dissected through to lower the Penis, to give the appearance that the Penis is larger

# Skeletal Muscles of the Penis

- Bulbospongiosus covers the Superficial Surface of the Bulb of the Penis
- Bulbospongiosus contracts rhythmically during Ejaculation (and to a lesser extent in urination) to squeeze the Urethra, forcing its content (Seminal Fluid) out of the Urethra and out of the External Meatus
- Ischiocavernosus covers the Superficial Surface of the Crus of the Penis
- Ischiocavernosus and Bulbospongiosus is supplied by the Pudendal Nerve (Like the Rest of the Striated Muscle in the Perineum)
- The Ischiocavernosus contracts during an Erection to compress the Crus of the Penis against the Perineal Membrane and the Deep Dorsal Vein of the Penis, providing extra rigidity to the Penis during an erection by creating a strong attachment to the Perineal Membrane and prevent venous drainage from the Penis, causing blood to pool in the Corpus Cavernosa to prolong an Erection
- Memory Aid - ‘P for Point, S for Shoot’ - PSNS for Erection and SNS for Ejaculation

# Parasympathetic Supply to the Penis

- Preganglionic PSNS Fibres arise from S2-S4 and project down the Ventral Root into a Sacral Spinal Nerve but leaves without Synapsing via the Pelvic Splanchnic Nerves, which emerge directly from the Spinal Nerve
- The Preganglionic PSNS Fibres continue down the Pelvic Splanchnic Nerves before synapsing in a Ganglion in the Pelvic Autonomic Plexus/Inferior Hypogastric Plexus (Found Lateral to the Rectum Bilaterally)
- Postganglionic PSNS Fibres arise from the Ganglion in the Pelvic Autonomic/Inferior Hypogastric Plexus and run in the Cavernous Nerves towards the smooth muscle of the Helicine Arteries to cause it to relax, causing vasodilation

![3-s2.jpg](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/3-s2%2011.jpg)

- Pelvic Splanchnic Nerves emerge from the S1-S5 Sacral Spinal Nerves and convey PSNS and Visceral Afferent Fibres

# Cavernous Nerves

- The Pelvic Autonomic/Inferior Hypogastric Plexus contains SNS and PSNS Ganglia
- Postganglionic PSNS Fibres supply the Bladder or descend between the Prostate anteriorly and the Rectum Posteriorly to supply the Erectile Tissue via Cavernous Nerves
- Due to their close anatomical relationship with the Prostate anteriorly, they are commonly damaged in Total Prostatectomy
- Therefore, Px who have have Total Prostatectomies can commonly suffer with Erectile Dysfunction and Urinary Incontinence due to damage to the Cavernous Nerves and to the External Urethral Sphincter
- As the age of the Px with Prostate Cancer, requiring a Prostatectomy, increases, the Prognosis/Survival Rate decreases

# Nerve Supply To Male Reproductive Tract

1. Sensory Fibres in pudendal nerve innervate Glans
2. Parasympathetic fibres in Cavernous Nerves allow erectile
tissue to become engorged to produce an erection
3. Sympathetic fibres make Ductus Deferens
contract to force seminal fluid down the Urethra at the same time as bladder neck contracts to prevent Retrograde Ejaculation
4. Somatic motor fibres (via the Pudendal Nerve) make Bulbospongiosus contract to provide the main force for ejaculation

# Arteries of the Perineum

- Most of the Perineum is supplied by the Internal Pudenal Artery
- It leaves the Pelvis laterally through the Greater Sciatic Foramen below piriforms, running anteroinferiorly under the Sacrospinous Ligament and then re-enters the Perineum via the Lesser Sciatic Foramen
- Within the Perineum, it runs within the Pudendal Canal anteriorly, giving off various branches to supply the Perineum, to reach the Genitalia, ending as the Dorsal Artery of the Penis in Men or the Deep Artery of the Clitoris in Women
- As it runs within the Pudendal Canal, its first branch is the Inferior Rectal Artery, which runs medially to supply the Anal Canal

![3-s2.jpg](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/3-s2%2014.jpg)

# Pudendal Nerve

- The Pudendal Nerve arises from Ventral Rami of S2-S4, which runs anteroinferiorly to cross the Ischial Spine (where it is rather superficial and can be easily blocked with Local Anaesthetic)
- Like the Internal Pudendal Artery, it leaves the Pelvis laterally through the Greater Sciatic Foramen below Piriforms, running anteroinferiorly under the Sacrospinous Ligament and then re-enters the Perineum via the Lesser Sciatic Foramen
- It then runs within Alcock’s Canal/Pudendal Canal, where it gives off the Inferior Rectal Nerves that supply the Anal Canal and External Anal Sphincter
- More distally in the Pudendal Canal, the Pudendal Nerve gives off the Deep Perineal Branches of Pudendal Nerve, which supply all the striated muscle in the perineum.
- The Posterior Scrotal Nerves arise from the Perineal Branches of the Pudendal Nerve that supply sensation to the the majority of the Skin of the Scrotum
- The Pudendal Nerve ends anteriorly in the Dorsal Nerve of the Penis which supplies sensation to the Glans of the Penis bilaterally
- Most of the skin of the perineum is supplied by branches of the pudendal nerve but not the erectile tissue.
- If the female perineum, The Posterior Labial nerves are found instead of the Posterior Scrotal Nerves and the Dorsal Nerve of the Clitoris is found instead of the Dorsal Nerve of the Penis

# Female Perineum

- The upper 2/3 of the vagina has a visceral afferent nerve
supply but the lower 1/3 has a somatosensory nerve
supply from the Pudendal Nerve
- As the Urethra is attached to the Anterior Wall of the Vagina, Fistulas can sometimes form between the Vagina and the Urethra when the Anterior Wall of the Vagina is damaged, allowing Urine to pass into and out from the Vagina instead of the Urethra
- The Perineal Body is found between the Posterior Wall of the Inferior Vagina anteriorly and the Anal Canal posteriorly
- The Vestibule of the Vagina is the space bound between the Labia Minora laterally
- The anterior wall of the lower vagina related to the urethra
is said to be highly erogenous
- From Anterior → Posterior, you find the Pubis, Urethra, Vagina and Rectum

![Screenshot 2022-03-06 at 12.15.35.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/Screenshot_2022-03-06_at_12.15.35.png)

- The Female Perineum is identical to that of the Male but in the Urogenital Triangle, there are 2 vs 1 orifice, with the Vaginal Orifice of the Perineal Membrane found Posterior to the Urethral Orifice in the Midline

![3-s2.jpg](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/3-s2%2017.jpg)

# External Female Genitalia

- The Mons Pubis is found on the Anterior Surface of the Perineum, containing large amounts of Subcutaneous and Fibrous Tissue
- The Mons Pubis is continuous posteroinferiorly with the Labia Majora, which are Folds of Skin found just lateral to the Labia Minora
- Pubic hair can be found on the Labia Majora but not on the Labia Minora and the more medial structures of the External Genitalia
- The Vestibule of the Vagina is the space bound between the 2 Labia Minora Laterally
- The Clitoris is found anteriorly where the 2 Labia Minora fuse, which has a Shaft extending posteriorly to end as the Glans of the Clitoris
- The Clitoris is anatomically equivalent to the Shaft of the Penis, containing 2 Corpus Cavernosa
- The Glans of the Clitoris, like that of the Penis, is covered by Thin skin and contains many somatosensory endings from the Pudendal Nerve, making it extremely sensitive
- At the Posterior end of the Vestibule, the Vaginal Entrance can be found and just anterior to it, a smaller Urethral Opening can be found
- The External Portion of the Female Genitalia is known as the Vulva/Pudendum
- Sensory Supply to the Vulva is predominantly via the Pudendal Nerve however, the Anterior Region (Anterior to the Clitoris) of the Vulva receives Sensory Innervation from the Ilioinguinal Nerve medially and Genital Branch of the Genitofemoral Nerve laterally
- The Posterior Cutaneous Nerve of the Thigh contributes to the innervation of the Posterior Region of the Perineum
- In both males and females, the Lymphatic Drainage of the Perineum is to the Medial Group of the Horizontal Superficial Inguinal Node, just inferior to the Inguinal Ligament

# Female Erectile Tissue

- The Erectile Tissue of the Female is similarly named to that in the Male
- The Bulbospongiosus covers the Bulb of the Clitoris on the Inferior Surface of the Perineal Membrane, found just lateral to the Vaginal Orifice of the Perineal Membrane
- The Ischiocavernosus is found running along the Medial Border of the Ischiopubic Ramus on the Inferior Surface of the Perineal Membrane, surrounding the Crus of the Clitoris
- The Two Crus of the Clitoris fuse anteriorly to form the Corpus Cavernosa of the Clitoris in the Shaft of the Clitoris
- The Greater Vestibular Gland is found between the Bulbospongiosus anteriorly and the Superficial Transverse Perineal Muscles posteriorly
- The Greater Vestibular Gland is sometimes covered inferiorly by the Bulb of the Clitoris and contains ducts that open into the Vagina
- There are other, smaller Vestibular Glands and Paraurethral Glands which open up directly into the Vestibule

# Episiotomy

- This is performed when there is difficulties with passing the Head of the Foetus through the Birth Canal/Vagina to enlarge the Birth Canal to allow the Head of the Foetus to pass more easily out of the Birth Canal
- This can either be a Midline Incision extending posteriorly from the Posterior Wall of the Vagina towards the Anus (Most Common in the US) or a Mediolateral Incision (Runs Posterolaterally) from the Posterior Wall of the Vagina to minimise damage to the Perineal Body

![Screenshot 2022-03-06 at 12.52.13.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Perineum%208b994fac6a69436e834834f017277e8c/Screenshot_2022-03-06_at_12.52.13.png)

# Pudendal Nerve Block

- Local Anaesthesia of the Perineum can be produced via a Pudenal Nerve Block, where Local Anaesthetic is introduced around the Pudendal Nerve where it passes inferiorly under the Ischial Spine to re-enter the Perineum via the Lesser Sciatic Foramen
- To Identify the Pudendal Nerve, it is palpated through the Lateral Wall of the Vagina
- To Produce Local Anaesthesia around the Anterior Aspect of the Perineum, a Nerve Block must be introduced around the Ilioinguinal and Genital Branches of the Genitofemoral Nerve additionally
