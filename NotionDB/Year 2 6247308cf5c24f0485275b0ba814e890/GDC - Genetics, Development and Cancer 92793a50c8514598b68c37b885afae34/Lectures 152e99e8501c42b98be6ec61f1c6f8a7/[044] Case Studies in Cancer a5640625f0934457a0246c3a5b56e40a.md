# [044] Case Studies in Cancer

# Case 1 - Pancoast Tumour

- Roy Coogan, a 54-year old man, painter and decorator, lifelong moderate cigarette smoker (average 10-20 per day since his teens).
- He has had a six-week history of right shoulder reports significant pain.
- On examination he has normal breath sounds and biochemical
and haematological investigations are normal.
- The likelihood was that he sustained a brachial plexus injury when working.
- He was discharged with NSAIDs. He returns in a further three weeks with pain radiating down his right arm, miosis, and ptosis (Due to compression of Brachial Plexus and Sympathetic Trunk).
- A high resolution CT scan reveals a right sided mass in the apex of the lung.
- Therefore, Cancers can produce Sx due to their mass effect by compressing or invading surrounding structures (E.g Nerves)
- Lung cancer is indisputably the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
- Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor.

### Pancoast Tumours

- Significant risk factors: tobacco smoking
- Usually has no obvious signs of Cancer (such as weight loss, fatigue etc.) – often presumed to be Musculoskeletal in Origin
- Pancoast syndrome (shoulder/arm pain radiating to axilla, radiating to ulnar aspect of the arm to the hand).
- Dx by High resolution imaging (plain CXR may miss), therefore CT of the Thorax
- Infiltration right second rib (Indicates Tumour is malignant) → The Apex of the Lung is often very difficult to biopsy so Initial Ix is not usually a Needle Biopsy but rather a CT Scan
- Patient has Horner’s syndrome (result of interruption to cervical
innervation of the eye via compression of the Sympathetic Trunk via the Pancoast Tumour) causes Ptosis and Miosis of the Ipsilateral Side

# Case 2 - Cancer Associated Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (CA-LEMS)

- Curtis Garvey, a 65-year-old man with a seven-month history of
generalised fatigue and weakness.
- At age 65, Mr Garvey noticed he was having difficulty ascending stairs and had a ‘metallic’ taste in his mouth.
- Over the past several months he also had an unintentional 40 kg weight loss and developed intermittent dysarthia (difficulty
speaking), difficulty raising his arms over his head and erectile dysfunction.
- He is a heavy cigarette smoker (20/day for 43 years).
- Rapid Unintended Weight Loss Seen in Px with Cancer that is not improved via Nutrition = Cancer Cachexia (Key Sx of Cancer but usually a late Sx)
- Examination reveals a cachectic man with poorly reactive, dilated pupils and mild bifacial weakness.
- Reflexes are initially absent but obtainable after a brief period of exercise.

### Diagnostic Testing

1. Nerve conduction studies – action potential is typically low in LEMS.
- Other electrophysiological tests are commonly ordered.
1. Autoantibody serology via ELISA – High titre for antibodies to the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), but not for acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which rules out myesthenia gravis), or autoantibodies to muscle-specific kinase (MuSK, which rules out seronegative MG).
- Caveat: other autoantibodies can occur in CA-LEMS (such as to SOX1).
- lso, can be comorbid with MG (although rarely).
- Figure A,B shows immunohistochemistry (A) and immunofluorescence (B) of samples incubated with autoimmune serum from LEMS patients using enzyme-linked or Fluorescent Abs respectively vs the Target Protein.
- Positive staining is seen, particularly at the plasma membrane in B (green), indicating the localisation of Autoimmune Ab to the Cell Membrane where Auto-Ag are found.

1. Imaging: CXR, Chest CT and/or total body fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).
- Chest CT is most likely to be used first but if the result suggests neoplasm then FDG-PET may be useful to determine
extent of the disease.

### Treatment

- Treat the underlying cancer: General Immunosuppression (i.e., corticosteroids such as prednisone) is not recommended as it risks relapse or progression of the cancer as they suppress immune surveillance/response against Cancer Cells, allowing Cancer Cells to rapidly proliferate and progress.
- Muscle weakness typically improves on treatment of the underlying cancer.
- High dose intravenous immunoglobulin can also improve weakness due to Autoimmune Condition.
- Outcome: Fortunately, Mr Garvey’s SCLC was detected early. He was treated with chemotherapy and showed no tumour progression at 17 months.
- His neurological symptoms improved gradually.

### Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)

- Rare autoimmune disorder of NMJ
- Symptoms: gradual onset of fatigue, weakness and dry mouth
- Clinical findings: Proximal muscle weakness, reduced tendon
reflexes
- LEMS patients can have an underlying cancer (usually SCLC)

**Aetiology and Pathophysiology**

- Cancer is found in >40% cases
- Autoimmune antibodies to Voltage Gated Calcium Channels, preventing Calcium Entry into Muscle Fibres and hence, contraction
- Neurological symptoms often present before malignancy detected and hence, is a Paraneoplastic Syndrome which can be used to Dx Cancer

### Sample Question

- Which medical treatment would most likely improve Mr Garvey’s neurological condition without risking cancer progression
1. Azothiopine
2. Cyclophosphamide
3. High dose corticosteroids
4. **Intravenous immunoglobulin**
5. Mycophenolate

# Case 3 - Metastatic Breast Cancer

- At age 45, Barbara found a lump in her left breast whilst showering.
- She was otherwise healthy and unaware of any family history of cancer.
- Initial staging indicated that the tumour was 4 cm in diameter and that there was no evidence of distant spread.
- She elected for mastectomy rather than lumpectomy.
- At the time of her surgery and axillary lymph node dissection, she was found to have involvement of 8 axillary nodes but there was no evidence of distant spread.
- Histologically, her breast tumour was oestrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR) positive and HER2 negative.
- Because breast tumours are highly heterogeneous her doctors ordered gene expression analysis aimed at providing detailed molecular information that might inform prognosis and treatment.
- She was offered adjuvant radiation, chemotherapy and hormone therapy.
- Tamoxifen was prescribed because Barbara was premenopausal at the time of diagnosis.
- Barbara returned to work. After 2.8 years she began to experience intermittent bone aches and pains but she attributed these to aging and the occasional heavy lifting that her job as a nurse involved.
- Her oncologist was concerned and ordered a bone scan which unfortunately showed multiple abnormal areas on her ribs, vertebrae and pelvis
- She received the hormone treatments gonadotropin releasing hormone and later, aromatase inhibitors for 18 months.
- She also had palliative radiotherapy to painful areas of metastases in her lumbar vertebrae.
- She continued to work on light duties and was treated with several lines of chemotherapy until her performance status declined, at which point hospice care was recommended.
- Barbara died of her disease at age 53.

### HER2 as a Biomarker

- Her2, a member of the human EGFR family, is a significant human oncogene that is overexpressed in numerous cancers and approx 30% of BCs (but not in fact BN’s)
- It is a drug target and prognostic marker.
- Immunohistopathology is routine and samples are subjectively scored based on the degree of HER2 Expression on the Plasma Membrane.
- The Degree of Gene amplification is assessed by FISH to determine prognosis and indicate Rx with Herceptin.
- HER2 Level is graded 0 to 3+
1. 0-1+ = Normal HER2 Levels (Negative)
2. 2+ = Moderate HER2 Levels
3. 3+ = High (Positive)

**Indications**

- 2+ greater anti-HER2 treatment (Herceptin).
- 2+ or greater indicates a test for gene amplification to determine the number of HER2 copies expressed and hence, the prognosis of the Px as the Prognosis worsens as HER2 expression increases.

### Oestrogen Receptor Expression In Breast Cancer

- As Oestrogen is a Nuclear Receptor, OR expression is visualised via FISH where the Nuclear Staining Intensity from the OR Probe is directly proportional to the degree of OR Expression in the Cancer
- To Rx OR +ve Breast Cancer, the 2 main drugs used are:
1. Aromatase Inhibitors (Anastrazole)
2. Tamoxifen (SERMs)

### Breast Cancer

- BCs are Highly Heterogenous, containing around 20 different disease types based on different Mutational Profiles
- Due to this Heterogeneity, gene expression panels are used to identify the mutational profile of a Breast Cancer so that treatments can be selected against specific mutations to increase the efficacy of Rx.
- Oncotype Dx is an example of these Gene expression profiles that is NICE approved, with a 21-gene signature that is usually used for
Ductal Carcinoma In Situ and the risk of recurrence.
- Mammaprint is another example with 70-gene signature
- Can objectively inform treatment decisions by allowing for the identification of specific treatments that are mutation specific and hence, more likely to be efficacious

**Major Risk Factors**

- Sex: 99% female (1% male as men do have breast tissues)
- Age: >50 years
- Inherited Genetic mutation (200 fold for age <40; associated with early onset such as BRCA1 Mutations).
- Prior chest irradiation increasing the risk of malignant change within Breast Tissue
- Prolonged oestrogen exposure (i.e., early menarche) causing prolonged cellular proliferation which increases the risk of Mutation Accumulation in Proliferating Cells which can drive Malignant Transformation
- Obesity → Minor Risk
- EtOH consumption → Minor Risk

**Metastatic Breast Cancer**

- BC = most common malignancy for women in Western world
- Considerable genetic heterogeneity in presentation and prognosis
- Multi-gene expression panels are being evaluated to predict
patients who may progress from early stage BC to Metastatic BC so that early Intervention can be achieved to prevent Mortality
- 5-10% BC is hereditary (BRCA1, BRCA2 and PALB2)

**Aetiology**

- Ovarian Hormones (Oestrogen and Progesterone) which drive cellular proliferation of Oestrogen Sensitive Tissue like the Breast, increasing the risk of acquiring Mutations in DNA Replication which drive Malignant Transformation
- Genes
- Environment

### Question

- Which is the most likely TNM stage following surgery and axillary node dissection
- Answer = T2N2M0
- T2N2M0 because primary tumor is 4cm diameter, therefore T2.
- Multiple nodes contain tumour cells, therefore N2.
- There is no sign that the cancer has spread beyond the lymph nodes, therefore M0.
- Why are Aromatase Inhibitors used for the Rx of Hormone-Sensitive Breast Cancers specifically in Postmenopausal Women?
- Premenopausal women produce oestrogen primarily in the ovaries.
- In postmenopausal women by contrast, oestrogen is produced in peripheral tissues of the body (such as in the breast).
- AIs are active only against conversion of androgens to oestrogens in peripheral tissues and hence, can be used to effectively reduced Oestrogen-Mediated Tumour Growth in Postmenopausal Women but not in Premenopausal Women where Ovarian Derived Oestrogen cannot be inhibited and is the main driver of Tumour Growth.

# Case 4 - Malignant Melanoma

- The case of Andy Stevenson (62 years), a scaffolder with a growing pigmented lesion on his right shoulder.
- Andy has blond hair and pale skin, and has never sunbathed or used sunbeds.
- He reports a first degree relative and an aunt who developed “skin cancer”, he occasionally gets sunburnt but generally “covers up”.
- He has a large number (>50, all less than 10 mm diameter) of naevi/moles, which have been present from birth.
- The lesion on his shoulder is suspicious: 1.2 cm, asymmetric, variegated pigmentation, and is gradually increasing in size (cf. ABCDE criteria for evaluating pigmented skin lesions → **A**symmetric, Irregular **B**order, Variegated **C**olour (Multiple different coloured patches/spots within the Tumour), >6mm **D**iameter and **E**volving).
- It has changed shape over the last 6 months.
- He is referred to a dermatologist who performed an excisional biopsy that demonstrated a 1.3 mm thick malignant melanoma.
- Andy then underwent a wide local excision to ensure clean borders so that no malignant cells remain in the surrounding tissue, with a skin graft to cover the large segment of skin removed.

![Screenshot 2022-03-25 at 19.21.06.png](%5B044%5D%20Case%20Studies%20in%20Cancer%20a5640625f0934457a0246c3a5b56e40a/Screenshot_2022-03-25_at_19.21.06.png)

- Biopsy margins were negative as were local lymph nodes and imaging was negative for metastatic disease, as a result he was staged T2N0M0.
- Three years later Andy’s dermatologist noted new subcutaneous nodules on his upper back and right deltoid muscle.
- Biopsy of two of the lesion’s revealed metastatic melanoma.
- CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed scattered
subcutaneous nodules of the chest, back and trunk and lung metastases.
- Molecular profiling of biopsy specimens revealed the presence of the activating BRAF (V600E) mutation.
- He received targeted therapy with a kinase inhibitor (e.g.,
vemurafenib), which led to response judged by shrinkage of subcutaeneous and pulmonary nodules on CT but relapse occurred at +6 months.
- He was subsequently treated with ipilimumab (Yervoy) 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses.
- He tolerated the drug well without any significant side effects and was clear of any tumours at 4-month scan.
- There was no progression at 24 months (i.e., response was durable).
- Malignant Melanoma has a high mutational burden, with a complex mutational profile, and due to its nature as an Epithelial Tumour, it rapidly accumulates new mutations which increase the likelihood of Rx Resistance developing
- Once Melanoma has metastasised to establish malignant disease, it is usually incurable however, if a Px shows a Complete Response to Ipilimumab, this is a durable response as the Immune System has been primed sufficiently to completely eradicate

### Question

- Mr Garvey tolerated ipilimumab well but autoimmune reactions can be serious and may need to be managed. Which AI reactions are most likely to cause life-threatening conditions?

### Malignant Melanoma

- Melanoma is the third most common skin cancer, but the most
common fatal skin cancer
- Up to 20% of patients develop metastatic disease
- Prognosis depends on stage of diagnosis (<10% with MD will live
beyond 5 y)
- Advances in tumour biology, systemic treatments continue to change clinical practice

**Aetiology and Pathophysiology**

- Arises from melanocytes
- Heavily influenced by Genetic and environmental risk factors (exposure to UV radiation)
- Familial susceptibility gene CDKN2A on chromosome 9 - Cyclin Dependent Kinase which normally regulates the Cell Cycle to prevent Transformed Cells from Proliferating
- Progression of Melanoma can often be undetected as they tend to grow deep towards the Dermis rather than horizontally across the Skin, making the lesions appear as though they are not growing when looking at the skin surface when in fact, they are growing under the skin
- Major Risk Factor = Having large number of Benign Pigmented Moles which can mask the development of Melanomas on the Skin

**Complications**

- Autoimmunity which can be lifethreatening due to upregulation of the immune response, which can also be directed against normal self-Ag expressed on Healthy Cells
