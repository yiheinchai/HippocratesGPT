# [047] Introduction to Radiotherapy

# Introduction to Radiotherapy

- Radiation therapy is the medical use of ionising radiation of as part of a cancer treatment – This can be with curative or palliative
intent
- Radiation was first used for cancer treatment at the end of the 19th century.
- Modern radiation therapy is delivered by a multi-disciplinary team.
1. Clinical Oncologist → Select and Prescribe Rx
2. Therapeutic Radiographer → Administer Rx
3. Medical Physicist → Help Plan Rx to ensure that adequate dose is administered to the Px to Rx the Cancer but Minimise Side Effects
4. Medical Dosimetrist → Help Plan Rx to ensure that adequate dose is administered to the Px to Rx the Cancer but minimise Side Effects
5. Radiation Engineers → Ensures that machines are functional
- Medical Oncologists just give Px Chemotherapy but Clinical Oncologists give Px Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy

### Curative Treatment for All Cancers

- Radiotherapy is used in approximately 40% of curative
treatment regimes for cancer whereas Surgery is used in 50% and Chemotherapy in 10%.
- This can be:
1. Neoadjuvant before Surgery → E.g Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy can be given before Resection of Oesophageal Cancer to shrink the tumour so that less tissue needs to be removed
2. Adjuvant after surgery → E.g. Adjuvant Radiotherapy of the Whole Breast is given as a Follow up after Lumpectomy/ Wide Local Excision of Breast Cancer to avoid needing a Masectomy
3. Radical radiotherapy without the need for Surgery E.g. Locally advanced NSCLC
- It may be given alone or in combination with chemotherapy
(sequentially with Chemotherapy first and then Radiotherapy or concurrent/simultaneously)
- But also very important for palliative treatments e.g. pain relief

# Radiation Dosage

- Radiation Dose – Amount of radiation absorbed by tissue,
- Measured in Gray (Gy)
- Gray (Gy): – The new international system (SI) unit of radiation
dose, expressed as absorbed energy per unit mass of
tissue.
- 1 Gy = 1 Joule/kilogram = 100 rad

### Radiation Fractionation

- Tolerance
1. Not all tissues can tolerate the same dose
2. E.g kidney or lung tolerance <20Gy
3. Doses >40-60Gy usually needed to kill tumours
- Total dose is usually split into many smaller doses (fractions) which are below the tolerances of various tissues to avoid healthy tissue damage, given daily over treatment period to ensure that sufficient radiation is given to kill the tumour
- E.g. 2Gy per dosage - This is known as conventional fractionation
- Aim is to give a set dose to the tumour whilst sparing and hence, reducing collateral damage to critical adjacent normal structures due to radiation.

# Forms of Radiotherapy

### Photons

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 12.51.23.png](%5B047%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Radiotherapy%206c807dd403954fd9be48597f8f24fdaa/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_12.51.23.png)

- Most Cancers used Megavoltage Radiotherapy as Megavoltage Radiotherapy is used for deep cancers
- Due to its high energy, Megavoltage Radiotherapy does not deliver a large dose to the skin surface so it does not give rise to Skin Toxicity

### Electrons

- Allows for a smaller dose of radiation to reach the skin surface so that it does not cause skin toxicity
- The main advantage comes that with Electrons, the radiation is focused to a very narrow range of depths so they can be used to treat lesions at shallow depth (E.g Rib Metastases and Basal Cell Carcinomas) without causing significant damage to healthy tissue/structures found around the target
- Comes in different strengths (4-20MeV)

# Life Cycle of a Photon

### Linear Accelerator

- Px are placed on a Bed and a machine/scanner which emits X-Ray radiation rotates around the Px in a circle to produce images in 360° to form a 3D image
- This allows for Limited Field View CTs (Cone Beam CTs) to be conducted to ensure the Px and their internal anatomy is correctly positioned to allow for the optimum dose of radiation to be delievered to the Tumour
- The Px on the Bed can be translated, tilted and rotated within the Scanner to ensure they are correctly positioned in regards to the Scanner so that the X-Rays can be angled in the correct direction to ensure optimal delivery of Radiation to the Tumour
- Within the Linear Accelerator, there is a Radiofrequency Power Generator that releases electrons, which are accelerated towards the emitter via Magnets, before being curved and focused to a fine point by another set of magnets so that they can be fired against the tungsten Target in the Treatment Head
- This causes the release of X-Rays which travel out towards the Px to produce an image

### Photons

- Photons don’t deposit the dose within the Px as they are massless.
- Photons interact with atoms in the tissue to generate secondary
electrons through a process known as Compton Scattering
- These secondary electrons will scatter in the body and interact with matter as they slow down/decelerate, allowing them to damage DNA directly or ionise water molecules to generate ROS which can go on to damage DNA or other Cellular structures

---

# DNA Damage

- For every 2 Gy of radiation from a photon source, there is >1000 damaged bases, ~1000 single strand breaks and 40 double strand breaks
- Complex DSBs are where base damage occurs in close proximity to a double strand break and due to the complexity of the damage seen here, it can be very dificult to repair Complex DSBs.
- Most damage is rapidly repaired by Base Excision Repair, Homologous recombination (HR) or Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ).
- Unrepaired damage (due to damage being too extensive/complex) can result in cell death through mitotic catastrophe as the mutated cell reaches Mitosis with subsequent cell death through apoptosis or necrosis.
- Many tumour cells have defects in HR, meaning they are more sensitive to normal tissues to permanent damage in response to Mutagens, meaning Cancerous Cells are more likely to undergo Apoptosis/Necrosis in response to radiation and hence, die in comparison with Normal Healthy Cells

### How are Patients Treated?

- For a conventional photon treatments patients will have a 3D or 4D (3D Scan + Motion Scanning) CT scan, Patient position must be reproducible to ensure that the position and size of the structure can be accurately tracked over time so any changes in these factors are attributable to changes in the tumour rather than the positioning of the Px in the Scanner
- This scan will be used to contour the cancer and organs at risk (OARs).
- A treatment plan will be produced delivering the prescribed radiation dose to the tumour whilst sparing critical OARs to minimise side effects from the radiotherapy
- During treatment, imaging will be used to verify patient position to millimetre accuracy to be sure the radiation dose is being given as planned to the desired location, often before each fraction, using online imaging.

### Immobilisation

- Knee Supports are used so the Px is in a comfortable position where they can stay still for an extended duration of time whilst Thermoplastic Masks are used to immobilise the head to ensure the Px remains in the same position for an extended period of time to allow radiotherapy to only be administered to its intended location

---

# Conformal Radiotherapy

- GTV = Gross Tumor Volume – Identify the tumour
- CTV = Clinical Target Volume – Margin to allow for microscopic disease which are found extending from the Tumour Mass (Usually 5mm)
- PTV = Planning Target Volume – 5mm Margin beyond CTV to allow for:
1. Variation in patient set-up
2. Tumour movement
- PTV is the volume that is aimed to be covered by the radiotherapy dose in order to effectively Rx the Cancer

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 15.57.00.png](%5B047%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Radiotherapy%206c807dd403954fd9be48597f8f24fdaa/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_15.57.00.png)

### Treatment Delivery

- Modern conformal radiotherapy is delivered using volumetric arc therapy (VMAT) which uses nonstatic co-planer arcs as opposed to fixed beams, where the size of the beam at a specific angulation can be altered and fine-tuned
- This helps to fine tune/modulate the Radiotherapy beam to minimise dose to critical OARs e.g. spinal cord whilst ensuring sufficient dosage is supplied to the tumour to cause tumour death
- However we cannot defy the laws of physics, so therefore, despite these efforts, there will be some scattering of radiation due to the multidirectional diffusion of electrons produced by Compton Scattering from X-Rays, causing minor damage to surrounding tissue, causing toxicity/side effect

### Treatment Verification

- On-board imaging is used regularly following the start of Rx to ensure good patient setup using a Cone Beam CT (CBCT) to maximise the probability of a successful outcome
- Patient position can be adjusted in multiple planes by moving the
couch the patient is resting on to alter this position used for each dosage to increase the efficacy of the Rx/maximise Radiation delivery to the target if the tumour shrinks/moves location

---

# Brachytherapy

- This is when Radiotherapy is administered from an internal radioactive source found within the Body/directly inserted into the tumour target to ensure the radiation dose is concentrated in the target area where the radiation source is localised to.
- High or Low Dose Rates of Brachytherapy can be used depending on the quantity of Gy required to destroy the tumour cells and Rx the Cancer
1. Low and intermediate dose rate e.g prostate → This is where Gold Seeds are inserted through the Perineum into the Prostate, where they remain permanently to deliver very focused/localised Radiotherapy to the surrounding prostate, with minimal dose reaching the tissue surrounding the prostate
2. High dose rate e.g. cervix (requires 100 Gy of Radiation to kill the tumours cells completely and hence, due to this high dosage required, it cannot be administered from the outside via External Beam Radiotherapy or else this would cause too many side effects via the activity of X-Rays on tissues that the rays penetrate on their way to the Cervix) → Applicator is inserted into the Vagina/Uterus for 48 hrs x 3 and a Radioactive Isotope is put into position by a Vacuum Pump that moves the Isotope through the Aplicator into the Vagina, where the Isotope can deliver the radiation before being removed and later replaced whilst the applicator remains inserted
- This 3x sequence of High Dose Rate Brachytherapy allows for the delivery of large amounts of radiation to the tumour to provide sufficient dosage of radiation to Rx the Tumour, without causing side effects to surrounding tissue
- Brahcytherapy allows for more focused/localised Radiation delivery than External Beam Radiotherapy

---

# Normal Tissue Toxicity

- The radiation dose received by normal tissue can cause both acute and late/chronic side effects.
- Acute side effects develop during or in the first few months following treatment and are caused by damage to fast proliferating tissue e.g. epithelial tissue (E.g Inflammation of Mucosal Structures)
- Late/Chronic side effects occur >6 months after treatment and are caused by damage to slowly proliferating tissues or fibrosis

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 12.56.18.png](%5B047%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Radiotherapy%206c807dd403954fd9be48597f8f24fdaa/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_12.56.18.png)

# Proton Therapy

- Protons are positively charge particles produced by a cyclotron
- They require much greater infrastructure investment than photon radiotherapy.
- Their physical properties mean that there is reduced exit dose and therefore reduced radiation damage to adjacent critical OARs as the Proton Beam Does not scatter as much as the Beam produced by External Beam Radiotherapy does
- The Main Advantage of Proton Beams is that there is minimal entry dose, with the majority of the Dosage being focused at a specific depth (very narrow peak in Dose %) before causing a very low exit dose
- As Proton Beam Therapy provides a Radiation Dose at a very focused point/over a very small area, many proton beams can be modulated to spread out the Bragg Peak (Range of Depths over which maximum dose is administered) to allow for the dose to be administered over a larger area of the tumour without needing to use multiple beams, making the beam clinically useful
- Whilst Modifying the Proton Beam so that the dose is delivered over a larger area does not impact the Exit Dosage, it does cause the entry dosage to increase (still less than that seen with Photon Beam Therapy)

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 16.16.51.png](%5B047%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Radiotherapy%206c807dd403954fd9be48597f8f24fdaa/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_16.16.51.png)

### Indications of Proton Beam Therapy

**Adult → Usually Base of Skull and Spine/CNS**

- Base of Skull & Spinal Chordoma
- Base of Skull Chondrosarcoma
- Spinal & Paraspinal Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcomas (Non Ewing’s)

**Paediatric → Usually Close to Sensitive Tissues that Can Become Damaged/Transformed (Secondary Cancer) due to Traditional Radiotherapy**

- Base of Skull & Spinal Chordoma
- Base of Skull Chondrosarcoma
- Spinal & Paraspinal ‘adult type’ Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcomas
- Rhabdomyosarcoma
- Orbit
- Parameningeal & Head & Neck
- Pelvis
- Ependymoma
- Ewing’s Sarcoma
- Retinoblastoma
- Pelvic Sarcoma
- Optic Pathway and other selected Low Grade Glioma
- Craniopharyngioma
- Pineal Parenchymal Tumours (not Pineoblastoma)
- Esthesioneuroblastoma

### Conclusion

- DNA damage caused by radiotherapy is complex with multiple
forms of damage and repair pathways
- Effective radiotherapy delivery is about maximising dose to the
tumour whilst minimising dose to crucial OARs
- There are many different types of radiation that can be based on
the clinical scenario.

# Chemoradiotherapy

- Cytotoxic chemotherapy (Often Platinum Based of 5-Fluorouracil) is already commonly combined with radiation in some tumour types (Commonly Head and Neck and Cancers of the Trunk)
- The aim of radiation drug combinations with Chemotherapy is to improve the ‘therapeutic index’ where there can be control/Rx of the Tumour whilst minimising toxicity
1. Radiosensitisation of tumour tissue → This increases the response of Cancerous Cells to the radiation so that smaller doses of Radiation can be given to destroy tumour cells whilst the use of smaller doses means that there is reduced risk of causing toxicity to normal tissue
2. Radioprotection of normal tissue allowing increased dose delivery to be administered to completely destroy Cancerous Tissue but there is a reduced risk of toxicity occurrring at the high dose of radiation (this has been shown to be quite difficult to specifically achieve)

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 13.55.51.png](%5B047%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Radiotherapy%206c807dd403954fd9be48597f8f24fdaa/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_13.55.51.png)

### Non-Interactive Combinations

- Spatial co-operation
1. Radiotherapy to treat local disease at the site of the primary lesion
2. Chemotherapy for microscopic disease which may found at sites far from the Primary Lesion
- Debulking
1. Tumour debulking with the use of sequential chemotherapy (Chemotherapy and then Radiation) can reduce the volume of the Tumour to such an extent that it allows the remainder of the shrunken cancer to be Rx by radiotherapy without the need for surgery

### Examples

**Radiation + Temozolamide for Glioblastoma Multiforme**

- Temozolomide generates 0-6-methylguanine base
modifications
- MGMT is the methyltransferase which repairs this modification that is introduced into DNA by Temozolomide
- Stupp trial from 2005 showed that for those patients with
Glioblastoma Multiforme who had MGMT whose promotor was methylated, they benefitted from having Radiation alongside Temozolamide as it caused longer disease-free survival vs just Radiation.

**Chemoradiation for NSCLC with Consolidation Durvalumab**

- Durvalumab is an anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody which prevents T Cell Inhibition by Tumour Cells to stimulate T Cells to targets and kill the tumour cell
- It produces a significant benefit when given after chemoradiation
- It is unclear if there is an interactive or non interactive benefit produced by the combination.

# Radiation For Brain Metastases

### What to Know as a Junior Doctor?

- It is important to avoid Rx Interruptions and if there a potential interruption arises/occurs, catch up doses can be administered to ensure the Px is back on track with their Rx Regime to maintain the effectiveness of the Rx

### Background

- Brain metastases develop in 10-30% of adults with cancer.
- This may be increasing with greater use of MRI leading to
greater diagnosis of Brain Metastases and improved systemic treatments like chemotherapy leading to prolonged survival.
- Most common primaries that can metastasise to the brain are: lung (50%),breast (15-20%), unknown primary (10-15%), melanoma (10%), colorectal (5%).
- 1/3rd to 1/4th of patients will present with
solitary metastasis; breast, colon and renal tumours are
often solitary, lung and melanoma often present with
diffuse disease

### Symptoms

- About two-thirds of patients with brain metastases will develop neurologic symptoms whilst the rest will be ASx.
- Most patients present with progressive neurological and cognitive dysfunction (specific Sx based on the localisation of the Metastasis) due to expanding tumour or oedema around the tumour.
- 40-50% will have headaches.
- One-third will present with cognitive dysfunction(memory
loss, mood/personality changes).
- Focal neurologic signs(weakness) are seen in 20-40%.
- Steroids are important to decrease oedema.
- Load with 16mg then follow with 8mg twice a day of dexamethasone
- When administering Dexamethosone, it is important to give PPI + blood glucose to protect against Gastric Ulceration and Steroid-Induced Diabetes
- Anticonvulsants are necessary only for patients who present with seizures.
- Asymptomatic brain mets indicates that there is little inflammation and cerebral oedema so the Px probably doesn’t need steroids acutely
- Px who have a poor prognosis do not benefit from Whole Brain Radiotherapy, with Steroid Administration being less invasive but producing a similar degree of clinical improvement
- If Px have Isolated Metastases (e.g Oligometastatic Disease with 1-3 Metastases), these Metastases can be removed via Surgery or Stereotactic Radiosurgery instead of Whole Brain Radiotherapy to reduce side effects

### Whole Brain Radiotherapy

- Px is treated 20 Gy Dose of Radiotherapy in 5 Fractions over 5 Days if a Px has Diffuse Metastases

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 17.40.51.png](%5B047%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Radiotherapy%206c807dd403954fd9be48597f8f24fdaa/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_17.40.51.png)

### Focal Radiotherapy Rx

- If a Px has isolated, Single Metastases or Oligometastases, more Focal Radiosurgery using Cyber Knife or Stereotactic Radiotherapy Gamma Knife can be used to produce very focal removal of the Metastases with minimal damage to surrounding tissue

---

# Spinal Cord Compression

### Evidence For Surgery

- Patchell led a randomized trial comparing surgery followed by RT vs. RT alone for patients presenting with cord compression to assess whether Px with Spinal Cord Compression benefit from surgery.
- Surgical intent was “to remove as much tumour as possible, provide immediate decompression of the spinal cord and stabilize the spine”.
- Both groups received the same steroids at the same dose and the same dosage of Radiotherapy (30 Gy)
- Study stopped at interim analysis due to the sheer magnitude of difference seen between the two groups.
- More surgery patients were able to walk after therapy with Surgery and RT than patients with RT alone: 84% vs. 57% (p=0.001)
- Surgery patients retained ability to walk for longer periods of time: 122 days vs. 13 days (p=0.003)
- Surgery patients maintained continence longer.
- Survival NOT different: 129 days surgery vs. 100 days RT
- 16 patients in each group entered study unable to walk –surgery
patients had greater chance of regaining walking ability: 62% vs. 19% (p=.01)
- Less need for steroids and opioid analgesics in surgical group.
- Hospitalization length was 10 days for both groups

**Spinal Cord Compression Due to Metastases Summary**

1. Important to get appropriate scan of the Px (MRI or CT where not possible)
2. Important to get Hx of Neurological Deficits (Notably those who have been Immobile and the duration of this + extent of weakness as duration of immobility due to leg weakness is negatively correlated with probability of recovery of function)
3. Steroids + Urgent Radiotherapy (20 Gy split into 5 Fractions with discussion with Surgeon) - All whilst consulting Local Guidelines

### Exit Dose

- When a Dose of Radiation is administered to Px, the Dosage will continue beyond the target tissue (Exit Dose) and hence, will expose and damage nearby tissues found along the path of the Radiation to cause Toxicity based on the Magnitude of the Exit Dose
- Notably, when Radiotherapy is administered in the Abdomen from a Posterior Source, the Exit Dose will pass through and act on the Bowel, where it can cause Nausea and Diarrhoea, requiring Ondansetron to combat Nausaea
