# [037] Case Study - Carcinoma of the Uterine Cervix SPL

# Epidemiology

- Colposcopy: diagnostic procedure to examine an illuminated,
magnified view of the cervix, and tissues of the vagina and vulva

### Epidemiology

- 2nd most frequent women’s cancer worldwide.
- 500,000 new cases and 200,000 deaths/year.
- 10% of women’s cancer-related deaths.
- 80% of cases occur in developing countries as there is less developed screening processes here and reduced access to HPV Vaccines, increasing the risk of Cervical Cancer here.

### Pathogenesis

- Transformation zone: columnar epithelial cells from the cervix are constantly changing into squamous epithelial cells which line the vagina at the transformation zone found at the External Os.
- This is the most common place on the cervix for abnormal
cells to develop as metaplasia at this transformation zone predisposes oncogenesis here.
- During Puberty, the Cervix everts into the Vagina so that at the External Os, there is a superficial ring of Non-Keratinised Stratified Squamous Epithelium with a deep ring comprised of the Transformation Zone
- In the transformation zone, it is a normal process for the
squamous epithelium to overgrow the Columnar Epithelium (metaplasia) in response to the harsh acidic environment of the Vagina (Reversible Change)

# Precursors to Invasive Carcinoma of the Cervix

- Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN): subjectively graded from
1-3, relating to what proportion of the Cervical Epithelium in 1/3rds is Dysplasic
- Stem Cells proliferate and move apically, where they usually lose the ability to proliferate and form a layer of Stratified Squamous Epithelium on the Apical Surface of the Epithelium
- In Cervical Dysplasia, Dysplastic Stem Cells that proliferate and migrate Apically do not lose the ability to proliferate and so, as the degree of Dysplasia increases (From CIN1-3), the thickness of the Epithelium that is comprised of Dysplastic Cells also increases
- CIN3 represents in-situ carcinoma, where the basement membrane is still intact.

# Diagnosis of Cervical Carcinoma

### Cytology (Looking At Cells On A Slide And Seeing What They Look Like)

- Cells scraped from cervical transformation zone indicate state of
tissue.
- This forms the basis of smear (formerly Papanicolaou smear), which is a screening test to sample the Cervical Transformation Zone and look for evidence of Dysplasia at the Apical Surface of the Transformation Zone (Cells should be Squamous).
- Previously, these sampled cells were placed on Slides and analysed via Cytology but now, Sampled cells are suspended in a Liquid Medium where they are analysed via Molecular Methods for the Presence of High Risk HPV Strains
- If High Risk HPV Strains are present, the Cells are then extracted and analysed via Cytology to determine the degree of Dysplasia and hence, the risk of Cancerous Cells being present
- Normal squamous cells: large cells with lots of light pink cytoplasm with Pyknotic Nuclei (Very condensed nuclei that form when cells are necrotising).
- As Cells become more dysplastic (and risk of Cervical Cancer Increases), Nuclear:Cytoplasm increases whilst the Cell decreases in size, with the Cytoplasm becoming more blue and darkly stained

### Colposcopy

- Use acetowhite stain, which causes swelling of epithelial tissue,
columnar and any abnormal squamous epithelial areas.
- This depends upon the amount of nuclear proteins and cytokeratin
present in the epithelium.
- When acetic acid is applied to normal squamous epithelium, little coagulation occurs in the superficial cell layer, as this is sparsely nucleated however due to the high nuclear:cytoplasm in Dysplastic Cells, there is lots of coagulation so Dysplastic Cells stain white (Often in a Cobblestone arrangement).
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-03-26 at 19.12.28.png](%5B037%5D%20Case%20Study%20-%20Carcinoma%20of%20the%20Uterine%20Cervix%201b4d7c87b99d4cf1a9c037ee1ba60cde/Screenshot_2022-03-26_at_19.12.28.png)
    
- Immunosuppression seen in AIDS Pxs means that AIDS Px often present with Cervical Carcinoma, where Acetowhite causes Lesions to appear extremely white and protrude from the Cervical Surface

### Histology of Cone Biopsy

- Cone Biopsies are conducted by removing the Inferior Most Aspect of the Cervix where the External Os is found

![Screenshot 2022-03-26 at 19.15.43.png](%5B037%5D%20Case%20Study%20-%20Carcinoma%20of%20the%20Uterine%20Cervix%201b4d7c87b99d4cf1a9c037ee1ba60cde/Screenshot_2022-03-26_at_19.15.43.png)

- Whether or not basement membrane is intact or not determines if it is an in-situ carcinoma or invasive carcinoma.
- In CIN3, the entire thickness of the Cervical Epithelium appears highly granular and densely staining (whereas normally, the Epithelium stains less intensely and appears less granular moving apically)

### Dx of Cervical Cancer

1. Smear Abnormality - HPV +ve and then Cytology to look at Degree of Dysplasia
2. Colposcopy - Direct visualisation of the Cervix
3. Biopsy (CIN Grading)

# Risk Factors of Cervical Carcinoma

- Early sexual activity.
- Multiple sexual partners.
- Immunosuppression (HIV infection).
- Smoking
- Oral contraceptives
- Infection with oncogenic HPV (16 and 18).
- There are at least 100 HPVs with some being cutaneous, others genital-mucosal in their infection sites but not all are oncogenic.
- A feature all HPVs share in common is that they all infect squamous epithelium and are transmitted by direct contact.

# What is HPV?

- Unenveloped, dsDNA virus with a Circular Genome.
- It contains Early (E) Genes encoding proteins required for replication (Oncogenes) and Late (L) genes encoding proteins required after replication such as Capsid Proteins via L1
- Capsomeres self-assemble without the need for enzymatic action to form an icosahedral capsid
- An HPV infected squamous epithelial cell is a koilocyte - its
cytopathic effect causes nuclear enlargement, irregularity of
nuclear membrane contour, darker nuclear staining (hyperchromasia) and a clear area around the nucleus (perinuclear
halo).

### HPV Infection

- Due to Microlesions in the Cervical Epithelium, HPV can pass through the Cervical Epithelium and infect Basal Stem Cells
- Inside the Infected Cell, the HPV Genome is integrated into the Host Genome, where it becomes attached to Chromosomes being replicated and subsequently transmitted onto daughter cells when the Infected Cell proliferates
- In the Basal Stem Cell Layers, the Expression of E Genes in the HPV Genome prepare the Virus for DNA Replication but as the Infected Daughter Cells differentiate as they move apically and stop proliferating, the expression of L1 and L2 allow for Viral DNA Replication and Virion formation to occur
- When the Infected Cells reach the Apical Surface of the Epithelium, Viral Release occurs as the Apical Squamous Cells are shed of into the Lumen
- Due to the Infection of Basal Stem Cells that do not migrate, this allows the HPV Infection to remain latent in these cells, protected from Immune Destruction to produce a Latent Infection

# How HPV Causes Cancer

- HPV is necessary but not sufficient so that HPV infection is able to cause infection but additional dysfunction within an HPV Infected Cell is required for Cancer to arise.
- Infections mainly occur around 20-25 Years of Age and decrease with increasing age, whilst the incidence of Cervical Cancer increases over time, indicating that Cervical Cancer develops years after initial infection occurs
- In many individuals, Infection with HPV is cleared by the Immune System but in some situations, Immunological Factors allow HPV Infection to Persist.
- As the Virus persists and Infected Cells replicate in the presence of Cofactors that promote Oncogenesis, HPV Infection leads to Cellular Dysregulation, leading to High Grade CIN and hence, Invasive Cancer
- When the virus integrates into the cell, the genome is can no longer be circular as the human genome is linear, not circular.
- When the HPV Genome becomes linear and is integrated into the Host Genome, E2 Expression becomes Disrupted, causing Virus Replication to cease (as the HPV Genome is now Linear Vs Circular and there is reduced E Gene expression which is required for Viral Replication), leading to Overexpression of E6 and E7
- ↑ expression of E6 promotes degradation of p53 via ubiquitination, blocking apoptosis causing cell immortality (persistence of Mutated Cells).
- ↑ expression of E7 interacts with pRb, stopping cell cycle arrest which allows mutated cells to progress through the cell cycle and proliferate to cause cancer progression.

# HPV Vaccines

- Must induce neutralising antibodies that are specific for High Risk HPV Genotypes in particular to reduce the risk of Infection by High Risk HPV Strains and hence, the risk of Cervical Cancer
- The Main Target for Neutralising Antibodies is L1, which forms the Major HPV Capsid Protein
- HPV cannot be grown in tissue culture (therefore, recombinant DNA technology is used to produce L1 Capsid Proteins from Transgenic Organisms which can then self-assemble to form a HPV-Like Particle that is comprised solely of the Capsid).
- Virus like particles (VLP): These are produced by manufacturing L1, which self-assembles into a capsid are the major component of HPV Vaccines and are responsible for the generation of HPV Specific Immunity.
- These are not infectious as they do not have DNA and hence, cannot replicate to produce Infection so they only produce a HPV-Specific Immune Response.

### Gardasil

- Quadrivalent: HPV 6, 11, 16, 18.
- Protects against 70% of cervical cancers, and 90% of genital warts (HPV 6, 11).
- 2 intramuscular doses over 6-12 months to produce systemic immunity.
- Gardasil 9 is a Nonavalent Vaccine targeted against 9 HPV Strains, producing Immunity against HPV 6, 11, 16, 18 alongside other Strains which can give rise to Cervical Cancer, providing further protective immunity against Cervical Cancer
- Given prior to sexual activity so that protective immunity is established before potential exposure to HPV during Intercourse.
- Routine immunisation for all girls aged 11-14 years, with catch up doses occurring in Px aged 15-25 if doses are missed previously.
- Despite a well established vaccination regime, routine cervical screening continues, notably in elderly women where HPV Infections may occur later in life due to reduced Protective Immunity from the HPV Vaccine.
- Routine Immunisation of boys is cost effective as whilst Males will not develop Cervical Cancer, not immunising men would establish a reservoir of HPV Infection within the Male Population which increases the risk of Genital Warts and Cervical Cancer occurring within the Female Immunised Population
- Since the Introduction of the Gardasil HPV Vaccination, the Rates of Infection with High Risk HPV Strains and the Incidence of CIN3 and Cervical Cancer have significantly decreased however, the later that an individual is immunised, the more likely they are to develop Cervical Cancer and CIN3 due to an infection with a High Risk HPV Strain

# What Other Diseases Might the HPV Vaccine Prevent

- It is likely to be effective against other HPV associated cancers like:
1.  Vaginal
2. Vulval
3. Anal
4. Penile
5. Some head & neck

---

# Summary

- Cervical cancer is common
- HPV & host co-factors cause cervical cancer
- “High risk” HPV genotypes can cause progressive dysplasia/carcinoma
- Viral aetiology has major implications for screening & immunisation
- Vaccination against most of the high risk HPV genotypes (incl 16 & 18) is in the UK vaccine programme
