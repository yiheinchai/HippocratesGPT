# Precision Medicine and Drug Reactions

- Precision Medicine was initially understood to be the consideration of an individual’s Genetic Background in the selection of drug treatments in order to maximise their effectiveness and minimise side effects but now considers other aspects of an individual’s internal environment such as the Microbiome, Metabosome and Drug Metabolism
- Therefore, the best modern definition is an emerging approach for disease prevention and treatment that takes into account people’s individual variations in genes, environment and lifestyle
- Whilst Licensed Drugs have been shown to be efficacious and safe on a population level, It has been estimated that only 30-70% of Px respond positively to these on an individual level (notably for Cancer)
- Therefore, Precision Medicine seeks to tailor specific drugs to an individual (via analysis of an individual’s genetic background and microbiome etc.) to increase the efficacy of the drug in the Px and minimise side effects (Select Specific Drugs for Px based on their individual internal environment)
- To develop Precision Medicine, you need access to Health System Data on a Px, Omic Data about Genome, Transcriptome etc. and the Microbiome/Environment of the Px, Px Life Style
- As many of the factors that are considered in Personalised Medicine can change over time, personalised medicine for a Px needs to be regularly reviewed and updated to change drugs to a more effective drug if needed
- As the same tumour type can produce different transcriptome’s in Px, this alters the genetic background in which the tumour is found in the Px and therefore, the same drug given to the same Pxs will have different efficacies, so precision medicine analyses these different transcriptomes and identifies the most efficacious drug for the Px in each case
- Personalised/Stratified Medicine is concerned with Mendelian Genetic Diseases (Genetic Diseases), with medications being developed to target this specific mutation in the Px to prevent the disease phenotype from manifesting
- This means that whilst Different mutations may produce the same outcome so Personalised Medicine uses different drugs to target these different mutations to prevent the disease outcome in all Px despite this variation
- Stratified/Personalised Medicine benefits clinicians as it improves success rate of Rx and improves drug safety/minimises ADRs and benefits Px as it more effectively treats the condition
- One of the main challenges of Precision Medicine is that is requires large amounts of processing power to collect the large volumes of information about the Px, analyse the data and report findings to recruit Px to test the efficacy of the personalised drugs on (from which data is taken), requiring tight integration to be successful

# Adverse Drug Reactions

- Adverse Events (AE) = Any untoward medical occurrence that may present during treatment with a pharmaceutical product but which does **not necessarily have a causal relationship** with this treatment
- Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) - Any noxious change which is **suspected to be due to a drug**, that occurs at doses normally used in man and  requires treatment or decrease dose or indicates caution in future use of the same drug
- Therefore, an adverse drug reaction is an adverse event with a causal link to a drug
- ADRs have a large financial burden on the NHS, which can be minimised via Precision Medicine to minimise side effects associated with drugs and maximise their efficacy

# Drug-Drug Interaction

### Fluoxetine/Prozac

- In babies whose mothers take Prozac in pregnancy, risk of:
1. Autism
2. Babies born undersized
3. Breathing problems
4. Heart defects
5. Cleft palates
- In some depressed children and young adults, risk of:
1. Increase suicidal thoughts, attempts & self-mutilation (~4%)
2. Violent behavior, mania & aggression, nightmares
3. Sexual dysfunction
- Fluoxetine commonly interacts with Adderall and Trazodone where excessive 5-HT release can cause Serotonin Syndrome

# Drug Response

- Pharmacogenetics has been defined as the study of variability in drug response/efficacy due to heredity/genetic factors (mainly coding regions of DNA).
- More recently, with the suffix ‘… omics’ to design areas of research, the term ‘pharmacogenomics’ has been introduced.
- While the Pharmacogenetics is largely used in relation to genes determining drug metabolism, the latter is a broader based term that encompasses all genes in the genome (Coding and Non-Coding Segments) that may determine drug response (AKA Pharmacogenetics + Wider Genome Studies)

# Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms

- SNPs can occur in Non-Coding Segments of DNA where they can alter the expression of nearby genes, the Conformation of the DNA and Enzyme Binding
- Therefore, wide variation in SNPs found within the Population can alter the expressions of proteins that help dictate the Pharmacodynamics of the Drug and therefore, can alter the efficacy of a drug
- 12 genes (45 SNPs) associated with a drug response or a dosage indication which alter drug efficacy and optimal dosage

# E-Prescribing

- When Px requires prescription, Px will enter prescription order online, which will be sent to the Pharmacist electronically
- The Pharmacist will then verify the prescription as being appropriate in drug identity and dosage for the Px (considering factors like Drug Hx, Condition, Age etc.) and if appropriate, dispense the drug
- In the future as Precision Medicine Develops, verification of Drugs by the Pharmacist is set to include checking the drug choice against the Px’s Genetic, Lifestyle and Environmental Hx to ensure that the correct drug is selected at the right dosage to maximise efficacy and minimise side effects for the Px
- Pros - E-Prescribing will reduce Clinician errors due to additional verification to make prescriptions safer for Px, Increases Dr Productivity as there is less demand on the Dr to verify the Prescription before they send it to the Pharmacist
- Cons - As Entire Px data is stored within a system that can be accessed by multiple individuals, there are concerns regarding security/privacy of Px information

# Companies Offering PGx Analysis and e-Prescribing Tools

- PGxOne - Analyses Biomarkers in a Px within the Genome, notably SNPs, to analyse a Px’s Pharmacogenetics to suggest recommended drug treatments
- This produces a chart indicating for a specific Px’s health condition, which drugs can be administered at a standard dose, which need an altered dose (higher or lower), which should be used with caution and which should be avoided

- Pharmacokinetics looks at the changes in [Drug] over time whereas Pharmacodynamics looks at the changes in Effect with [Drug]
- PK/PD is when data from Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics is combined to look at the effect of the Drug in the Body over time by eliminating the common [Drug] variable

# Human Genome Project

- Carried out in 2003 and sequences all 3.3 million bps of the Human Genome
- Each Person carriers around 10 million SNPs and the aim of the project was to establish the connection between SNPs and drug response variability
- These SNPs can influence the activity of Drug Metabolising Enzymes and Drug Transporters (to alter Pharmacokinetics - Dose Selection) and alter the activity of Drug Targets (to alter Pharmacodynamics - Drug Selection), both of which give rise to variable drug efficacy/toxicity within the population

### Goals for Personalised Medicine

- Identify genetic difference between people that affect drug response
- Develop genetic tests that predict and individual’s response to a drug
- Tailor medical treatments to the individual to increase their effectiveness and minimise adverse side effects
- Pharmacogenetics: evaluates how an individual’s genetic makeup
corresponds to their response to a particular medication.
- Pharmacogenomics: combines pharmacogenetics with genomic
studies.
- Uses large groups of patients to evaluate how candidate
drugs interact with a range of genes and their protein products.

# Precision Medicine Challenges

- How can Stratified Medicine be efficiently implemented in the health system and keep it frequently regulated to maintain its efficacy? - CDx testing, e-prescribing tools, multi-omics analysis
- What will be the cost of such implementation?
- Who is going to pay for it? Would it work better in a public or a private health care system?
- Where is the evidence that Stratified Medicine will be beneficial for patients as there might be significant privacy risks involved in many parties having access to significant information regarding a Px?
- There is a need for better tools and frameworks within current healthcare systems in order for efficient implementation of Precision Medicine
