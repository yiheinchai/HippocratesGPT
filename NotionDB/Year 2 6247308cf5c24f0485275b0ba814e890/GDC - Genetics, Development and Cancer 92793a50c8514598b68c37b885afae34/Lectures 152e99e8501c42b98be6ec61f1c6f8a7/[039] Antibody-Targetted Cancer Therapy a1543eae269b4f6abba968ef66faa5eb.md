### Antibodies Cause Cell Death

- Main approaches for marketed antibody drugs
1. Direct biological effects related to specificity.
2. Fc mediated effects.
3. Immune stimulation e.g. checkpoint inhibition.
4. T cell engagement.
5. Drug Carriers to deliver a cytotoxic drug to a specific tissue site by selecting a mAb specific to a tumour Ag e.g. antibody drug conjugate (ADC).
- Many successful antibody drugs Rx cancer through multiple mechanisms

### Development of Monoclonal Antibodies

- If B Cells and Myeloma Cells (B Cell Cancers) were fused to form a Hybridoma, each Hybridoma formed would proliferate continuously in Vitro (Due to the Immortality and Autonomous Growth of the Myeloma) and secrete a specific mAb, corresponding to the Ab produced by the B-Cell, in large quantities
- Whilst these mAb were effective within Mice, they could not be extracted and used in Humans as Anti-Drug Antibodies as they were Immunogenic, stimulating Anaphylactic Responses (as the mAb were recognised as non-self by the Human Immune System) and having rapid clearance via the generation of Human Anti-Mouse Abs

### Making Murine Ab More Human

- As Human and Mouse Ab are structually similar, Using Recombinant DNA Methods, it is possible to graft entire Fvs from Mice to Human Ab (Chimerisation) to form a Chimeric mAb with Mice Fv Regions whilst the rest of the Ab was Human
- Alternatively, Recombinant Technology can be used to graft 6 Individual CDRs from Mice to Human Abs (Humanisation) to form Humanised mAbs with Mice CDRs whilst the rest of the Ab was Human

### Antibodies

- Each B Cell Clone makes a different Ab and a large number of different Ab specificities can be created as part of the Adaptive Immune Response
- When a stem cell changes to become a B cell, DNA segments for
both heavy (VDJ) and light (VJ) chains are randomly combined.
- Each B cell ends up with functional genes for making 1 light and 1
heavy chain coding for an antibody as a membrane-bound
receptor.
- Over 15,000,000 combinations of variable, diversity and joining
gene segments are possible, with Imprecise recombination and
mutation ↑ variability into billions of possible combinations which corresponds to billions of different Ag specificities.

### Basic Structure

- Almost all antibodies made for cancer treatment are IgG1, or are
fragments of them
- It is a homodimer of dimers, comprised of 2 identical Heavy and Light Chain Regions.
- A Heavy and Light Chain segment are bound to one another to form a dimer, with 2 dimers being connected to one another via a Hinge Region so that each Ab contains 2 Fab and 1 Fc Region
- Hinge region contains 2 disulphide bonds to connect the Light and Heavy Chains of One Dimer together as well as connecting 2 Dimers together to form the completed Ab.
- This gives the antibodies flexibility to allow different Fvs of one Ab  to bind multiple Ags on Multivalent Ags to increase Avidity .
- Fc region: Fragment Crystallisable. This region determines the Ig Class and recruits specific immune system components to determine the effector function of the Ab
- Fab - Fragment Antigen Binding. This contains the Fv (Variable Fragment) at its distal tip is comprised of VH and VL and contains 6 CDRs/Hypervariable Regions, 3 on each VH and VL(Formed by expression of VDJ Gene Combination) that determine the Binding/Ag Specificity of the Ab

![Screenshot 2022-03-13 at 12.05.02.png](%5B039%5D%20Antibody-Targetted%20Cancer%20Therapy%20a1543eae269b4f6abba968ef66faa5eb/Screenshot_2022-03-13_at_12.05.02.png)

### Fv CDRs and Frameworks

- The Fv is the only region of the Ab that is required to allow for the Ab to bind to the Ag
- Each Fv contains 6 CDRs at its distal tip so in one Ab molecule, there are 12 CDRs between the 2 Fabs
- CDRs are found at the distal tip of the Fab region and come together to form a Unique Conformation that is specific to their Ag
- This Specific/unique conformation is maintained and supported/stabilised by the relatively constant components of the remainding VH and VL Regions
- Therefore, to Humanise a Mouse Ab, you need to replace the Fv Region of a Human Ab with that of a Mouse mAb so that the Human Ab now has the Ag specificity of the Mouse mAb but is unlikely to be recognised as non-self and hence, stimulate immune responses → This forms a Chimeric mAb
- To maximally humanise a Mouse mAb, you need to graft individual CDRs from the Mouse mAb onto a Human Ab instead of grafting the entire Fv region to minimise the proportion of the Ab that is non-self and hence, minimising the immunogenicity of the Ab → This forms a Humanised mAb

### Making Completely Human Antibodies Using Mice

- This can be done by using Transgenic Mice where the Mice Ig Genes have been replaced by Human Ig Genes
- The Transgenic Mouse is then immunised with a Cancer Ag and B Cells specific to the Ag are collected, fused with Myeloma Cells to form Hybridomas which produce large quantities of a mAb
- As these Hybridomas contain Human Ig Genes, they produce Human mAbs that can be harvested and used without any risk of Immunogenicity
- Therefore, Mouse, Chimeric and Humanised Mab can be generated by Antibody Enigeering whereas Fully Human mAbs must be made by Transgenic Mice containing Human Ig Genes

# Early Antibody Therapies

- Antibodies were discovered over 100 years ago and horse
antiserum was used in 1980s to treat tetanus and diphtheria
- However, the Horse Serum was Immunogenic and caused ‘Serum Sickness’ as the serum was a complex and undefined mix of different Ab and other proteins so was not used further to develop modern drugs

---

# Fc Effector Functions

- Fc Effector functions are mediated by the Fc region of the Ab binding to Various Ligands on different cells (notably Immune Cells) to stimulate different pathways and hence, producing different effector functions
- Just Below the Hinge Region at the Proximal Tip of the Fc Region, FcγRs can bind to allow the Ab to mediate Antibody Dependent Cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Antibody Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP)
- Just Lateral to the Region where FcγRs bind at the Proximal End of the Fc Region, C1q can bind to mediate Complement Mediated Cell Lysis
- Distal to the Complement Domain of the Ab Fc (In the Middle Segment of the Fc Region), FcRn (notably expressed on Endothelial Cells) can bind to allow for Ab to enter the cell (to avoid metabolism) and then leave the cell to re-enter the circulation to increase the t1/2 of the Ab
- At the Proximal base of the FcγR Binding Region there is a highly Glycosylated Area to facilitate the binding of FcγR to the Fc Segment and hence, the degree of Glycosylation here can be altered to change the affinity of the Fc Region of the Ab for FcγR

# FcRn Extend Circulatory t1/2 of Abs

- When proteins are endocytosed into cells, Decrease in Endosomal pH causes parts of the Proteins to dissociate from the rest of the molecule and transported to the Lysosome to be degraded to produce Molecules that can be utilised by the Cell
- In Serum, as the pH is neutral (7), the Ab is unable to bind to FcRn expressed on the outer surface of the Cell Membrane
- When Ab are taken up by Endosomes formed from the Cell Membrane into Endothelial Cells, pH of the Endosome decreases to pH = 6, which allows the Ab bind to FcRn expressed on the Inner surface of the Endosome
- This prevents the Ab from being taken up into a Lysosome and degraded, causing the Ab to persist within the Endosome
- This allows the Ab within the Endosome to be recycled via Exocytosis and released from the Endosome, prolonging the t1/2 of the Ab (Notably IgG1) to around 3 weeks
- Therefore by altering the degree of interaction between the mAb and the FcRn, this allows the t1/2 of the mAb to be altered so that it persists in the circulation long enough to be effective but not so long that it can accumulate and cause side effects

# Anti-Tumour Mechanisms Mediated by Fc

1. Antibody Dependant Cell Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC) → This is mainly mediated by NK Cells binding to the Fc region of the Ig via their FcR, causing them to release Perforins which create pores in the Tumour Cell Membrane, allowing Granzymes to enter the cell and trigger Cell Lysis
- This is an example of an Avidity effect as the More Ab that are present on the surface of the Tumour Cell, the more likely it is that they will bind to an FcR on the NK Cell and trigger ADCC
1. Antibody Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis (ADCP)
- Ab on the Tumour Cell Surface bind to FcRs on the Surface of Phagocytes, causing Phagocytosis of the Tumour Cell, allowing for the lysosomal degredation of the tumour cell within the Phagocyte
- These cells can then present Ag from the tumour cell on MHC Class II to become APCs and trigger an Adaptive Immune Response Vs the Tumour Cell Ags
1. Complement Dependant Cytotoxicity (CDC)
- Ab binds to tumour cell via Fab and accumulation of Abs in a small region of the Cell Membrane allows the Fc of these Ab to Bind to C1q, activating the Complement Cascade to produce Lysis of the Tumour Cell via the Membrane Attack Complex

![Screenshot 2022-03-16 at 19.58.03.png](%5B039%5D%20Antibody-Targetted%20Cancer%20Therapy%20a1543eae269b4f6abba968ef66faa5eb/Screenshot_2022-03-16_at_19.58.03.png)

# Specific Anti-Tumour Antibodies

### Rituximab

- This is a Chimeric Anti-CD20 mAb formed from Mouse Fv Regions and Human Fc Regions
- Used in B cell lymphoma.
- Proposed therapeutic mechanisms: CDC, ADCC, apoptosis.
- CD20 is a transmembrane protein that is involved in B Cell Development but is also expressed on Haematological Malignancies
- Rituximab binds to CD20 on both normal cells and malignant B cells and hence, can cause destruction of both Malignant and Healthy B Cells.
- As it does not target stem cell lineage or plasma cell, The Px is still able to amount a normal Humoural Response and produce new B Cells to replace those that were destroyed, allowing the Px to recover

### Transtuzumab (Herceptin)

- Anti-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) approved
by FDA in 1998.
- Used in breast cancer that are HER2+ve (Often have worse prognosis than those with HER2-ve Breast cancer).
- Humanised antibody constructed from mouse CDRs - Remainder of the Ab is human IgG1.
- Proposed therapeutic mechanisms: inhibit activity of growth signals that promote proliferation, differentiation and survival by preventing HER2 Dimerisation, ADCC, ADCP and stimulating immune response vs Tumour Cell by inducing tumour cells to express Tumour Associated Ag.
- HER2 is a gene that helps control how cells grow, divide and repair themselves.

### Indirect Effect on Cancer Cells

- Bevacizumab
- Humanised IgG1
- Bevacizumab binds directly to VEGF to inhibit Angiogenesis of Tumours, this inhibits Tumour Growth and promotes Tumour Necrosis to Rx the Cancer

# Armed Antibodies - Drugs Toxins Radioactivity

- The most well developed armed Ab class is Ab Drug Conjugates (ADCs) which use the Ab’s Specificity to deliver a toxic chemotherapy drug to the Tumour, where the attached drug can kill the tumour (but Fc-Mediated mechanism of the mAb can also contribute to cell destruction)
- As many of these small toxic chemotherapy drugs could not be used systemically alone due to their toxicity however, when coupled to mAb, the specificity of the mAb allows for the focused delivery of the chemotherapy so that it can be administered systemically to Rx the Cancer without destroying surrounding tissue

### Brentuximab Vedotin

- Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) is an anti-CD30 chimeric mouse/human IgG1.
- It is linked to Monometyl Auristan E (MMAE) which is a Tubulin Polymerisation inhibitor.
- Approved in more than 65 countries, including Brazil, Japan, the United States and countries in the EU for the Rx of Hodgkin Lymphoma and Systemic Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma.
- The mAb consists of Brentuximab Vedotin, with a Protease-Cleavable Linker (allows the Cytotoxic Drug to separate from the mAb once the complex is inside the cell) and MMAE
- Following Binding of Brentuximab Vedotin to CD30, it is endocytosed and within the Vesicle, Proteases cleave MMAE from the mAb
- MMAE then goes to inhibit Tubulin Polymerisation, causing Microtubule Disruption which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
- Due to the presence of the Protease-Cleavage Linker, the MMAE can be cleaved from the mAb and diffuse out of the cell to act on Adjacent Cells (Healthy or Tumour Cells) to trigger Apoptosis here
- MMAE can also enter the rER where it causes Stress within the rER which can lead to changes in Protein Modification so that Tumour Proteins can be presented on pMHC to stimulate an Immune Response against the Tumour Cell
- Brentuximab Vedotin itself can remain bound to CD30 on the surface of the Tumour Cell where it can stimulate Immunogenic Cell Death via the direct activity of the mAb or Ab-Dependent Cellular Phagocytosis via its Fc Region

# Immune Modulation - Checkpoint Inhibitor Antibodies

- Check Point Inhibitor Abs stimulate T Cells and are important in overcoming the immunosuppressive effects of the Tumour Microenvironment that can be seen in many solid cancers, to allow an Immune Response to be mounted against the Tumour Cell to destroy it

### CTLA-4

- CD28/B7.1 or B7.2 binding provides a costimulatory signal for T cell
activation following TCR/pMHC Class II Binding.
- Activated T cells express CTLA-4 - a protein that competes with CD28 for B7 to reduce T Cell Activation via CD28/B7.1 or B7.2 signalling to regulate the immune system to prevent Autoimmunity/yHypersensitivity.
- Anti-CTLA-4 antibodies prevent CTLA-4 from binding to CD80/86 to inhibit T Cells, allowing B7 to bind to CD28 and hence, allow for T Cell Activation.

![Screenshot 2022-03-16 at 23.44.58.png](%5B039%5D%20Antibody-Targetted%20Cancer%20Therapy%20a1543eae269b4f6abba968ef66faa5eb/Screenshot_2022-03-16_at_23.44.58.png)

### Immune Checkpoints and Monoclonal Antibodies In Clinic

- Ipilimumab: Anti-CTLA-4 Human IgG1 mAb produced from Transgenic Mice (Checkpoint Inhibitor).
- In 2001, it set a new standard of care for patients with melanoma however it is not as effective as other Checkpoint Inhibitors as it does not target molecules expressed on tumour cells and hence, is not selective for enhancing the Tumour Immune Response.

### PD-1

- PD-1 is a checkpoint protein expressed on T Cells that binds to PD-L1/PD-L2 on APCs/Tumour Cells to prevent T Cell Activation
- Its ligand, PD-L1 and/or PD-L2 can be expressed on Tumour Cells as well as APCs to directly prevent Tumour-Mediated Immunosuppression to allow for the selective Enhancement of Immune Responses directed against the Tumour Cell
- mAb can be generated that can block PD-1 on T Cells or PD-L1/PD-L2 on the Tumour Cell/APC

### Stimulating The Immune System Can Be Very Dangerous

- 13 March 2006: new drug trial put 6 men in intensive care.
- Novel drug, TGN1412 (CD28-SuperMab → Created to directly stimulate CD8+ Cells without the need for additional stimilation from receptors already expressed on the CD8+ Cell) caused multiple organ failure in 6 men injected with it at Northwick Park Hospital.
- TFN1412 is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal antibody (IgG4 to render its Fc Region inactive).
- It is a super agonist, stimulating immune system and causing a cytokine storm.

# Immune Modulation

### Single Chain Fv Fragments (ScFv)

- ScFvs are the VH and VL domains of Fv tethered by a flexible linker which holds the 2 V Regions together to provide it with stability
- ScFv retain the binding capacity of the whole antibody (as it the Fv Region of the Ab that binds the Ag due to the CDRs within the Fv), although they are only monovalent as each Fv only binds 1 Ag.
- They can be used as the building blocks for other Ab-Based Drugs as due to their small size, they can be easily cloned, notably by bacteria to allow for their mass production

![Screenshot 2022-03-17 at 00.20.29.png](%5B039%5D%20Antibody-Targetted%20Cancer%20Therapy%20a1543eae269b4f6abba968ef66faa5eb/Screenshot_2022-03-17_at_00.20.29.png)

### Production Method

- ScFv can be expressed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage, which allowed the phage to bind specifically to a single antigen, allowing specific Bacteriophages that contained the VH and VL Genes to be identified and isolated
- This meant that there was no need to synthesise mAbs in their entirety anymore as VH and VL genes can be obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from various methods before being transduced into Bacteriophages.
- These methods include:
1. Human B cells (donors).
2. Immunised animals
3. Transgenic mouse with human immunoglobulin genes.
4. Synthetic or semi synthetic human v genes are also used (for
example a human antibody with synthetic CDR H3s).
- Bacteriophages that contained specific VH and VL Genes which expressed them on their surfaces could then be grown significantly to create a vast library of various VH and VL Genes, each with a different Ag specificity, contained within a specific Bacteriophage
- As the VH and VL Genes were expressed by the Bacteriophages on their surface, this meant that the Bacteriophage Phenotypes are linked to their Genotypes, which allows for the identification of the specific phage with the desired gene so that it can be captured to isolate the desired Ab gene
- From this Library, one Bacteriophage of each specificity can be added to the target Ag bound to a plastic surface/cell so that the Bacteriophage expressing the VH and VL with the highest specificity for the Target Ag will bind to the Target, allowing that Bacteriophage to be identified so that its VH and VL genes can be captured to synthesis a VH-VL Fv Fragment that can be used therapeutically and is specific to the target Ag
- These libraries can be used for applications such as:
1. Antibody discovery.
2. Humanising without CDR grafting (chain shuffling)
3. Affinity maturation (mutate and select tightest binders).
4. Selecting for antibodies that bind in specific conditions (E.g Low pH).
5. It’s very fast compared with hybridoma technology.
6. ScFv and phage-derived antibodies have been used in blockbuster drugs.
- Once the specific ScFv fragment specific to the Ag of Interest has been identified, the ScFv can be combined with the remaining segments of an Ab to form a complete IgG molecule or used as a building block for many other therapeutic Ab formats that are selective for the Ag of interest

# ScFvs Uses

### Bi-Specific T Cell Engagers (BiTes)

- These are small proteins comprised of paired ScFvs, with one binding to the Tumour Ag and one binding to CD3 on the T Cell to form an Immunological Synapse that activates the T Cell to allow it to induce Apoptosis in the Cancer Cell via Perforins and Granzymes
- Blinatumomab: targets CD19 antigen present on B cells.
- In a phase I clinical study, patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
showed tumour regression and, in some cases, complete remission.
- Licensed by FDA in December 2014 for B Cell Precursor Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia.

### Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)

- ScFv is cloned into the T Cell to replace the TCR so that one end can bind the Tumour Specific Ag and the other is bound to the Signalling domains of the TCRζ Chain (Signalling Portion of TCR) and additional Costimulatory Domains from other Cell Surface
- 1st Generation CARs just bind to the Signalling Domains of the TCRζ Chain, 2nd Generation CARs bind to the TCRζ Chain + CD28 or 4-1BB whilst 3rd Gen CARs binds to CD28 + CD28 + 4-1BB
- When the ScFv binds to its Target Tumour Ag it induces T Cell Activation directly to allow the T Cell to directly destroy the Tumour Cell
- This is conducted by removing T Cells from the Px and Virally Transducing these T Cells with the Lentivirus or Retrovirus so that the T Cell Expresses the CAR
- These CAR T Cells are then grown In Vitro and infused into the Px, where the CAR T Cells can now bind specifically to Cancer Cells via Cancer Ag and kill them to Rx the Infection (These are often used as Last Line)

- KYMRIAH (Tisagenlecleucel) is a CD19- directed CAR-T therapy.
- In August 2017, it became the first FDA approved treatment to include gene therapy.
- n February 2019 The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approved Kymriah for treatment of adults with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
