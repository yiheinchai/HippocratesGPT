# [UMP2002] Drug Receptor Interactions : Agonist and Antagonist

# Drug Binding

- Agonists bind to their receptor reversibly so that A + R ⇌ AR
- As this is an equilibrium reaction, the equilibrium position is described by the Binding Affinity Constant of the Drug to the receptor (Kₐ)

- If the bound complex AR can then be activated/open (becoming AR*) via a reaction called 'Gating', where the receptor conformation is changed
- This is described by the equilibrium constant E (efficacy)
- The position of equilibrium for the activation reaction of a receptor is then described by the binding (Kₐ) and Gating (E) reactions

- Glycine is a full-agonist for the Glycine Receptor whilst Taurine is a partial agonist for this receptor
- These ion channels bound to Glycine are open 96% of the Time whilst those bound to Taurine are only open 54% of the time

- Full and Partial Agonists differ in the responses that they elicit due to differences in their Gating Reaction/E (Their binding reaction is the same)
- For Full Agonists, E is large, causing the equilibrium position of the Gating Reaction to shift towards AR* (Activated/Open Channel), meaning a large proportion of receptors are open and a larger maximum response can be reached
- Full Agonists have a high efficacy
- For Partial Agonists, E is small, causing the equilibrium position of the Gating Reaction to shift towards AR (Inactivated/Closed Channel), meaning a small proportion of receptors are open and a small maximum response can be reached
- Partial Agonists have a low efficacy

# Modulators

- Drugs can affect receptors by changing the receptor response to a primary agonist/neurotransmitter to increase/decrease the action of the Primary Agonist
- E.g Benzodiazepines (Diazepam/Valium) bind to a site on the $GABA_A$ Ionotropic Receptor (different to where GABA binds) to increase the effect of GABA on this channel to cause sedation.
- Hence, Dia**zepam** (Benzodiazepines) is a positive allosteric modulator for the   $GABA_A$ ****Receptor

- Synaptic currents determine brain activity, with GABA introducing Inhibitory currents (Negative Deflections on Trace)
- In the presence of Benzodiazepines like Flura**zepam**, these inhibitory currents are of a larger amplitude, producing sedation and sleep

# Antagonists

- Antagonists block the activity of receptors
- Pure Antagonists bind to the receptor but do not change it (Binding Reaction occurs as normal)
- However, no Gating Reaction follows the binding reaction (no receptor activation), so E/Efficacy = 0

![Screenshot 2021-10-02 at 16.14.02.png](%5BUMP2002%5D%20Drug%20Receptor%20Interactions%20Agonist%20and%20A%203a22f8d7f2674a65967ced65a54df61c/Screenshot_2021-10-02_at_16.14.02.png)

- There are 2 ways antagonists can block receptors:
1. Competitive Antagonists - Bind to the same site as the Agonist to stop Agonist binding
- E.g Strychnine is a competitive Antagonist that blocks the effects of the Glycine Neurotransmiter on the Glycine Ion Channel by binding to its Agonist Site and Occupying it so Glycine cannot bind
1. Non-Competitive - Antagonist blocks the receptor activity produce by an agonist but do not stop the Agonist binding
- For Ionotropic Receptors, NC Antagonists can enter the channel pore when it is opened by an Agonist and stop ion flow through the Channel
- E.g Picrotoxin (PTX) is an Open Channel Blocker blocks binds inside the channel pore of inhibitory ion channels, at the level of the membrane, away from the Agonist Binding Site

### Distinguishing Competitive and Non-Competitive Agonists

- The structure of a receptor bound to the Agonist would tell us where the agonist binds and where it is acts
- This is not always possible as membrane proteins are hard to crystalise
- The two antagonist types can be distinguished by looking at dose-response curves and checking whether the maximum response changes
- If the Antagonist is competitive, there will be no change to the Maximum Response (Antagonism can be overcome by increasing [A])
- If the Antagonist is non-competitive, the Maximum Response will be lower  (Antagonism can't be overcome by increasing [A])
- Competitive Antagonists do not lower the Maximum Response as Antagonist-Receptor Binding is also reversible so binding of the Agonist and Antagonist reach an equilibrium with one another, with the Equilibrium position depending on Affinity and [ ]

# Surmountable Antagonism by a Competitive Mechanism

- TPMPA is a competitive antagonist of the $GABA_C$ receptor
- Whilst Competitive Antagonism doesn't decrease the Maximum Response, a larger [ ] is needed to reach the Maximum Response as the Agonist must outcompete the Antagonist
- This causes a parallel shift (Right Shift) to higher [Agonist] and reduces the potency of the agonist (EC₅₀ increases)

# Unsurmountable Antagonism by a Non-competitive Antagonist

- If the Antagonist is a channel blocked, the block cannot be overcome by adding more Agonist.
- The more you increase [A], the more the channel opens, so the more it is blocked by the channel opener, causing the Maximum Response to decrease

# Pharmacology and Clinical Medicine

- When developing drugs, Target Selectivity is the most important property of a drug
- Extremely high potency can make a drug difficult to administer safety, having a low margin of safety and hence, making overdoses common

### Non-Selective Drugs

- Hexamethonium - Blocks all nAChRs in Autonomic Ganglia (SNS and PSNS). It does decrease BP but its widespread side effects made it obsolete
- Atropine - Blocks all mAChRs

### Selective Drugs

- H₂ Blockers (Ranitidine) - Block Histamine 2 receptors with an antiulcer effect. They have no effect on H₁ receptors (targeted by antihistamines to treat hay fever)
- Atenolol - Selective for β1 ARs (Heart and Renin Secretion in Kidneys) and spares β2 AR (Bronchi) and so safer in Asthmatics than non-selective blockers like Propanolol
- It is always best to select the most Selective Drug

# Antagonist Affinity and Receptor Subtypes

- The right shift in the Agonist Dose-Response Curve upon the addition of a Competitive Antagonist tells us the position of equilibrium between the Competitive Antagonist and the Agonist on the Receptor Binding Sites
- The bigger the shift, the better the Antagonist is outcompeting the Agonist
- The size of this shift is dependent on [Antagonist] and the affinity of the Antagonist
- Affinity of the Antagonist is determined by the structures of the Antagonist and Receptor
- If a competitive antagonist has different affinities for receptors in different organs, those receptors are different (this can be used to develop selective drugs)
- The Pharmacological classification of receptor subtypes is based on the use of Competitive Antagonists and varying affinities (derived from Dose-Response Curves)
- Binding Affinity for a competitive antagonist can be measured easily whilst that for the Agonist is very hard to measure

- Reversible Competitive Antagonists cause a right shift of the dose-response curve, the extent of which is dependent only on [Antagonist] and its affinity for the receptor ($K_B$)
- $K_B$ = Dissociation Constant and is expressed in units of [ ]
- The extent of the shift (r) and the Antagonist Affinity for the receptor ($K_B$) are linked by the Schild Equation (NO NEED TO LEARN THIS EQUATION)
- $r-1 = \frac{[B]}{K_B}$ Where B = Antagonist
