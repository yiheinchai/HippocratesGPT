- Dependence-producing and is a major medical and public health problem.
- Estimated > 90% of adult population in UK drink alcohol.
- Alcohol dependence is estimated to occur in 5% of adults.
- Effects: sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anaesthetic.

- 35% of A&E admissions are alcohol-related.
- 70% of A&E admissions between midnight and 5 am are alcohol related.
- Alcohol is estimated to be responsible for 250,000 admissions annually to NHS hospitals in England.
- Alcohol related diseases account for 1 in 8 NHS bed days (about 2 million) and 1 in 8 NHS day cases (about 40,000).
- 1.2 million incidents of alcohol-related crimes/year.
- Each year in UK:

# Units of Alcohol

- 1 UK unit is 10 ml pure ethanol.

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 13.28.45.png](%5BUMP2030%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Recreational%20Drugs%20(Alco%20cd67c96fe78a4ca0a93ab41c0d5314d8/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_13.28.45.png)

- Percentage alcohol by volume (ABV) of a drink is equivalent to number of units of alcohol in 1 litre of that drink.
- This is more accurate way to determine number of units of alcohol consumed than units.
- A wine containing 14% ABV has 14 units in 1 litre. If you drink 250 ml, equivalent to 2 small glasses (or 1 large glass), you have consumed 3.5 units.
- $Units=\frac{Volume(ml)consumed√óABV}{1000}$

# Absorption

- Alcohol passes rapidly from stomach into small intestine where it is absorbed rapidly into blood by diffusion.
- Rate of absorption: influenced by factors such as presence of food (particularly high-fat food) in stomach.
- Peak blood alcohol concentration:
1. 30-60 min (in absence of food in stomach).
2. 1-2 hour (when stomach contains food) but may be longer.
- Breathalysers are based on the fact that a small but consistent proportion of alcohol is excreted in the breath and urine
- Alcohol is oxidised in the Liver before it is excreted in the Urine

# Effect of Alcohol

- Causes CNS depression (similar to effects of volatile general anaesthetics).
- Paradoxically, alcohol causes feelings of euphoria and enhanced self-confidence (these apparent stimulatory effects are due to depression of inhibitory control mechanisms/disinhibition in brain).
- With ‚Üë concentrations, intellectual performance and sensory discrimination ‚Üì and at very high concentrations, can cause death via respiratory depression.
- Degree to which function of CNS is impaired is ‚àù to concentration of alcohol in blood.

### Blood Alcohol Levels

- Typically, 1 unit of alcohol ‚Üë blood alcohol levels by 15 mg/100 ml.
- Alcohol is metabolised at a rate of 15 mg/100 ml/hour (roughly 1 unit/hour), irrespective of amount consumed.

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 13.31.53.png](%5BUMP2030%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Recreational%20Drugs%20(Alco%20cd67c96fe78a4ca0a93ab41c0d5314d8/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_13.31.53.png)

- 80 mg/100 ml = 35 Œºg/100 mol on Breath and 107 mg/100 ml in Urine
- Alcohol has a low therapeutic index

### Distribution

- Whereas many drugs remain in extracellular fluid, ethanol is distributed into total body water.
- Volume of distribution is 0.7 litres/kg.

### Bottle of Wine Consumed by an 80kg Medical Student

- Wine of 12% ethanol by volume.
- Typical bottle is 750 ml. ‚Üí
- Dose is 0.12 √ó 750 = 90 ml ethanol.
- Relative Density/Specific Gravity of ethanol is 0.82.
- 90 ml of ethanol (90 √ó 0.82 ùëî = 74 ùëî).
- For an individual of 80 kg, volume of distribution (0.7 litres/kg) is 0.7 √ó 80 = 56 ùëôùëñùë°ùëüùëíùë†.
- So 74 g of ethanol is distributed in 56 litres.
- 1 litre of body water contains 74g/56ùëî = 1.32 ùëî ethanol.
- Therefore, assuming no metabolism, blood alcohol level is 132 mg/100 ml.

# Units of Alcohol

- Prior to 2016, UK Government‚Äôs advice was that consumption of alcohol should not exceed:
- 21 units/week for men.
- 14 units/week for women.
- However evidence suggests that many do not comply and that:
- 27% of men drink > 21 units/week.
- 15% of women drink > 14 units/week.
- In January 2016, advice was modified to: 14 units/week for men and women (spread over 3 days or more) ‚Üí This is current advice.
- 1.7 million men and 0.6 million women are classified as heavy drinks (> 35 units/week for men, > 22 units/week for women).

# Physiological Effects of Alcohol

- Alcohol promotes:
- Vasodilation
- Gastric secretion
- Urine production
- Liver damage
- Male impotence
- As with many drugs of abuse, alcohol stimulates the mesolimbic dopamine pathway (reward pathway).
- This reinforcement can be both +ve and ‚Äìve.
- +ve reinforcement of alcohol consumption due to pleasurable and euphoric effects.
- ‚Äìve reinforcement of alcohol consumption due to its effects on the relief of stress.
- Primary effect is CNS depression.
- Intellectual performance and sensory discrimination impaired.
- Evidence for dementia with chronic abuse.
- In pregnancy, associated with foetal alcohol syndrome.
- Potentiates effects of other drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines on GABA-A Receptors).

### Alcohol Induced Liver Damage

- Alcohol can cause severe long-term effects on liver as it is the main site of alcohol metabolism.
- Fatty liver: first stage of liver deterioration in heavy drinks.
- Chronic heavy alcohol consumption can put a high metabolic demand on the liver, leading to accumulation of fatty acids as the liver is unable to metabolise FAs.
- This can lead to death of liver cells via Ischaemia and formation of fibrous scar tissue (fibrosis) which can be reversible, which can lead to permanent damage (cirrhosis).

### Other Long-Term Effects

- Other pathologies associated with chronic alcohol abuse:
1. Wernicke-Korsakoff encephalopathy: confused state resulting from thiamine deficiency.
2. Iron and folate deficiency anaemia
3. Cardiomyopathy
4. Peripheral neuropathy

---

# Ethanol Receptors

- Due to its low receptor specificity, there is evidence for alcohol modulating of functional properties of:
1. Acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)
2. ATP receptors (P2X Rs)
3. 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors (5HT3Rs)
4. ùõæ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAARs)
5. NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs)
6. Glycine receptors (GlyRs)
7. Voltage-gated Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channels (VGCCs)
- This often involves potentiation of Inhibitory Receptors and inhibition of Excitatory Receptors

---

# Metabolism

- In contrast to many drugs, where rate of drug metabolism ‚Üë with blood concentration, rate of metabolism of alcohol is linear and almost independent of concentration (15 mg/100 ml/1 unit per
hour).

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 18.05.29.png](%5BUMP2030%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Recreational%20Drugs%20(Alco%20cd67c96fe78a4ca0a93ab41c0d5314d8/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_18.05.29.png)

- Ethanol, being highly lipid soluble, is readily absorbed by stomach and small intestine.
- Effects occur within 5-10 minutes and can last several hours.
- Ethanol is oxidised in liver to acetic acid by 2 enzymes:
1. Alcohol dehydrogenase
2. Aldehyde dehydrogenase
- Both enzymes require cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD).
- Linear rate of ethanol metabolism is due to limiting supply of NAD which limits the rate of these reactions.

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 18.07.08.png](%5BUMP2030%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Recreational%20Drugs%20(Alco%20cd67c96fe78a4ca0a93ab41c0d5314d8/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_18.07.08.png)

# Genetic Polymorphism

- Major cause of variability in ability of individuals to metabolise alcohol is due to genetic polymorphisms within the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).
- Polymorphism in ALDH (common in Asian populations) results in substantially ‚Üì ability to metabolise aldehyde.
- This can make alcohol consumption aversive due to acetaldehyde accumulation.
- Alcoholism is almost non-existent in individuals with this genetic polymorphism due to this aversion.
- Mutations that enhance the Activity of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase lower Acetaldehyde levels and hence, may predispose an individual to Alcoholism

---

# Metabolism of Methanol

- Formaldehyde is much more toxic than Acetaldehyde as it can interact with Dehydrogenase enzymes in the Retina to cause Blindness
- This makes Methanol ingestion much more dangerous than Ethanol Ingestion

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 18.12.00.png](%5BUMP2030%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Recreational%20Drugs%20(Alco%20cd67c96fe78a4ca0a93ab41c0d5314d8/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_18.12.00.png)

# Alcohol-Induced Hangover

- More than 75% of drinkers report that they have experienced hangover symptoms at least once.
- Symptoms begin, typically, several hours after consumption when blood-alcohol levels are falling and persist for a few hours.
- Symptoms:
1. Headache
2. Diarrhoea
3. Nausea
4. Fatigue
5. Sensitivity to light and sound.
6. Tremor, sweating and ‚Üë pulse.
- Also diminished dexterity and visual-spatial skills, even after alcohol can no longer be detected in blood.
- Severity of hangover may not be solely dose-related. May be influenced by other products of alcohol beverages  (e.g. congeners, present in dark spirits) and dehydration.
- There is evidence for alcohol-induced handovers being responsible for significant economic costs due to work absence and ‚Üì performance.

---

# Tolerance

- Tolerance: ‚Üì effect associated with prolonged exposure is one of main causes of ‚Üë alcohol consumption in order to reach desired effects.
- Large doses consumed after tolerance has developed are associated with long-term toxicity (e.g. liver damage).
- Development of tolerance to alcohol appears to be influenced by genetic determinants and may be associated with development of alcohol dependence.

---

# Withdrawal

- Physical withdrawal symptoms: can begin within hours of abstinence and typically last for a few days.
- Symptoms:
1. Tremor
2. Sweating
3. Nausea
4. Confusion
5. Hallucinations (delirium tremens)
- Craving: can persists for much longer than physical symptoms of withdrawal.
- Anxiolytic drugs: (e.g. benzodiazepines) are sometimes used to treat symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, but their use is not
recommended if an individual is likely to continue to drink alcohol as combined usage of Benzodiazepine and Ethanol can lead to Respiratory Depression.

---

# Drugs

1. Disulfiram: aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor, used to make consumption of alcohol unpleasant (aversion therapy) due to the accumulation of Acetaldehyde.
- Accumulation of Acetaldehyde causes Tachycardia, Headache, Nausea and Vomiting
- The main problems with its usage is that it can have low conformity where Px stop taking the Drug to reduce the unpleasant effects associated with Alcohol Consumption
1. Acamprosate: NMDA receptor antagonist. ‚Üì craving for alcohol in alcohol-dependent patients during abstinence from alcohol.
2. Naltrexone: opiate antagonist. ‚Üì euphoria associated with Alcohol use, hence reducing alcohol induced reward.
3. Chlordiazepoxide: long-acting benzodiazepine. Alleviates symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal, but they also have potential to cause dependence.
