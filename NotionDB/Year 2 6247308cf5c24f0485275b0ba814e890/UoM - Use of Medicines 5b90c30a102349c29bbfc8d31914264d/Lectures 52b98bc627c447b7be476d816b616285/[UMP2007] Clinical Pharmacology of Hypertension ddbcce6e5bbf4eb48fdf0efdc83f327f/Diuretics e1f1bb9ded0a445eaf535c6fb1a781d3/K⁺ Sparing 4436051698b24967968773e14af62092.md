Examples: Spironolactone                   Eplerenone                             Amiloride
Notes: May cause Hyperkalaemia as they do not lead to increased K⁺ Secretion due to increase Na⁺ Delivery to the CCD
Site of Action: Spironolactone/Eplerenone = Aldosterone Antagonists            Amiloride = ENaC Blocker
