# Depression

- Affective disorder - Disorder of mood rather than thought or cognition.
- Always involves sustained low mood and a loss of interest in the environment, with additional Sx that may be present
- Lifetime prevalence of about 25%.
- Primary mental disorder by 2030.
- About 20% attempt suicide.
- About 5-10% succeed at suicide.
- Only 30% respond to 1st line of treatment.
- About 30% are non-responders to any drugs (especially psychotic depression).
- Failure to respond ‚Üë with each episode
- Most effective Rx combines Pharmacological Interventions with Behavioural Therapy

### Symptoms and Signs of Depression

**Psychological/Emotional** 

- Depressed mood, misery, pessimism Anhedonia
- Low self-esteem, guilt, inadequacy
- Poor concentration
- Indecisiveness and lack of motivation
- Feeling of hopelessness and helplessness
- Suicidal thoughts
- Hypochondria

**Somatic/Biological/Psychomotor**

- Retardation of thought and action (cognitive deficits)
- Fatigue
- Loss of appetite (unintentional weight change) and sleep disturbance
- Aches and pains
- Loss of libido

**Behavioural**

- Psychomotor Agitation or Retardation
- Self-Neglect

---

# Types of Depressive Syndromes

### Mood Spectrum

- Major Depressive Disorder and Mania are considered to be at opposite ends of the Affective/Mood Disorder Spectrum

### Unipolar Depression/MDD

- Reactive, non-familial: association with stressful life events/anxiety/agitation (75%).
- Endogenous (familial pattern): distinct symptomatology unrelated to stress (25%).
- This is characterised by depressed mood and inhibited psychomotor drive.
- Thymoleptics: drugs with pronounced property of re-elevating mood (e.g. TCAs affect monoamine reuptake).
- Thymeretics: drugs that predominantly activate psychomotor drive (e.g. MAOIs affect monoamine metabolism).
- Effective therapeutics should be both a thymoleptic and thymeretic property.
- A drug that only enhances psychomotor drive in absence of mood elevation (e.g. amphetamine) ‚Üë suicide risk

### Bipolar Depression

- Depression alternating with mania over periods of weeks.
- Requires at least 2 weeks of mood change and 1 week of mania.
- Mania component: excessive exuberance/enthusiasm/self-confidence coupled with impulsivity and occasionally combined with irritability/impatience/aggression and grandiose delusion.
- Extreme cases have psychotic symptoms.
- Early adult presence, strong hereditary tendency.

---

# Monoamine Hypothesis of Depression

**Is Depression a Deficit of Monoamine Transmission?**

- Reserpine depletes monoamines via VMAT2 Inhibition: caused depression in 15% of patients.

**Do Antidepressants augment Monoamine Transmission?**

- Iproniazid prevents monoamine metabolism: caused euphoria in patients.
- Studies have shown that there is no difference in [Monoamine] or their metabolites in Px with Depression and Non-Depressed Px

### Hypothesis of Antidepression

- Augmentation of NA: NA transmission.
- Augmentation of serotonin (5HT): serotonergic transmission.

---

# Noradrenergic Neurons

- VMAT transports NA into Vesicles
- NET (norepinephrine transporter) is responsible for reuptake of extracellular NA to terminate Noradrenergic Signalling.
- Within the Nerve Terminal, NA is broken down by MAO-Monoamine Oxidase within Mitochondria
- In 5-HT Nerve Terminals, Reuptake is mediated by SERT and Metabolism is mediated by MAO
- Via Inhibition of NET/SERT or MAO, This prevent Reuptake and Metabolism of NA/5-HT Respectively, causing Synaptic [NA/5-HT] and hence, Noradrenergic Signalling to increase
- Presynaptic ùõº2 adrenoceptor ‚Üí ùê∫ùëñ/ùëú signalling ‚Üí inhibit neurotransmitter (NA - Autoreceptor and 5-HT - Heteroreceptors) release.
- Presynaptic 5HT1A receptor ‚Üí Gi/o Signalling ‚Üí Inhibition Neurotransmitter (NA - Heteroreceptors and 5-HT - Autoreceptors) release.
- Therefore, ùõº2 and 5HT-1A Antagonists can reduce Inhibition of NA and 5-HT Signalling to increase Synaptic [NA/5-HT] to Rx Depression

# MAOa Inhibition

### In Nerve Terminals

- Associated with mitochondria.
- In nerve terminals, controls concentration of monoamines (dopamine, NA and serotonin).
- Discovered through use of anti tuberculotic drug iproniazid, which cause euphoria in patients.

### Effect

- Inhibition of MAO-A ‚Üë cytoplasmic [5HT] and [NA].
- This causes the efflux of neurotransmitter via Reverse Transport across the reuptake transporter (not exocytotic release).
- This increases Synaptic [5HT] and [NA].
- Antidepressant effect especially for agitated depression (depression with anxiety)

### Drugs

- MAO-A Substrates = NA and 5-HT
- Non-Selective Substrates = Tyramine and DA
- MOA-B Substrate = Benzylamine and  ùú∑-phenylethylamine
- Selective Inhibition of MAO-B does not produce Anti-Depressant effects whilst Selective Inhibition of MAO-A does

### Inhibitors

| Inhibitors | MAO-A | Non-Selective | MAO-B |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Irreversible | Clorgyline | Iproniazid Isocarboxazid Phenelzine Tranylcypromine  | 1) Deprenyl/Segillne                      2) Pargyline |
| Reversible Inhibitors of Monoamine Oxidase (RIMA) | Moclobemide Brofaromide Pirlinidole Toloxatone Befloxtone |  |  |

# MAO-A Inhibition in Intestinal Mucosa and Liver and Reuptake Inhibitors

- MAO-A is also expressed in the mucosa and liver metabolises dietary amines to prevent passage into systemic circulation.

### Effect of Inhibition

- Inhibition of intestinal/liver MAOA ‚Üí ‚Üë in systemic/plasma tyramine ‚Üí displacement of endogenous NA from Vesicles in sympathetic nerve endings (Indirectly Acting Sympatheticomimetic):
1. Major stimulation of ùõº1 adrenoceptors on vasculature ‚Üí hypertension.
2. Major stimulation of ùõΩ1 adrenoceptors on heart ‚Üí tachycardia.
- This is known as the Cheese Reaction
- Acute NMDA/Ecstasy toxicity associated with SERT Inhibition is equivalent to this
- Potentiation of sympathomimetics (e.g. ephedrine, phenylephrine)
- Overdose with MAO-A Inhibitors ‚Üí Fatal Respiratory Depression, especially with Alcohol and Barbiturates
- Postural hypotension
- ‚Üë motor activity and excitability.
- Because of these effects, patients need to carry a treatment card
- They are not First Line Rx for Antidepressants, especially Irrversible Inhibitions due to their long lasting effects and hence, long lasting side effects

### Inhibitors of 5-HT and NA Transport (Reuptake Inhibitor)

- It is unknown whether DAT Inhibition produces Antidepressive Effects

| Monoamine | Target |
| --- | --- |
| 5-HT | SERT (Serotonin Transporter) |
| NA | NET (Noradrenaline Transporter) |
| DA | DAT (Dopamine Transporter) |

---

# Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)

- Structurally similar to antipsychotic phenothiazines.
- Block reuptake, mainly of NA

| Monoamine | Drug |
| --- | --- |
| 5-HT | Imipramine, Amitriptyline, Clomipramine (Tertiary Amines) |
| NA | Desipramine (Secondary Amine) |
- Imipramine is biotransformed (demethylated) to form desmethylimipramine which affects NA Reuptake and hence, Imipramine may be producing its clinical effects via NET Inhibition.
- [Dopamine] via DAT Inhibition is less affected by TCAs.

### Problems and Adverse Effects

- Antidepressants generally take 2-3 weeks (Long Time) to have an effect.
- Acutely, TCAs cause sedation, confusion, motor incoordination (effects desensitise and disappear overtime and are not associated with Antidepressant effects).
- Lack of selectivity:
1. ùú∂ùüè adrenoceptor antagonist: postural hypotension.
2. H1 receptor antagonism: sedation. H1 receptor involved in sleep.
3. Muscarinic (mAChR) receptor antagonism: dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation (Autonomic Effects).
4. Acute cardiotoxicity: at higher doses.
5. Overdose and drug interactions (e.g. alcohol): life threatening.

# 5-HT and NA Reuptake Inhibitors

### Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)

- Selectively inhibit SERT
- These have become First Line drugs for the Rx of Depression with TCAs mainly being localised to the Rx of Neuropathic Pain

| Drug | Info |
| --- | --- |
| Zimelidine | First SSRI |
| Fluoxetine | Most popular in 1990s, probably not an SSRI as it appears to be non-selective |
| Citalopram | Most Selective for SERT (Specifically the Escitalopram Isomer) |
| Paroxetine | Most Potent for SERT - Used more predominantly as a Sedative but produce Akathesia and GI Effects |
| Vortioxetine | Newest SSRI |
| Fluvoxamine |  |
| Sertraline |  |

### Problems and Adverse Effects

- Gastro-intestinal: 5HT neurones in gut.
- Rash/tremor/urticaria (hives).
- Loss of libido.
- Safer in overdose.
- Due to their Selectivity, they do not produce Œ±1 Orthostatic Hypotension, H1 Sedation, mAChR Autonomic Effects or Acute Cardiotoxicity

### Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) - 3rd Generation Antidepressant

- Maprotiline - Tetracyclic NRI Selectively inhibits NET
- They are still have a similar side effect profile as TCAs

### Serotonin and Noradrenaline Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) - 3rd Generation Antidepressant

- E.g Venlafaxine
- Inhibits both SERT (serotonin transporter) and NET (No Activity at DAT).
- Low therapeutic dose: Inhibition of SERT > Inhbition of NET.
- High therapeutic dose: Inhibition of SERT = Inhibition of NET.
- In the Body, Venlafaxine can be converted to Desvenlafaxine, which produces stronger inhibition of NET than SERT

---

# Mixed Actions

### Mirtazapine

- (like maprotiline): another tetracyclic.
1. NA reuptake inhibitory (NRI) activity to increase Synaptic [NA].
2. ùõº2 adrenoceptor antagonist ‚Üí ‚Üì presynaptic feedback inhibition of NA and 5HT release to further increase Synaptic [NA].
- No ùõº1 adrenoceptor/mAChR antagonism (No Postural Hypotension).
- Sedative (H1 receptor antagonism) is still seen as a side effect
- It has non-selective effects on Postsynaptic 5HT2A/5HT3 receptor antagonist activity ‚Üí ‚Üì non-selective serotonergic stimulation (insomnia, agitation, sexual dysfunction, nausea).

### Mianserin

- (like maprotiline): another tetracyclic.
- Not an MAO inhibitor.
1. Has weak monoamine (NA) uptake inhibitory activity.
2. Strong ùõº2 adrenoceptor antagonist: ‚Üì presynaptic feedback inhibition of NA release.
3. 5HT1D/5HT2A/5HT2C/5HT3 receptor inverse agonist/antagonist activity: ‚Üì presynaptic feedback inhibition of 5-HT release and reduces postsynaptic side effects seen with Mirtazipine

### Trazodone

- Serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI).
- Does nothing for monoamine transmission, which conflicts with monoamine hypothesis.
1. Serotonin reuptake inhibitory (SSRI) activity.
2. 5HT2 adrenoceptor antagonist - Reduces Postsynaptic Serotonergic Side Effects.
- No mAChR antagonism (No Autonomic Effects).
- Sedative H1 receptor antagonism.
- Orthostatic hypotension, ùõº1 adrenoceptor antagonism

### Atypical Antidepressants

- Iprindole - No effect on Monoaminergic Reuptake or Presynaptic Receptors (Therefore, other neurotransmitters must also be involved in Depression)

---

# Drugs Targeting Intracellular Messengers and Electroconvulsive Therapy

### Drugs Targeting Intracellular Messengers

- Rolipram: Phosphodiesterase inhibitor
- Type IV PDE ‚Üí ‚Üë cAMP/PKA ‚Üí ‚Üë synthesis and release of NA.
- Numerous side effects due to increasing cAMP/PKA which have multiple roles beyond NA Synthesis.

### Electroconvulsive Therapy

- Severely depressed, suicidal or manic patients non-responsive to medication.
- ‚Üë CNS sensitivity to NA and 5-HT to indirectly increase NA and 5-HT Signalling

---

# Ongoing Debate

### Support of Monoamine Theory of Depression

| Drug | Action | Effect on Mood |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reserpine | Inhibition of NA and 5-HT Storage | Reduced |
| ùú∂-methyldopa | Inhibition of NA Synthesis | Reduced |
| MAOIs | Increase in [NA] and [5-HT] in Cytoplasm and Stimulus-Independent Release (Reverse Transport) | Increased |
| TCAs/SSRIs/NRIs/SNRIs | Inhibition of NA and 5-HT Reuptake ‚Üí Increases [NA] and [5-HT] in the Synaptic Cleft | Increased |

### But what about?

- Amphetamine: affects NA levels.
- Cocaine: inhibits NA, 5HT and DA uptake. Not an anti-depressant.
- Therapeutic lag: an inhibitor of a reuptake mechanism has an immediate effect. Yet, it still takes time for antidepressants to work

### Arguments Counter to the Monoamine Theory of Depression

| Evidence | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Amphetamine, cocaine, L-DOPA | Increased NA Transmission, but anti-depressant actions are debatable/absent |
| Delayed therapeutic action of all drugs in Depression despite rapid Pharmacological effects | Suggests change in Receptor numbers, possibly in multiple systems |
| Not all anti-depressant drugs enhance monoaminergic
transmission | E.g Iprindole is a Tricyclic but it has no effect on NA and 5-HT Turnover |
| Levels of NA and 5HT and
metabolites thereof, in CSF, and urine respectively appear unchanged between Depressed and Non-Depressed Px |  |
| Biochemical changes associated with depression often similar to those associated with mania, despite being on opposite ends of the Affective Disorder Spectrum |  |

# 5-HT Neurons and Lag Period

- 5HT1A receptors are inhibitory and expressed on the Soma and Nerve Terminal

**Short Term**

- SSRI‚Üí Increased extra-neuronal [5-HT] and reduced Intra-neuronal [5-HT] ‚Üí Activation of 5-HT1A R at the Soma‚Üí Decreased firing of Serotonergic Neurons
- Activation of Presynaptic 5-HT1A R at the Nerve Terminal ‚Üí Increased [5-HT] in the Synaptic Cleft ‚Üí Increased Stimulation of Postsynaptic 5-HT Receptors
- Decreased Firing of 5-HT Neurons and Increased Postsynaptic Stimulation of 5-HT-Rs seem to cancel each other out, producing no Antidepressive Effects

**Long Term Effects**

- SSRI‚Üí Increased extraneuronal [5HT] ‚Üí Increased 5-HT Signalling/Stimulation ‚Üí 5HT1A Rs expressed on the Soma desensitized ‚Üí no feedback inhibition of NT release (Reduced Inhibition of 5-HT Neurons) ‚Üí increased firing ‚Üí Increase Synaptic [5-HT] ‚Üí Antidepressive Effects
- Activation of Presynaptic 5-HT1A R at the Nerve Terminal ‚Üí Increased [5-HT] in the Synaptic Cleft ‚Üí Increased Stimulation of Postsynaptic 5-HT Receptors
- Therefore, Effects of Increased Firing and Increased Postsynaptic 5-HT Receptor Stimulation summate to produce Antidepressive effects
- This may explain the Lag Phase seen in the Effects of Antidepressives

![Screenshot 2022-01-12 at 19.12.14.png](%5BUMP2024%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20Depression%20and%20%20f7dc95c95d9d414f8fff3d932cdfbaa4/Screenshot_2022-01-12_at_19.12.14.png)

### Other Hypothesis for the Lag Period

- Hippocampal neurogenesis - Increased Hippocampal Activity/Signalling may improve Cognition and Reduce Sx in Affective Disorders
- Synaptogenesis/remodelling
- Oscillatory synchrony - Needs time to Synchronise various 5-HT Neurons so that their activity can be summated to produce Antidepressive Effects

# Bipolar Depression

- SSRI contraindicated for Bipolar I as if used in the Depression Phase, they might cause a switch to mania.
- Antidepressants alone in bipolar II ‚Üë suicide ideation and risk.
- Lithium is used prophylactically, because it ‚Üì mood switching. > 2 mMol is extremely toxic.

### Bipolar I - Mania

- Manic episodes with psychotic
element requiring hospitalisation, cycling with major depression
- Mood Stabilisers = Lithium (1-2 mMol - High [ ]) (used prophylactically to prevent switching)
1. Lithium/Li‚Å∫ enters cells via Voltage Gated Na‚Å∫ Channels
2. ‚Üì phosphatidyl Inositol (PI) turnover
3. ‚Üì GPCR activity (Notably Gs/cAMP)
4. Other mechanisms
- Others and Adjuncts =
1. Anticonvulsants (Lamotrigine, Carbamazepine, Valproate)
2. Antipsychotics with Severe Mania (Quetiapine, Olanzapine, Risperidone)

### Bipolar II - Hypomania

- Hypomaniac episodes (not ever psychotic), chronic cycling between manic and depressive episodes
- Mood Stabilisers = Lithium and Anticonvulsants like Iamotrigine and Barbamazepine
- Others and Adjuncts = Antidepressants (E.g SSRIs) but never alone

---

# Ketamine

- Dissociative anaesthetic (off label antidepressant).
- Acute and rapid (no lag) effect in trials with major depressive disorder (drug/treatment resistant cases).
- Blocks NMDA receptor activation.
- Enhances AMPA receptor activation.
- Disinhibits glutamate release (inhibition of NMDA Receptors on GABA neurones that project to Glutamatergic Interneurons).
- Activation of proteins translation.
- Upregulation of BDNF pathway stimulates Neurogenesis
