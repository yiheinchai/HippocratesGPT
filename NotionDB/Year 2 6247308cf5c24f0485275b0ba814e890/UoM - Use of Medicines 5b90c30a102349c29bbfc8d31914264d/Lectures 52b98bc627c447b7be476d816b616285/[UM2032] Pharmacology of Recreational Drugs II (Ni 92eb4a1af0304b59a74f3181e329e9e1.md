# [UM2032] Pharmacology of Recreational Drugs II (Nicotine and Opioids)

# Drugs of Misuse

- Legal substances (for those ‚â• 18) causing dependence:
1. Alcohol
2. Nicotine
- Examples of other misused drugs:
1. Opioid analgesics: heroin, morphine.
2. Psychomotor stimulants: cocaine, amphetamine.
3. CNS depressants: alcohol, barbiturates.
4. Anxiolytics: benzodiazepines.
5. Hallucinogens: LSD, mescaline.

| Drug Class | Examples | Dependence Liability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opioid Analgesics | Heroin and Morphine  | Very Strong |
| Psychomotor Stimulants | Nicotine, Cocaine and Amphetamines | Very Strong, Very Strong and Strong |
| CNS Depressants | Alcohol and Barbiturates | Strong |
| Anxiolytics | Benzodiazepines | Moderate |
| Hallucinogens | LSD and Mescaline | Weak/Asent |
- Drugs with rapid acute effects are more associated with dependence

# Drug Dependence

- Situation in which drug use becomes compulsive (motivation to take drug is stronger than motivation to stop).
- Situation where individuals have lost control of their drug taking behaviour.
- Repeated drug taking can cause adaptive changes in brain which can result in abstinence syndrome where drug withheld.
- Physical dependence: adaptive state involving physical disturbance when drug is withdrawn (withdrawal or abstinence syndrome).
- This is a ‚Äìve reinforce of drug use (drug intake is maintained so as to prevent effects of withdrawal).
- Psychological dependence: due to effects on mood and behaviour.
- This is a +ve reinforce of drug use (drug intake is maintained because it is rewarding).

### Factors Influencing Dependence

- Pharmacokinetics
1. Rate of onset: drugs that reach CNS rapidly (E.g Inhaled or Injected) are most reinforcing.
2. Rate of elimination: withdrawal syndrome and risk of dependence is most severe for drugs that are eliminated rapidly.
3. Dose: dependence liability ‚Üë with level of intoxication.
4. Duration of action: dependence is determined partly by period for which drug is active in brain.
- Genetic factors: no evidence of a ‚Äòsingle gene for dependence‚Äô, but drug misuse can be influenced by genetic variations (polymorphisms) e.g. in enzymes that metabolise drugs.
- Environment: strong evidence that environmental cues can promote drug-seeking behaviour.

# Dopamine Reward Pathway

- Dopamine-releasing cells in ventral tegmental area (top of brainstem) relay messages to nerve cells in nucleus accumbens.
- These nerve cells relay messages to frontal region of cerebral cortex.

---

# Opium

- Extract of poppy plant Papver somniferum.
- Main pharmacologically active component is morphine.
- They are widely used as Analgesics

### Opioids

- Heroin: (diamorphine) and fentanyl are potent synthetic opioids which are more commonly used as recreational drugs.
- The lethal dose of Fentanyl is significantly lower than that of Heroin (due to fentanyl‚Äôs potency) and hence, Deaths associated with Fentanyl overdoses are increasing, notably where Heroin becomes mixed with Fentayl without the Person taking the Heroin knowing

### Opioid Receptors

- Opioids act as agonists on GPCR (opioid receptors) that are receptors for endogenous opioid such as endorphins and enkephalins, often produced in response to Pain.

### Opioids and Reward Pathway

- Opiates also stimulate Opioid Receptors on GABAergic Interneurons to disinhibit DAergic Neurons involved in the Mesocortical Pathway, producing Reward

### Opioid Dependence

- Heroin: fast-acting opioid receptor agonist, often injected.
- Methadone: slow-acting opioid receptor agonist, taken orally.
- UK Prescriptions of opioids have increased by 60% between 2008 and 2018 (14 ‚Üí 23 million)
- There is evidence of increasing addiction to prescription opioids
- Recently (April 2019), the UK Government announced that all opioid pain killers would be required to cary prominent warnings about risks of addiction

### Acute and Withdrawal Effects of Heroin

| Acute Effects | Withdrawal Effects |
| --- | --- |
| Pain Relief | Muscle Aches |
| Reduced Anxiety | Anxiety |
| Reduced Reflexes | Agitation |
| Reduced Temperature | Fever |
| Constipation | Diarrhoea |
| Anti-Tussive | Coughing |
| Reduced Secretions | Tears/Runny Nose |
- Tolerance to acute effects develops with regular use

### Drugs used in Treatment of Opioid Dependence and Withdrawal

- Methadone: slow-acting opioid receptor agonist ‚Üí Ease withdrawal Sx and cravings associated with Heroin withdrawal and has a Lower dependence liability than Heroin due to its slow onset.
- Buprenorphine: opioid receptor partial agonist ‚Üí Ease withdrawal Sx and cravings associated with Opioid Withdrawal by providing low level stimulation of Opioid Receptors.
- Naltrexone: opioid receptor antagonist ‚Üí Used to prevent effects of Opioids to prevent Positive Reinforcement and hence addiction/dependence. It also ensures that if a Px relapses, Opioids will be less effective and hence, less likely to stimulate reward and addiction

# Nicotine

- Tobacco smoke contains 4,000 different chemicals, but it is nicotine in tobacco that is responsible for its addictive properties and important pharmacological effects.

### Tobacco Smoking

- Tobacco has been smoked for at least 2,000 years.
- First introduced into UK in 16th Century by Sir Walter Raleigh.
- Thomas Harriot (1560-1621), who sailed with Raleigh to New World, was one of those who helped to popularise tobacco
smoking in this country, often by encouraging its positive/beneficial effects and due to addictive effects of Nicotine.

### UK Tobacco Advertising and Policy

- TV advertising of cigarettes was banned in UK in 1965.
- Press and poster advertising was banned in UK in 2003.
- Smoking in public places banned in 2007 (2006 in Scotland).
- Became illegal to sell tobacco products to under 18s in 2007.

### Cigarette Smoking and Disease

- Conclusions of a 50-year epidemiological study:
- Individuals who continue to smoke cigarettes die on average 10 years younger than lifelong non-smokers.
- Cessation at age of 50 halves risk of premature death.
- Cessation at 30 almost removes ‚Üë risk.

### Tobacco Smoking in UK

- About 10 million adults in UK smoke cigarettes.
- Approximately 75 billion cigarettes are consumed each year in UK
- Estimated that 120,000 deaths/year in UK are due to tobacco smoking.
- Tobacco smoking is estimated to cost NHS ¬£1.5 billion/year.

# Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics of Nicotine

- Inhaled nicotine is absorbed into bloodstream via lungs and rapidly distributed throughout body, reaching brain within 10 seconds.
- This causes a rapid peak and then decline in [Nicotine] in the Blood, causing it to have short lasting, potent action that encourages addiction
- Transdermal patches, that slowly release Nicotine into the blood, is less likely to cause addiction than inhaled nicotine
- Acute effects of nicotine dissipate within a few minutes.

### nAChRs

- Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing ùõº4 and ùõΩ2 subunits have been implicated in mediating addictive effects of nicotine.
- Self-administration of nicotine is attenuated in mice containing deletion of gene encoding nAChR ùõΩ2 subunit, indicating that nAChRs expressing ùõº4 and ùõΩ2 subunits are involved in Reward and Addiction associated with nicotine
- Skeletal neuromuscular junction: muscle nAChRs (postsynaptic).
- Central and peripheral nervous system: neuronal nAChRs (presynaptic and postsynaptic).
- Presynaptic nAChRs are notably permeable to Ca¬≤‚Å∫ and hence, can mediate neurotransmitter release

### Neurotransmitter Release

- Nicotine (acting on nAChRs) stimulates release of several neurotransmitters including:
1. Dopamine: psychoactive effects.
2. Noradrenaline (notably from the Adrenal Medulla): ‚Üë attentiveness.
3. GABA and endorphins: anxiolytic effects.

### Psychoactive Effects

- Nicotine activates nicotinic receptors in brain causing release of dopamine in mesolimbic dopamine pathway.

# Physiological Effects of Nicotine

### ANS

- Mixture of sympathetic and parasympathetic effects.
1. ‚Üë heart rate.
2. ‚Üë blood pressure.
3. ‚Üë sweating
4. ‚Üì gastrointestinal motility.
5. Release of adrenaline and noradrenalin from adrenal medulla.

### CNS

- Stimulatory and inhibitory effects.
- Symptoms of stimulation and arousal.
- Can also alleviate stress and anxiety.
- May enhance learning and sensory performance but this is likely to be due to increased attention.

### Relaxation of Skeletal Muscle

- Due to activation of nAChRs in spinal cord, rather than direct effect at neuromuscular junction as Nicotine is a weak agonist at muscle nAChRs.

---

# Tolerance and Withdrawal

- Tolerance: higher doses required to produce same effect.
- Physical withdrawal symptoms (days-weeks);
1. Irritability
2. Restlessness
3. Attentional deficits
4. Sleep disturbances
5. Hunger
- Craving: can persist for much longer than withdrawal Sx.

### Electronic Cigarettes

- E-cigarettes contain an atomiser that is used to heat a solution of nicotine to create an aerosol or vapour that is inhaled.
- Since their introduction in 2006, e cigarettes have ‚Üë in popularity.
- Estimated that 2.8 million adults in Great Britain use e-cigarettes.
- They are deemed to be safer than Cigarettes as whilst delivering Nicotine to stimulate reward and prevent withdrawal/cravings, it does not deliver other associated carcinogens that are found in cigarettes
- There are concerns that E-Cigarettes are more used by individuals who have never previously smoked before Vs being used as a smoking cessation aid/safer alternative to cigarettes

### Smoking Cessation

- Many smokers say they would like to stop.
- 50% who stop for 6 weeks relapse by 6 months.
- 20% who stops for 6 months relapse by 1 year.

### Health Warnings

- Larger and more prominent health warnings on UK Cigarette packages were introduced in 2003
- In 2012, Australian government introduced major changes concerning health warnings and use brand names on cigarette packets.
- Similar style packaging is now being introduced in UK.

### Drugs Used to Treat Nicotine Dependence and Withdrawal

- Nicotine: as used in nicotine replacement therapy to relieve withdrawal symptoms.
- This is often in slow-release forms like Patches, Gum and Inhalers that relieve withdrawal Sx
- They deliver a lower level of nicotine than obtained from tobacco smoking.
- They also avoid carcinogens present in tobacco smoke and hence, are deemed to be safer.
- Varenicline: Partial agonist of Œ±4Œ≤2 nAChRs causes a moderate and sustained increase in Mesolimbic DA Levels to minimise withdrawal Sx and Craving.
- As a partial agonist (with lower potency than Nicotine), it acts as a competitive antagonist when Nicotine is present, reducing the rewarding properties of Nicotine during a relapse
- Bupropion: drug originally used to treat depression.
- Mode of action in smoking cessation is unclear.
- May involve effects on dopamine and noradrenaline transmission to prevent low mood/depression that occurs following smoking cessation.
- NICE Concluded in 2002 that Nicotine Replacement Therapy and Buproprion are amongst the most cost-effective healthcare Rx due to the sheer cost of Rx Tobacco related diseases, despite significant relapse associated with Attempts of Nicotine Withdrawal

# Drugs and Reward Pathway

- Recreational Drugs have varying Dependence Liability, established by their Pharmacokinetics, but usually establish dependence via their activity on the Mesocortical DA System
