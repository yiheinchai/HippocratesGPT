# Atherosclerosis

- Deposition of plaques containing cholesterol and lipids on innermost layer of wall of large and medium-sized arteries.

### Healthy Arteries

- Arterial Endothelium has many roles such as:
1. Maintenance of Vascular Tone to control BP
2. Regulate Substance exchange between Blood and Tissues
3. Control of Cell Adhesiveness and Leukocyte Migration
4. Control of Coagulation
- This is achieved by the release of Signalling Molecules like NO and Prostacyclin (Vasodilator and Anti-Adhesive)

### Pathophysiology of Atherosclerosis

- Atherosclerosis only occurs in arteries as BP in veins is too low.
- There is a positive correlation between Serum [LDL] and risk of CVD, whilst there is a negative correlation between [HDL] and Risk of CVD

# Lipids

- Cholesterol: sterol made in liver but can be absorbed from the diet. It is used to synthesise Steroid Hormones, Fat Soluble Vitamins like Vitamin D, Cell Wall components and Bile Acid
- Fatty acids: hydrophobic carboxylic acids with long carbon chains. 2 main types (saturated or unsaturated). They are the main source of ATP in metabolically active organs like the Heart and Kidneys but not the Brain (It can only metabolise glucose).
- Triglyceride (TAG): 3 FAs + Glyceron. They are involved in storage of fat and how it is transported.

### Transportation of Lipids

- To allow for transport in the circulation, Hydrophobic FAs are attached to Apolipoproteins, to form Lipoprotein Complexes
- They have a core of Hydrophobic FAs and a Periphery of Apolipoproteins, Glycoproteins and Free Cholesterol
- Apolipoproteins act as ligands for receptors and enzymes
- Chylomicrons: transport cholesterol and TAGs from GI tract to muscle and adipose tissue.
- TAGs release at end-organ (via lipoprotein lipase) and chylomicron remnants transport cholesterol to liver (stored, bile acids, VLDL → circulation).
- VLDL (very low-density lipoproteins): newly synthesised TAGs and cholesterol are released from the liver and transported as VLDL.
- As TAGs are released, their density increases so they become IDL and then LDL (low-density lipoproteins).
- LDLs (Predominantly Cholesterol) take cholesterol to peripheral tissues, where it is released by the activity of LDL-receptor but it deposits on walls of blood vessels over time, building up into cholesterol plaque and blocks
blood vessels, especially coronary arteries.
- Around 80% of Cholesterol in the Circulation is synthesised as VLDL that becomes LDL Vs dietary derived
- HDL (high-density lipoproteins): collect cholesterol particles as they travel through blood vessels and deposits them in liver where they are transferred to bile acids and disposed of (and to
steroidogenic organs, such as ovaries and testes).
- Chylomicron → VLDL → IDL → HDL. Density and [Cholesterol] Increases whilst [TAG] Decreases

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 12.12.59.png](%5BUMP2029%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Lipid-Lowering%20Drugs%207b437ad734a9438ca4687e5bc14f708d/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_12.12.59.png)

1. Dietary TAGs are broken down into FAs by Lipases and Bile to be reform within Enterocytes
2. TAGs are then packaged with Cholesterol and Apolipoproteins to form Chylomicrons that are released into the circulation
3. LPL (with ApoCII as a cofactor), expressed on Peripheral Tissue, releases FFAs from Chylomicrons 
4. Chylomicron remnants are delivered to and broken down in the Liver, with their contents reused to make further Lipoproteins

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 12.13.09.png](%5BUMP2029%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Lipid-Lowering%20Drugs%207b437ad734a9438ca4687e5bc14f708d/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_12.13.09.png)

1. Liver synthesised VLDL to transport endogenous fats
2. TAGs are removed from VLDL by LPL, causing TAG Content of the Chylomicron to decrease
3. VLDL → IDL → LDL (LDL is when Cholesterol > TAG) via removal of TAGs by LPL Activity
4. ApoB100 binds to LDL-R, allowing LDL Uptake
5. HDL transports cholesterol to the Liver and also to Adrenals, Ovaries and Testes to allow for synthesis of Steroid Hormones

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 12.13.33.png](%5BUMP2029%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Lipid-Lowering%20Drugs%207b437ad734a9438ca4687e5bc14f708d/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_12.13.33.png)

- Various CVD risk factors cause endothelial dysfunction (characterised by reduction of Vasoprotective Mediators like NO) and alongside increased Sheer Stress, this increases Endothelial Permeability and Leukocyte Adhesion.
- Areas with high sheer stress (bifurcation) tend to have more atherosclerosis
1. Oxidised LDL enters the intima stimulates Inflammation when there is Endothelial Dysfunction 
2. Monocytes migrate into the Intima where they differentiate to form Macrophages
3. Monocytes phagocytose Oxidise LDL and become foam cells, die and leave lipid there, which accumulates.
4. Over time, a Fibrous Cap forms over the Lesion to increase its stability to prevent rupturing 
- Hypertension and Systemic Inflammation are also risk factors for Atherosclerosis

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 12.14.06.png](%5BUMP2029%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Lipid-Lowering%20Drugs%207b437ad734a9438ca4687e5bc14f708d/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_12.14.06.png)

- Early Deposits appear as Fatty Streaks and may be seen in young children
- These streaks enlarge and form a fibrous cap, continuing to increase in size to a point where they being to produce Sx
- Sx are usually related to Ischaemia of tissues being supplied by the Affected Vessels (E.g Coronal Vessels → Angina, Legs → Claudication)
- Rupturing of the Fibrous Plaque leads to Clot formation on the Lipid Core, occluding the Vessel and causing significantly downstream Ischaemia

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 12.14.57.png](%5BUMP2029%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Lipid-Lowering%20Drugs%207b437ad734a9438ca4687e5bc14f708d/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_12.14.57.png)

# Atherosclerosis and Cardiovascular Disease

- As Atherosclerosis affects all arterial beds, the Sx that it produces are dependent on the structures supplied by the affected vessel and which tissue becomes ischaemic

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 12.15.42.png](%5BUMP2029%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Lipid-Lowering%20Drugs%207b437ad734a9438ca4687e5bc14f708d/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_12.15.42.png)

# Causes of Hyperlipidaemia

- Primary: no secondary or inherited cause found.
- Secondary: dietary, sedentary lifestyle, excess alcohol, uncontrolled diabetes, hypothyroidism, Cushings’, liver disease,
nephrotic syndrome, medications.
- These are life style factors, diseases and Medications like Atypical Antipsychotics and Corticosteroids
- Inherited: familial (Considered if High Lipid Levels and Strong FHx of CVD, Hyperlipidaemia or other Clinical Manifestations)

### Familial Hyperlipidaemia

- Classically classified according to which lipoprotein is raised (by lipid electrophoresis).
- Called Fredrickson classification. For each type (I-V), there may be more than 1 recognised cause of each type.
- May be classified according to whether cholesterol and TAGs are ↑ in isolation or in combination.

### PCSK9 Mutation

- Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 ↓ hepatic LDL receptors (binds to LDL receptor and then complex is internalised).
- Gain of function mutation identified in several families in 2003.
- ↓ hepatic uptake of LDL, ↑ circulating LDL, causing atherosclerosis → This can give rise to Raised LDL in FH.

| Type | Raised Lipoprotein | Causes | Cholesterol | TAGs | Info |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I (Familial Chylomicronaemia) | Chylomicrons | 1) Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency 2) Apolipoprotein C-II Deficiency (Cofactor for Lipoprotein Lipase) → These both prevent LPL activity on Chylomicrons | No | Raised | It is autosomal Recessive, presents in Childhood and causes Severe Hypertriglyceridaemia, causing Recurrent Pancreatitis and Ruptive Cutaneous Xanthromata on the Skin. It is very rare. Main Rx is Severe Restriction of Dietary Fat Intake (As Chylomicrons transport Exogenous TAGs) |
| IIa (Familial Hypercholesterolaemia) | LDL | Polygenic Hypercholesterolaemia (Lack of LDL-R so LDL remains in Blood)  | Raised | No | One of the most common inherited CVDs. Heterozygous FH have a higher risk of Heart Disease that typically presents in 30s. Homozygotes may develop Heart Disease in Childhood. Sx = Tendon Xanthoma but as this only appears in 30% of Cases, Simon Broome Criteria is used to Dx, allowing for screening and Primary Prevention Measures in Family Members. In most causes, An Autosomal Dominant Monogenic can be found but when this is not present, Polygenic Cause is suspected |
| IIb → Familial Combined Hyperlipidaemia | LDL and VLDL | Thought to be polygenic, that manifests due to Lifestyle Factors | Raised | Raised | Characterised by overproduction of VLDL and ApoB and often causes premature Atherosclerosis. Familial Combined Hyperlipidaemia (Type IIb) is much more common than Dysbetalipoproteinaemia despite the same lipid profile |
| III → Dysbetalipoproteinaemia/Remnant Removal Disease | IDL |  | Raised | Raised | Some IDL can be directly removed by the Liver without being converted to LDL first. Defects in this cause raised IDL, causing Raised Cholesterol and TAG. ApoE is the Ligand on IDL for its Hepatic Receptor. There are 3 main ApoE Isoforms, with ApoE2:ApoE2 having a small chance of developing Dysbetalipoproteinaemia. Sx = Accelerated Atherosclerosis, Xanthoma Striatum Palmare (Yellow Palms) and Tuberoeruptive Xanthoma over Elbows and Knees |
| IV → Familial Hypertriglyceridaemia (Tends to present with Diabetes) | VLDL | Polygenic | No | Raised | Associated with Obesity and Hyperglycaemia and usually presents in Early Adulthood. It is associated with Premature Atherosclerosis as it is also associated with Diabetes and presents later in life. Despite a similar lipid profile, it is significantly more common than Type I FH |

# Lipid Lowering Drugs

- Very little evidence that there is a relationship between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol as the majority of circulating cholesterol is derived from Hepatic Synthesis vs Diet.
- Higher Dietary Cholesterol inhibits Hepatic Cholesterol Synthesis in a negative feedback loop and also increased HDL Levels alongside LDL, maintaining HDL:LDL
- Diets should be lower in (most) saturated fatty acids and especially trans-fatty acids (as these tend to contribute towards Insulin Insensitivity, Systemic Inflammation and Endothelial Dysfunction), and higher in unsaturated fat (especially poly-unsaturated).

---

# Who to Treat and Targets

### Who to Treat?

- Primary prevention: those at high-risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
1. Familial hyperlipidaemias
2. Diabetes
3. Chronic kidney disease
4. 10-year cardiovascular risk > 10% (e.g. QRISK3): This consider things such as lipid levels, BP, BMI, age, smoking status.
- Secondary prevention: statins should be offered to all those with established cardiovascular risk due to previous Cardiovascular Disease including MI, angina, PVD, non-haemorrhagic stroke and TIAs, irregardless of Lipid Levels.

### Targets (NICE - 2014)

- Primary Prevention - Measure total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol in all people who have been started on high-intensity statin treatment at 3 months of treatment and aim for a greater than 40% ↓ in non-HDL cholesterol.
- Secondary Prevention - 40% reduction in Non-LDL Cholesterol with a target non-HDL < 2.5 mmol/L (Equivalent to LDL < 1.8 mmol/L)
- There has been no level of LDL below which benefit ceases or harm occurs identified (The Lower the LDL, the better)
- Therefore, extremely low LDL levels have been recommended for Very High Risk Px to reduce their risk of future CV Events
- Benefits are related to LDL Lowering rather than to a specific drug (E.g Statin)

# Treatments

- Life-style modification.
- Statins
- Ezetimibe
- Fibrates
- Bile acid sequestrants
- Nicotinic acid
- Omega 3 fatty acids
- Lomitapide
- Bile Acid Sequestrants, Nicotinic Acid and Omega 3 FAs are not recommended for the prevention of CVD (Either alone or in combination with a statin)
- Statins are the most effective and commonly prescribed Lipid Lowering Drugs
- Ezetimide, Fibrates and PCSK9i are also used

---

# Statins

- Competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy 3methylglutary coenzyme A (HMG
CoA) reductase (enzyme which catalyses rate-limiting step in
cholesterol synthesis).
- This Reduces Hepatocyte VLDL Synthesis and Upregulates LDL-R Expression to remove LDL from the Circulation
- Example: Simvastatin or Atorvastatin (Most commonly prescribed in Secondary Prevention)
- High Intensity Statins decrease LDL Levels by >40% (E.g Atorvastatin), commonly prescribed at 80mg, when it is most potent
- High Dose (80mg) Simvastatin is not recommended as it has a high incidence of Side Effects at this dose

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 12.22.23.png](%5BUMP2029%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Lipid-Lowering%20Drugs%207b437ad734a9438ca4687e5bc14f708d/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_12.22.23.png)

### Uses and Side Effects

**First Drug of Choice in Primary and Secondary Prevention of CVD:**

- Some statins (with a short half-life like Fluvastatin and Simvastatin) should be taken at night as Hepatic Cholesterol Synthesis mostly occurs at Night (When Px is in Fasting State)
- Atorvastatin does not have to be taken specifically at night due to its longer half life

### Side Effects

1. Muscle effects: myopathy, myositis and rhabdomyolysis.
- These are rare, but more likely at higher doses and in high-risk patients (renal impairment, high alcohol intake, elderly).
1. Rare: hepatitis, jaundice.
2. Very rare: hepatic failure, interstitial lung disease, pancreatic, lupus-like reactions.
- These side effects are rare and hence, drugs are very well tolerated, with the predominant Sx Burden from Side Effects being due to the Nocebo effect (Negative Effects from Placebo)

---

# Ezetimibe

- Inhibits intestinal absorption of cholesterol (Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein) (but this is not main source of cholesterol).
- 2nd most commonly prescribed cholesterol lowering drug
- Used along has a modest effect on LDL levels.
- Used mainly as an adjunct to statin therapy to ↓ LDL levels (can be used instead of statins if statin not tolerated).
- No trial evidence that the use of Ezetimibe alongside Statins ↓ CV deaths beyond that achieved with statins alone.

---

# Fibrates

- Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPARs) agonists.
1. ↑ fatty acid oxidation in muscle and liver.
2. Activation of lipoprotein lipase.
- This means they ↓ serum triglycerides (more effective than statins).
- Used mainly as an adjunct in Statin Therapy to treat high levels of serum TAGs (> 10 mmol/l) even after Treatment.
- Therefore, useful in familial hypertriglyceridaemia and mixed hyperlipidaemias.
- Often used in combination with a statin, but this ↑ risk of muscle side effects.
- Abdominal side-effects (e.g. nausea, diarrhoea) are common.
- Mixed evidence on effectiveness on reducing Cardiovascular Risk means they are not recommended as first or second line for Secondary Prevention of CVD and are mainly restricted to instances of Hypertriglyceridaemia

---

# Bile Acid Sequestrants

- Bind to and therefore inhibit intestinal reabsorption of bile acids.
- Promotes hepatic conversion of cholesterol into bile acids and in turn, ↑ hepatic uptake of circulating LDL.
- Used mainly as an adjunct in difficult to control hypercholesterolaemia (primary and familial) within specialised Lipid Clinics.
- Use limited by side effect: interference with fat-soluble vitamin absorption (A, D, K), GI disturbance, can induce hypertriglyceridaemia.
- E.g Cholestyramine

---

# Niacin (Nicotinic Acid/Vitamin B3)

- ↓ fatty acid mobilisation from periphery and ↓ hepatic VLDL synthesis.
- Drug with largest impact on HDL.
- Very commonly causes GI symptoms and flushing (due to induction of prostaglandin production which can be ↓ by taking aspirin).
- Very rarely used due to side effects.
- Used primarily as an adjunct to statins, where there is severe Atherosclerosis and they are not achieving their target LDL (and ideally at lowest dose to avoid side effects).

# Omega-3-Acid Ethyl Esters

- Essential for human health (particularly brain, CNS).
- Cannot be synthesised.
- Main sources are fish, some plants and seed oils.
- Shown to ↓ inflammation and CVD experimentally.
- Clinical studies have not convincingly shown a clinical benefit in terms of ↓ in CVD.
- Have a modest effect on TAGs and little effect on cholesterol.
- May be used as an adjunct to treat hypertriglyceridaemia.

---

# Lomitapide

- ‘Orphan Drug’
- For patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia only (Usually Children with extremely raised LDL).
- Inhibits microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) which is necessary for enterocyte synthesis of chylomicrons and liver synthesis of VLDL.
- No evidence that it ↓ CV risk but it does ↓ LDL.

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 16.31.51.png](%5BUMP2029%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Lipid-Lowering%20Drugs%207b437ad734a9438ca4687e5bc14f708d/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_16.31.51.png)

---

# Newer Agents

- Some Cholesterol from HDL can be transferred to VLDL and LDL by CEPT (Cholesterylester Transfer Protein)
- Therefore, CEPT Antagonists should lower LDL and Raise HDL however, this drug class has not yet been successful

### PCSK9i

- mAb against PCSK9 increases Hepatic LDL-R Expression, increasing Hepatic Uptake of LDL to reduce Serum LDL levels
- E.g Evolocumab and Alirocumab
- They produce a 50-70% Reduction in LDL (Greater than that seen in statins alone) with Evolocumab also reducing risk of CVD Events
- However, they must be injected multiple times a year (E.g Evolocumab = Every 2 weeks) and they are expensive
- They are only recommended for Px with Established CVD and Persistently High LDL where Statins are ineffective/poorly tolerated or Primary Heterozygous FH with Persistently high LDL

---

# Management Algorithm

1. Start Px on 20mg Atorvastatin
2. Check Lipids 3 months later and if they have not reached <40% reduction in Non-HDL Cholesterol, increase Statin Dose and then add Ezetimibe if after Maximum Statin Therapy, Px does not reach target Cholesterol Reduction

![Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 16.43.10.png](%5BUMP2029%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Lipid-Lowering%20Drugs%207b437ad734a9438ca4687e5bc14f708d/Screenshot_2022-01-23_at_16.43.10.png)

1. Prescribe 80mg Atorvastatin unless there is a contraindication (E.g CKD → Start with 20mg, which can be increased to 40 mg if eGFR>30)
2. If Px does not reach 40% reduction in Non-HDL Cholesterol and LDL <1.8 mmol/L, Add Ezetimibe
3. If Px has still not reached Target Cholesterol Level and LDL > 3.5 mmo/L, give PSCK9i
