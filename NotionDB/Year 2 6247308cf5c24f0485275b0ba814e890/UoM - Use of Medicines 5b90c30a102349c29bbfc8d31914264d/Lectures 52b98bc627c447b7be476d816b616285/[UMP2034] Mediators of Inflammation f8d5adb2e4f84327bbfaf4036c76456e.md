# [UMP2034] Mediators of Inflammation

# Role of Kinins In Inflammatory Response

### Synthesis of Bradykinin

- Bradykinin is a pro-inflammatory peptide
- It can be formed by the HMW Kininogen Pathway in the Plasma and the LMW Kininogen pathway in the Tissue
- Found predominantly in circulation where it is activated by coagulation cascade.
- Prekallikrein is converted to plasma kallikrein by HMWK (high molecular weight kininogen).
- This HMWK itself is then broken down by kallikrein to produce bradykinin.
- In this pathway, Prekallikrein is a Zygomen that is activated by HMW Kininogen
- In tissues, LMW Kininogen is broken down by Tissue Kallikreins to form Kallidin/Lys-Bradykinin, which is further degraded by Aminopeptidases to form Bradykinin
- Bradykinin is inactivated by peptidases.
- Carboxypeptidase/Kininase can break down Bradykinin (From the HMWK Pathway) into Des-Arg9-Bradykinin (DABK) or Lys-Bradykinin/Kallidin (From LMWK Pathway) into Lys-Des-Arg9-Bradykinin
- These breakdown products and Bradykinin have different affinities for the Bradykinin Receptors
- Kininase II completely inactivates Bradykinin

# Bradykinin Receptors (Rhodopsin Family)

- Bradykinin works on receptors (B1 and B2) which are GPCRs.
- B2 receptors are constitutively expressed on a variety of tissues, notably Sensory Nerves and Endothelium
- B1 Receptor expression can be induced in response to Proinflammatory Cytokines and Endotoxins
- Vascular Effects of Bradykinin are due to its effects on B2, where it produces its effects via Upregulation of Prostaglandins and NO
- Icatinabt is an antagonist for B2 receptor, but no B2 antagonists are clinically available.
- Significance of B1 receptor in inflammation is unclear but they may be involved in Chronic Inflammation.

![Screenshot 2022-01-31 at 12.53.41.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-31_at_12.53.41.png)

- Bradykinin is Selective for B2 with little activity on B1
- Kallidin (Formed via Tissue pathway) shows activity at B1 and B2, showing slight B2 selectivity
- Des-Arg10 Kallidin (Formed by Breakdown of Kallidin) shows affinity for B1 but not B2
- Affinity of Kinin Metabolites varies across Species

# Control of BP with ACEi

- ACE-I are relatively non-selective as ACE is the same enzyme as Kininase II:
1. Prevents conversion of angiotensin I → angiotensin II.
2. Prevents breakdown of bradykinin.
- This is not a problem when ACE-I is used in treatment of hypertension, as bradykinin accumulation cause vasodilation, which is effective in reducing BP.
- Unfortunately, bradykinin is also a mediator of inflammation, and can cause cough, and can also participate in formation of angioedema (significant swelling of vascular beds just deep to the skin), often following acute injury/inflammation.

# Angioedema and Tts Treatment

### Angioedema

- Angioedema can be drug-induced (E.g ACEi) or hereditary (C1 Inhibitor deficiency), occurring due to accumulation of Bradykinin following Acute Injury/Inflammation
- Hereditary Angioedema is characterised by recurrent episodes of Angioedema, leading to Px being regularly admitted to A&E (2-3x a week)
- Hereditary Angioedema often causes Swelling of Vascular Beds around the airways, leading to Airway Obstruction
- There are 3 types of Hereditary Angioedema, with 2 of these being associated with Deficiency in C1 Esterase Inhibitor which inhibits the Classical Complement Pathway by preventing the formation of C1q
- This can be Rx via Recombinant C1 Inhibitor to restore regulation of C1q formation (Classical Pathway) which shows rapid improvement/resolution of Sx and can be used as Prophylaxis against Angioedema

### Treatment of Angioedema

**Drug Induced Angioedema (E.g ACEi)**

- Take patient off ACE-I: This increases Kininase II activity and that of other Carboxypeptidases (Which degrade Proinflammatory Complement components) to allow for the breakdown of bradykinin.
- Icatibant: B2 receptor antagonist → Block the activity of Bradykinin on B2 and hence, Vasodilation.

# Plasma Component of Inflammatory Response

- Inflammatory Mediators can be derived from Plasma Components via the Coagulation, Fibrinolytic Cascade, Kinin Cascade and Complement Cascade
- Therapeutic Modulation of Inflammation can be modulated by altering the activity of the Complement and Kinin Cascades

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 15.32.16.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_15.32.16.png)

# Complement

- Divided into Classical, Lectin and Alternate pathway that respond to Ab-Ag Complexes via C1q, Sugars and Carbohydrates on Microbial Membranes and C3b binding to Microbes
- All of these cascades converge onto a Common Final pathway, which leads to the production of Proinflammatory Compounds (Anaphylatoxins → C3a and C5a) and MAC which leads to pore formation in Microbes and direct Lysis
- C3b produces is also an Opsonin

![Screenshot 2022-01-31 at 13.23.58.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-31_at_13.23.58.png)

### Regulation

- Due to the potency of the Complement System, it can lead to significant tissue damage if uncontrolled
- This means there are various endogenous regulators/inhibitors of various molecules in the Complement System to regulate its activity
- Decay-Accelerative C3 convertase breaks down C4b2a (Classical and Alternate C3 Convertase) into C4b and C2a to prevent C3a generation
- Factor I can degrade and inactive C3b and C4b
- Various other regulators can inhibit MAC formation

![Screenshot 2022-01-31 at 13.24.32.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-31_at_13.24.32.png)

# Snake Bite

- Many snake bites rely on activating complement.
- Cobra venom factor (CVF) is complement-activating protein from cobra venom and is structurally similar to C3b
- CVF is able to form CVFBb complex which is relatively stable and is resistant to degradation by factor I and H.
- This goes on to activate complement cascade in serum.

# Pathologies Associated With Complement Regulator Deficiency

- Rare and can be life threatening.
- These are mainly used to Rx Angioedema and Transplant Rejection
- Eculizumab has been shown to be effective in reducing Sx for Px with COVID-19

# Eicosanoid Synthesis

- Eicosanoids can be synthesised by Enzymatic or Non-Enzymatic Oxidation of Arachidonic Acid or other Polyunsaturated FAs
- Phospholipase A2 liberates Arachidonic Acid from Phospholipid Cell membrane, which can then be converted into different classes of Eicosanoids
- Main Class is Prostaglands and Thromboxanes, with their synthesis being controlled by COX/Cyclooxygenases
- 5-Lipoxygenase produces Leukotrienes, which are important in Lung Physiology and Pathophysiology
- 15-Lipoxygenase synthesises Lipoxins which are anti-inflammatory
- 12-HETE (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acid) is synthesised from Arachidonic Acid via 12-Lipoxygenase and is involved in Chemotaxis and Anti-Inflammation

![Screenshot 2022-01-31 at 13.35.20.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-31_at_13.35.20.png)

---

# Phospholipase A2

- Liberates Arachidonic Acid from Phosphatidylcholine in the Plasma Membrane
- Phospholipase A2 can be inhibited by Annexin 1/Lipocortin 1 which can be upregulated by Glucocorticoids
- Activity of Phospholipase A2 causes the release of PAF/Platelet Activating Factor which is a potent Pro-inflammatory mediator, acting on Gs or Gq linked GPCRs
- PAF increases Vascular Permeability, Bronchoconstriction, Chemotaxin and Vasodilation

![Screenshot 2022-01-31 at 13.40.06.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-31_at_13.40.06.png)

# Prostaglandin and Thromboxane Synthesis

- Cyclooxygenase is the Rate Limiting enzyme in Prostaglandin and Thromboxane Synthesis and converts Arachidonic Acid into PGH2
- COX is the drug target that is inhibited by NSAIDs
- PGH2 is converted into other Prostaglandins and Thromboxane A2 by the action of specific Synthases
- PGH2 → PGE2 (Prostagladin E2 Synthase)
- All Prostaglandins and Thromboxane A2 act via GPCRs in a variety of Signalling Mechanisms using Gs, Gi and Gq G proteins

![Screenshot 2022-01-31 at 13.43.10.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-31_at_13.43.10.png)

# Prostanoids General

- Prostanoids = Prostaglandins and Thromboxanes
- They are Synthesised by most cell types via the convertion of Arachidonic Acid by COX followed by the action of Prostaglandin Synthases
- They are C20 Molecules with an OH group at C15 which is essential for their activity
- They are transported into cell via Transport Proteins. Here they are broken down by 15-PDGH (15-Hydroxyprostaglandindehydroganase), inactivating Prostanoids via the removal of the C15-OH Group
- PGI2 and TXA2 are broken down by Hydrolysis
- Prostaglandins are very potent, acting at Nanomolar or even, Picomolar Concentrations

---

# PGE2

- One of  the most common Prostaglandins in the Body

### PGE2 Synthesis

- Synthesised by 2 isoforms of PGE2 Synthase:
1. Cytosolic PGEs (PGE synthase): constitutively active.
2. Membrane PGES: induced with inflammatory mediators.

### Receptors

- EP1 - Contraction of bronchial, Uterine and GI smooth muscle; pain via Gq.
- EP2 (Most important for Inflammation) - Potentiates vascular permeability, Vasodilation and Oedema when in synergy with other inflamamtory mediators via Gs
- EP3 - Potentiates pain, causes Hyperthermia (Fever) and stimulates Gastric Mucous Secretion to protect the Stomach against Gastric Acid and pathogens via Gi.
- EP4 - Antiinflammatory by inhibiting Leukocyte Proliferation, Leukocyte Activation and production of Proinflammatory Cytokines via Gs.

### Actions

- Fever → ↑ body temperature via hypothalamus to create a hostile environment for pathogenic growth and activity and to increase the rate of reaction of anti-microbial mechanisms.
- Pain → Induces hyperalgesia working both at peripheral terminals of primary afferent nociceptors and in spine.
- Oedema → Powerful vasodilator and synergises with other mediators. Does not directly induce vascular permeability but potentiates action of other inflammatory mediators.
- Leukocytes → Inhibits actions of many leukocytes to produce anti-inflammatory effects

---

# Other Prostaglandins

### PGD2

- Synthesied by Prostaglandin D synthase, found in most cell types.
- PGD2 has 2 receptors, with greater affinity for DP2 than DP1
- There are 2 isoforms of PGD2 Synthase:
1. Haematopoetic-Type → In Mast Cells (This is associated with PGD2 Production in Inflammation)
2. Lipocalin-Type → In Brain Tissue
- DP1-receptors: downregulates Leukocyte Activation and Cytokine Production, vasodilation, bronchodilation, sleep induction
- CRTH 2 (PGD2 receptor): chemoattractant for Th2 cells and hence, involved in Allergy, Increases vascular permeability, maintenance of allergic reactions following release from Mast Cells

### PGF2α

- Synthesised by PGF2α Synthase, predominantly by Smooth Muscle Cells and is inactivated within the Pulmonary Circulation
- FP-receptor: Airway, GI and Uterine Contraction. Its main role is in pregnancy and birth
- It may also be involved in contraction/activation of Lymphatic Vessels

### PGI2

- Also known as Prostacyclin and is anti-inflammatory
- Produced by Prostaglandin I synthase predominantly in vascular endothelium.
- It has a half life of 3 mins and is metabolised into an inactive, stable compound (6-keto-PGF1α) via Non-Enzymatic Hydrolysis
- IP-receptor: vasodilation, inhibit platelet aggregation, reduces gastric acid release and may increase pain

### TXA2

- It is synthesised by Thromboxane A synthase found predominantly in platelets where it is pro-inflammatory.
- It has a very short t1/2 (30s) and is hydrolysed non-enzymatically into an inactive stable compound TXB2
- TP-receptor: vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation.
- Balance of TXA2 and PGI2 levels is important for determining Vascular Tone and the probability of Platelet Aggregation

# Leukotriene Synthesis

- 5-Lipoxygenase synthesises 5-HPETE from Arachidonic Acid
- 5-HPETE can either be metabolised into LTB4 by LTA4 Hydrolase or via the LTC4-LTD4-LTE4 System of Enzymes to produce Cysteinyl Leukotrienes
- LTB4 works on BLTR1 or BLTR2
- Cystenyl Leukotrienes work on Cys-LT1  or Cys-LT2

![Screenshot 2022-01-31 at 14.10.48.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-31_at_14.10.48.png)

---

# Leukotriene Actions

### Leukotriene B4

- LTA4 Hydrolase is widely distributed in various cell types
- BLT4 Receptors are the Major Receptor for LTB4 found in Leukocytes
- Actions include Leukocyte Chemotaxis, Cytokine Secretion and IgE Synthesis
- PPAR-α → Nuclear Receptor that controls LTB4 Metabolism

### Cysteinyl Leukotrienes

- They are formed via the Synthesis of LTC4 via Leukotriene C4 Synthase, followed by the spontaneous production of LTD4 and LTE4
- LTD4 and LTE4 are agonists at Cys-LT1 Receptors and produce smooth muscle Contraction in Pulmonary vessels

### Drugs

- As Leukotrienes predominantly act on the Lungs during Inflammation, drugs against Leukotrienes tend to be used in the Rx of Asthma
- Zileuton = 5-Lipoxygenase Inhibitor that inhibits FLAP, which is important in the activation of 5-Lipoxygenase
- Montelukast and Zafirlukast are Cysteinyl Leukotriene Antagonists

---

# Alternative Sources of Prostaglandins and Leukotriene Synthesis

- COX and Lipooxygenase Pathway which synthesise Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes respectively can also metabolise Omega-3 PUFAs such as Docosahexaenoic Acid/DHA (alongside Omega-6 PUFAs like Arachidonic Acid)
- Products from the Metabolism of Omega-3 PUFAs generate Eicosanoids that are anti-inflammatory
- Therefore, increased Omega 3 PUFA Content in the Diet (E.g Fish Oils) may be effective in reducing inflammation but this has not yet been demonstrated by clinical trials

---

# Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

### History

- B.C. - Willow bark used by Egyptians.
- 1763 - Rev. Stone report to Royal Society showed that Willow Bark and leaves extract can relieve fever and malaise.
- 1828 - Johhann Buchner isolates Salicin from willow bark.
- 1833 - E. Merck improved extraction process.
- 1874 - First large scale production of Salicylic acid, which had poor compliance due to bitter taste.
- 1898 - Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) synthesised by Felix Hoffman at Bayer to improve compliance.
- 1957 - S Bergstrom isolates first prostaglandins.
- 1964 - First characterisation of a cyclooxygenase activity.
- 1971 - J Vane publishes on mechanism of action of Aspirin.
- 1991 - Cyclooxygenase-2 discovered.
- 1998-99 - Release of Celebrex (Searle) and Vioxx (Merck)

---

# Cyclooxygenase Cascade

- Prostaglandin H2 Synthase = Cyclooxygenase and has 2 different enzymatic functions:
1. Cyclooxygenase - Arachdonic Acid → PGG2
2. Peroxidase - PGG2 → PGH2

![Screenshot 2022-01-31 at 17.37.53.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-31_at_17.37.53.png)

# NSAIDs and Cyclooxygenases

- NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase from producing prostaglandins
- This reduced Prostaglandin Mediated Pyrexia, Inflammation and Nociception but also inhibited production of Physiological Prostaglandins involved in normal functioning (Inhibiting Gastric Acid Secretion, Increasing renal blood flow and contraction of the Uterus)
- PGE2 and PGE1 are important for gastric protection (via EP3 activity, they inhibit gastric acid secretion and ↑ gastric mucous/↑ bicarbonate production).
- People who took NSAIDs had peptic ulcers as they inhibit these Gastric Protective Prostaglandins and previously, this was a significant cause of Death.

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 15.51.13.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_15.51.13.png)

- COX-1 was thought to produce prostaglandins with physiological effects (in non-inflammatory states), being constituently expressed in many cells.
- COX-2 was associated with Prostaglandins produced in Inflammation that mediate Pathophysiology, with its expression upregulated by Leukocyte secreted Inflammatory Mediators
- Classical NSAIDs targeted both COX-1 and COX-2.
- However, NSAIDs were developed that were COX-2 Effective to inhibit production of Prostaglandins that mediated pathology (E.g Inflammation) but not those that were important for Physiological Functions (E.g Gastric Mucosa Protection) and hence, produce limited side effects

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 15.51.48.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_15.51.48.png)

- There are around 40 NSAIDs available, and these can be classified according to their selectivity towards COX-1 or COX-2.
- Ibuprofen and Aspirin are shown to be have a greater COX-1 than COX-2 Selectivity but inhibit both isoforms
- Meloxicam and Nimesulide are slightly more selective for COX-2 than COX-1 and hence, had fewer effects on Prostaglandin-Mediated Gastric Protection
- Valde**coxib** and Rofexocib are strongly selective for COX-2 over COX-1 whilst Celecoxib has been shown to be a weak inhibitor of COX-2
- Paracetamol is associated with NSAIDs due to its Anti-Pyretic and Analgesics effects but there is weak evidence to suggest that it acts on COX and hence, it is not classed as an NSAID (Its mode of Action is not completely known)

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 15.52.10.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_15.52.10.png)

### COX-1 vs COX-2

- COX-2 has Val-532, Val-434 and Arg-513
- COX-1 has Isoleucine instead of Valine and Histidine instead of Arg at these 3 sites
- This means that COX-2 has a larger Catalytic Site than COX-1, meaning larger drugs can be developed that can fit into the COX-2 Catalytic site but are too large to enter the COX-1 Site to produce selective COX-2 Inhibition

![Screenshot 2022-01-31 at 17.13.27.png](%5BUMP2034%5D%20Mediators%20of%20Inflammation%20f8d5adb2e4f84327bbfaf4036c76456e/Screenshot_2022-01-31_at_17.13.27.png)

# Vioxx (Rofecoxib)

- Approved in May 1999 by the FDA for Osteoarthritis, RA, Acute Pain Condition and Migraine, producing similar Analgesic and Anti-inflammatory effects as other Classical NSAIDs but with reduced GI Side Effects (E.g Peptic Ulcers
- It was voluntary withdrawn from the Market in September 2004 due to concerns that it increased the risk of MI and strokes
- In November 2007, $4.85 billion to settle legal claims that drug caused many users to suffer strokes and heart failure.
- It was eventually found that all NSAIDs have ↑ CV risk (although some produced a greater increase than others) and that Selective COX-2 Inhibitors do not produce a greater increase in CV Risk than Other NSAIDs.
- This includes risks of MIs, Strokes
- The CVD risk associated with Non-Aspirin NSAIDs can occur soon after commencing treatment and increases with larger doses and longer duration of treatment
- Naproxen seems to produce a less significant increase in CV Risk than other NSAIDs
- Vioxx can be used to treat Haemophilic Arthropathy (Osteoarthritis due to Haemophilia)

---

# NSAIDs and CVD

- Venous Thrombosis causes venous congestion and oedema whereas Arterial Thrombosis leads to Ischaemia/Necrosis

---

# Inhibition of COX By Aspirin

- All NSAIDs are reversible inhibitors of COXs whereas Aspirin is an irreversible inhibitor of COX
- Aspirin covalently and irreversibly cases the acetylation of Serine-529 in COX-1 and COX-2
- This produced steric hindrance of the Acetylated Serine so that Arachidonic Acid can not longer be metabolised by the COX-1
- In COX-2, the larger active site meant that this was only a partial inhibition, allowing it to produce 15R-HETE instead of PGH2, which has anti-inflammatory properties
- Low Dose Aspirin can be used to reduce the risk of MI and Strokes in Px with a Hx of CVD
- In Primary Haemostasis, Vascular Damage causes aggregation and activation of Platelets, releasing various Vasoconstrictors like TXA2 (Also causes Platelet Aggregation)
- Aspirin inhibits COX in both Platelets and Vascular Endothelium, leading to reduced TXA2 and PGI2 formation
- However, as Platelets are anucleate, any COX1 that is inhibited by Aspirin cannot be replaced by functional COX1 via Increased COX1 Expression, meaning COX remains inhibited for the lifetime of the Platelet so that platelets can no longer produce TXA2
- In contrast, Vascular Endothelial Cells contain a Nucleus and hence, can replace inhibited COX1 via Increased Gene Expression to regain the ability to produce PGI2
- This means that Aspirin causes more PGI2 to be produced by Vascular Endothelium and less TXA2 produced by Platelets, meaning that there is greater inhibition than promotion of Platelet Aggregation, reducing the risk of Platelet Aggregation and hence, Thrombus formation
- This meant that Aspirin reduce CVD risk in Px who have a history of CVD (Px at Higher Risk) by reducing the likelihood of Platelet Aggregation
