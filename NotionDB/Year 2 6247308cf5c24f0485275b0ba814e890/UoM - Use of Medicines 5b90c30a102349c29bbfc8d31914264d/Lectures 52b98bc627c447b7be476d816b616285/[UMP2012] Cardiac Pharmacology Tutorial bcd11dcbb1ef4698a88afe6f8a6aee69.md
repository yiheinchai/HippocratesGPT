# [UMP2012] Cardiac Pharmacology Tutorial

# Factors Affecting BP

1. CO (SV and HR)
2. TPR via Arterioles
3. Venous Capacitance → Determines Preload
4. Blood Volume (Via RAAS)

### SNS Effects on Blood Pressure

- NA is more selective for Alpha than Beta receptors
- Beta 2-AR is stimulated cause Skeletal Muscle Arteriole vasodilation via NA Collaterals

---

# Drugs Targetting SNS that affect BP

1. Beta Blockers → Propanolol, Atenolol etc.
2. Alpha 1 Antagonists → Doxasozin, Tamsulozin, Prazosin 
3. Alpha 2 Agonists → Clonidine
4. Ganglion Blockers → Trimethophan and Hexamethonium
5. NA Biosynthesis Blockers → Alpha-MethylDOPA
6. **Adrenergic Neuron Blockers → Guanefidine**

# RAAS In Hypertension

1. Renin Antagonists → Aliskiren
2. ACEi → Ramipril, Captopril
3. ARB → Losartan, Candesartan
4. Mineralocorticoid Antagonists → Spironolactone, Eplerenone

---

# Vasodilators

1. Calcium Channel Blockers → Dihydropyridine, Benzothiazepine and Phenylalkylamines
- Dihydropyridines are Vasoselective (all end in -Ipine) whereas the other Calcium Channel Blockers act on the Heart and Vasculature
1. K+ Channel Openers → KATP Selective such as Minoxidil
2. Hydralazine and NO Donors

# Case Study

- 35 year old man, overweight → ACEi or ARB if Px can't tolerate Sx
- BP = 178/114
- Smoker, Drinker, Sedentery, High Sat Fat and Salt Food.
- Stops smoking, loses weight but remained hypertensive → Gave him Atenolol → Developing Side Effects (Weakness)
- Perhaps give him another med instead of Beta Blocker and Ix Secondary Cause

---

# Anti-Arrhythmics

1. Na+ Channel Blocker → Disopyramide, Lidocaine, Flecanide
2. Beta Blocker → Atenolol (Selective) or Propanolol (Non-Selective)
3. K+ Channel Blocker → Amiodarone and Sotalol
4. Ca2+ Channel Blocker → Verapamil and Diltiazem
5. Cardiac Glycoside → Digoxin → Causes cells to retain positivity and produces a depolarising block which inactivates channels

# Re-Entrant

- **Ischaemic Damage to the Myocardial Column means there is slowed orthodromic Conduction and blocked antidromic conduction through the damaged section**
- **This means that the slowed orthodromic signalling travelling through the Ischaemic Myocardium can pass through the Myocardial Bridge between myocardial columns that due to the slow conduction, is no longer refractory and can be excited, allowing for the generation of Re-entrant Circuits**
