# [UMP2035] Pharmacology of Reproductive Hormones

# Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis

### Females

- FSH mainly acts on the first half of the  Ovarian Cycle (Maturation of Follicle) whereas LH mainly acts on the second half of the Ovarian Cycle (Release of Oocyte from the Graafian Follicle)
- Progesterone has simple negative feedback to inhibit GnRH Release from the Hypothalamus and LH and FSH Release from the Anterior Pituitary Gland
- At Low Doses, Oestrogens exert negative feedback inhibition of the Hypothalamus and Anterior Pituitary Gland to reduce GnRH and LH/FSH Release
- At High Doses for >36 hrs, Oestrogens exert positive feedback inhibition of the Anterior Pituitary Gland to sensitise GnRH Receptors to increase LH/FSH Release

### Males

- LH = ICSH = Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone

# GnRH

- This is a decapeptide/10AA released from hypothalamic neurones into the Hypophyseal Portal System, where it is transported to the Gonadotrophs in the Anterior Pituitary Gland
- It stimulates Gonadotrophs via G-protein coupled (Gq)

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 15.09.04.png](%5BUMP2035%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Reproductive%20Hormones%2054a2e5e0d41c45048b396a4fb817a580/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_15.09.04.png)

### Action

- Stimulate gonadotropin release in a pulsatile-dependent manner physiologically:
- Low frequency GnRH Pulsation favours FSH release
- High frequency GnRH Pulsation favours LH release
- Continuous (non-physiological or pharmacologically)
- This produces an initial increase in LH and FSH Release due to overstimulation of GnRH, followed by down-regulation of GnRH Receptors (in an attempt to lower LH/FSH Signalling back to normal) → inhibition of FSH & LH release

### GnRH Agonists

- E.g. Gonadorelin, Leuprorelin
- Uses:
1. When used in Pulsatile dosing (Less Common), they can be used to Rx
- Male infertility (and rarely, female infertility to stimulate ovulation)
1. When used Continuous Dosing (More Common), it can be used to Rx:
- Ovulation induction (Downregulation of GnRH Activity reduces Endogenous Gonadotropin Synthesis, allowing clinicians to prescribe exogenous Gonadotropins to allow for fine-control of Ovulation in ART/Assisted Reproductive Technology)
- Prostate Cancer - As Prostate Cancer growth is Androgen Dependent, Inhibition of LH Production reduces Testosterone Synthesis which in turn reduces prostate cancer growth (Often given alongside Anti-Androgens to reduce the impact of the Initial LH/FSH Spike seen when starting Rx)
- Endometriosis → Ectopic growth of Endometrial Tissue. By Suppressing Cyclical Fluctuations in Oestrogen and Progesterone Levels, Pain and other Sx associated with Necrosis and Growth of Ectopic Endometrial Tissue is reduced
- Precocious Puberty → Depot GnRH Agonist Administration allows for the slow release of GnRH over a sustained period of time, allowing for prolonged decreased in LH and FSH to inhibit Sex Steroid Production to delay Puberty till the normal time

### GnRH Antagonists

- E.g. Ganirelix, Degarelix
- Uses:
1. Ovulation induction (Suppress Endogenous Gonadotrophin Activity to that Exogenous Gonadotropins can be used to finely control Ovulation for ART)
2. Prostate/Breast cancer → Suppress Androgen and Oestrogen Mediated Growth

---

# Gonadotropins - FSH, LH and hCG

- Heterodimeric glycoproteins with a common α (seen in all 3 hormones) + different β subunit
- released - by anterior pituitary (FSH & LH) or by placenta (hCG)
- Receptors = G-protein coupled (Gs)

### FSH Actions

**Women**

1. Stimulate follicle development
2. Stimulate oestrogen production in follicle
(Notably from androgen precursors, notably in the 1st Half of the Ovarian Cycle)
3. ↑ LH receptor expression in Graafian follicle

**Men**

- Stimulate Sertoli cells to nourish sperm to allow for efficient Spermatogenesis and Spermiogenesis

### LH Actions

**Women**

1. Stimulate Androgen synthesis in follicle
(As oestrogen precursors during the 1st half of Ovarian cycle)
2. stimulate dominant follicle development and rupture (ovulation)
3. ruptured follicle → Corpus Luteum (CL)
(directs steroid production in the Ovarian 2nd half of cycle)

**Men**

1. Stimulates testosterone production

---

# Oestrogen Synthesis

- Oestrogens are synthesised by Androgens
- FSH Binds to receptors in the Granulosa Cells of the Follicles (Inner Layer), to upregulate Aromatase Expression, increasing the conversion of Androgens to Oestrogens
- LH binds to Thecal Cells of the Follicles (Outer Layer) to upregulate 17,20 Lyase, involved in Androgen Synthesis by the Follicle

# FSH & LH In Female Cycle

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 15.45.11.png](%5BUMP2035%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Reproductive%20Hormones%2054a2e5e0d41c45048b396a4fb817a580/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_15.45.11.png)

---

# hCG

- produced by Placenta and tissue surrounding the site of implantation
- It is almost identical to LH (acts on LHR)

### hCG Action

- Maintain corpus luteum of Pregancy (CL) function in 1st trimester of pregnancy so that progesterone and Oestrogen synthesis are sustained in this period

---

# Gonadotropins - FSH, LH and hCG

- Preparations:
1. Urofollitropin (uFSH) → FSH Purified from Urine of Pregnant Women (Not Common)
2. Follitropin (rFSH)
3. Lutropin (rLH)
4. Choriogonadotropin (rhCG)
- These are recombinant forms of Gonadotropins which are more commonly used
- Uses:
1. Male infertility (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism → Where Lack of Gonadotrophins causes undermaturation of Male Genitalia, leading to infertility)
2. Female - Ovulation induction (for ART alongside GnRH Agonists/Antagonists)
3. Female - Diagnostic: hCG detected by pregnancy kits and LH detected in ovulation kits to identify pregnant and ovulating women

---

# Oestrogens

- Natural: 17-β Oestradiol, Oestrone, Oestriol → These are rapidly absorbed orally but also rapidly metabolised
- Synthetic: e.g. mestranol, ethinyl oestradiol → These have a longer half life than Natural Oestrogens and hence, are often preferred
- Produced by - ovaries (Follicle before Fertilisation and Corpus Luteum of Prengancy after Fertilisation during the 1st Trimester) or placenta
- Receptors - Ligand-Activated Transcription Factor (EFα and EFβ)
- These are found in an inactive monomeric form in the Nucleus when not bound and when the Ligands are bound, HSPs are shed, allowing the Dimerisation of the Receptors
- This Activated Dimer then binds to EREs on specific Genes to alter Transcriptional Activity
- GPER1 - Is an Oestrogen Responsive GPCR expressed on the Cell Surface, mainly in the Vasculature, but its function is unknown

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 15.49.42.png](%5BUMP2035%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Reproductive%20Hormones%2054a2e5e0d41c45048b396a4fb817a580/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_15.49.42.png)

### Action - Reproductive Tissues

1. Female development (Embryonic and Puberty)
2. Cyclical effects on uterus
- Especially important in the Proliferation of Endometrium in the Proliferative Phase f the Menstruation Cycle where it stimulates Endometrial proliferation
(including ↑ expression of Progesterone R to prime the Endometrial Cells for Maintenance via Sustained Progesterone Signalling if Pregnancy occurs)
1. Favouring cervical secretion
(↑volume, ↓viscosity) from Cervical Glands to support the movement of Sperm towards the Ova for Fertilisation

### Action - Non-Reproductive Tissues

1. metabolic
- Anabolic (Protein Synthesis)
- Mild Retention of salt and water
1. cardiovascular
- Maintain normal vascular function (Vasodilation and Maintaining Vascular Integrity)
- ↑ coagulability of blood
- ↑ HDL and ↓ LDL & cholesterol to reduce Atheroma formation
1. Reduce bone resorption by Inhibiting OCs

### Uses

- Contraception (+ progestogen)
- Menopausal Hormone Therapy (± progestogen)

### Oestrogen Antagonist

- Clomiphene
- Acts to Antagonise Oestrogen Receptors on the Anterior Pituitary and Hypothalamic which mediated Oestrogen-Dependent Negative Feedback
- This hence reduces Inhibition of GnRH and LH/FSH Secretion and is used to induce ovulation in infertility

---

# Molecular Mechanisms of Nuclear ERs

- When ERs are unbound, they are found in a monomeric form in the Nucleus
- Binding of Oestrogen Agonists to the ER causes Dimerisation of the ER, allowing it to bind to EREs
- The ER-agonist-DNA complex recruits coactivators to upregulate transcription
- If Oestrogen Antagonists bind to the ER, the ER-Antagonist Complex binds to EREs and recruits corepressors to downregulate transcription
- SERM = Single molecule that acts as agonist in some tissues (at one isotype of ER) and antagonist in other tissues where different isotypes of ER are expressed

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 15.55.12.png](%5BUMP2035%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Reproductive%20Hormones%2054a2e5e0d41c45048b396a4fb817a580/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_15.55.12.png)

# Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)

- Raloxifene - to prevent osteoporosis in post-menopausal women who are at increased risk
- Acts as an antagonist in breast and uterus so that it does not increase Oestrogen Activity here to increase the risk of cancer
- It is a partial agonist in bones (Increase Oestrogen-Mediated OC inhibition to prevent Bone Resorption) and Liver (Maintains synthesis of proteins that regulate blood lipids and enzymes that determine coagulability, allowing for maintenance of blood lipid homeostasis but causing Blood Hypercoagulability)
- Tamoxifen - to treat breast cancer
- Acts as an antagonist in breast to prevent Oestrogen-Driven Growth of Breast Tumours
- It is a partial agonist in bones (prevents bone resorption), liver (prevents Atheroma formation), uterus (Increased risk of Uterine Cancer)
- Aromatase Inhibitors (Anastrozole) - not SERMs, but also used to treat breast cancer by suppressing oestrogen synthesis from Androgen precursors, to reduce Oestrogen Mediated Breast Cancer growth

---

# Progestogens

- Natural: progesterone → Short Half Life
- Synthetic: levonorgestrel, norethisterone, desogestrel, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) → Longer Half Life
- produced by Corpus Luteum and Placenta
- Receptor = ligand-activated transcription factors found in the Nucleus as monomers that dimerise upon activation and bind to PREs to alter Gene Transcription

### Actions

1. Feedback action
- Decrease frequency of GnRH pulses
- Decrease FSH & LH release
1. Cyclical effects on uterus
- Stimulates the Endometrial Secretory Phase, mediating differentiation of Endometrial Cells (Glandular Differentiation, Increased Vascularisation etc.)
- Favouring cervical secretion to reduce flow through the Uterus to support Implantation (↓volume, ↑viscosity)
1. In pregnancy: They are invovled in development of Uterus and Breast and suppression of Contractility of the uterus until Childbirth

### Uses

- Contraception (± oestrogen)
- Menopausal Hormone Therapy (+ oestrogen)

### Progestogen Antagonist

- Mifepristone:
- Antagonist at Progesterone Receptors in Uterus
- Uses - Early pregnancy termination
(+ prostaglandin) by reducing Progesterone Signalling that is usually high due to the Corpus Luteum of Pregnancy. This mimics the drop in Progesterone (as seen at the end of the Normal Menstrual Cycle), favouring Menstruation and Endometrial Necrosis, releasing the Zygote from the Uterine Cavity/Endometrium

---

# Contraception

- Health need:
- Given choice, most women prefer limiting pregnancies
- 121 million unintended pregnancies/year with around 60% of these ending in abortions
- 73.3 million abortions/year, 45% of which are unsafe
- This means that 5 -13% of all pregnancy-related deaths are due to unsafe abortions

### Ovarian Cycles

- Despite Falling Levels of LH and FSH Secretion due to Low Levels of Oestrogen during the proliferative phase of the Endometrial Cycle, FSH Expression upregulates LH Receptors on the Graafian Follicle, causing sustained Oestrogen and Progesterone synthesis
- Peaks of FSH Correspond with those of LH, with LH peaking to a greater level than FSH just prior to ovulation, with Oestrogen reaching a similar height to the Pre-ovulatory LH peak but Oestrogen peak precedes this (As Raised Oestrogen Stimulated LH Surge)
- Where as Oestrogen Favours Endometrial Differentiation in the first Half/Follicular Phase of the Endometrial Cycle, Progesterone Inhibits Endometrial Proliferation (It maintains its size) in the Second Half/Luteal Phase of the Endometrial Cycle but rather promotes Endometrial Differentiation to Synthesise Glycogen Secreting Glands and vasculature to supply the Embryo upon implantation

# Combined Hormonal Contraceptive

- Oestrogen and Progestogen
- E.g. ethinyl-oestradiol + norethisterone
- administration: oral traditionally and more modernly transdermal patch, vaginal ring
- Traditional therapy was 21 days/3 Weeks of active medication (Pill, Patch or Ring) followed by 7 days/one week hormone-free
- More recently, “tailored” hormonal regimes are more common, comprised of less frequent/shorter hormone-free intervals to reduce periods

### Mechanisms of Action

1. Oestrogen
- Contraceptive Provides low level of Oestrogen activity, which acts via negative feedback to reduce GnRH and LH/FSH Release from the Hypothalamus and Anterior Pituitary Gland
- Lack of FSH Means that there is:
- Follicle fails to develop and mature
- No endogenous LH surge as there is no raised Oestrogen Levels via the activity of the Corpus Luteum (which has been prevented to form via lack of Follicular Maturation), leading to anovulation
1. Progestogen:
- Prevents high frequency GnRH Pulses, preventing LH surge from occurring → no ovulation
- Cervical mucus unfavourable for fertilization (high viscocity, low volume → Sperm is stuck within the mucous and cannot fertilise the ovum)
1. Oestrogen + Progestogen:
- Abnormal endometrial development
→ conditions become unfavourable for implantation

### Adverse Effects

- Small ↑ risk of cervical cancer
- Small ↑ risk of breast cancer (but risk of Breast cancer for someone who has never used Combined Hormonal Contraceptive = That of someone who previously used it)
- ↓ risk of ovarian, endometrial and colorectal cancer
- Small ↑ risk of venous thromboembolic disease due to blood hypercoagulability
- Small ↑ risk of stroke and myocardial infarction due to blood hypercoagulability

---

# Contraception - Progestogen Only

- Progestogen
- E.g. norethisterone, levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)
- Administration:
- oral, injectables (MPA → Lasts 3 months), patches, implants
- Continuous administration (causing irregular menstruation due to no periods where hormone is not taken)

### Mechanisms of Action

- Mechanisms of action:
1. Cervical mucus unfavourable for fertilization (Mucous becomes viscous and low volume → Sperm is stuck within the mucous and cannot fertilise the ovum)
2. Endometrium unsuitable for implantation as Raised Progesterone inhibits Endometrial Proliferation,
3. In some (60-80%) preparations: Progesterone levels are so high that it causes inhibition of LH surge → no ovulation
- Therefore, missing a dose around the time of normal ovulation can prevent inhibition of Ovulation, which can lead to ovulation and an increased risk of pregnancy
- Adverse:
1. Irregular bleeding
2. Reversible bone resorption → Mainly from MPA

---

# Menopausal Hormone Therapy

- Post-menopausal syndrome → Ovarian Function declines, causing Oestrogen and Progesterone Levels to decrease whilst FSH and LH levels increase
1. Vasomotor symptoms (Hot Flushes)
2. Urogenital atrophy (Atrophy of Oestrogen Dependent tissues)
3. ↑ Bone resorption (osteoporosis → Reduced Inhibition of OCs via Oestrogen Action)
4. ↑ Atheroma formation (As Reduced Oestrogen causes LDL to rise and HDL to fall)
- Hormone Replacement Treatments (HRT):
1. Oestrogen + progestogen
2. Oestrogen alone (hysterectomized women) - This is because in normal women, Raised Oestrogen without Raised Progesterone would cause overproliferation of the Uterus, increasing the risk of Uterine Cancer but in women with Hysterectomies, they do not have a Uterus so this is not an issue
3. Raloxifene: SERM Oestrogen agonist in bone (Inhibits bone resorption so effective for women at increased risk of Osteoporosis), antagonist in uterus (no increased risk of Uterine Cancer) and breast
4. Tibolone: prodrug metabolized to low potency oestrogen, progestogen and androgen to maintain low level, physiological Oestrogen and Androgen Signalling

### Adverse Effects

### Post-Menopausal/Older Women

1. Increased Risk of Breast Cancer
2. Increased risk of CVD
- Studies have been criticised due to formulation of HRT that was used and they mainly recruited postmenopausal women who underwent Menopause around 10 years ago

### Perimenopausal Women

1. Slightly reduced risk of CVD
2. Small Increase in Risk of Ovarian Cancer

---

# Anastrozole for Breast Cancer Prevention

- Anastrozole is an Aromatase inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of Breast Cancer and other Type in high risk post-menopausal women
- It does not change their risk of CVD or Bone Fractures (although it is was predicted to increase)

---

# Hormonal Cancer Treatment

### Breast Cancer

- Tamoxifen (SERM)
- Anastrozole → Preferable to Tamoxifen for Prevention

### Prostate Cancer

- GnRH Antagonist (Continuous Dosing, sometimes with an Anti-Androgen usually to prevent initial growth flair that occurs before GnRH Receptors are desensitised)
- GnRH Antagonist
