# Parkinson's Disease and Its Symptoms

- Cause of axon degeneration is unknown, but 70-80% of nigrostriatal neurons must be depleted before symptoms appear.
- This is result of existing neurons within the pathway compensating for lost neurons to minimise effects on motor function .
- It has been suggested that degeneration occurs due to age-related wear and tear of the Basal Ganglia Motor System as it is continuously active throughout life
- **MPTP** causes permanent symptoms of Parkinson‚Äôs disease by destroying dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra.
- Life events (e.g. head trauma, viral, environmental factors) may speed process of neuronal death and can trigger early onset Parkinson‚Äôs

## Symptoms

- Loss of Voluntary Motor Function
- Muscle rigidity: caused by locking-up of basal ganglia.
- Akinesia (loss of voluntary movement).
- Resting tremor: caused by disinhibition of cholinergic pathways, which would have been inhibited by dopamine.

### First Signs

- Soft monotonic speech.
- Swallowing problems
- Masked face (Limited range of emotional facial expressions)
- This is due to dysfunction to muscles of facial expression
- This is the opposite to the effects seen with Px who are taking Amphetamine as this raises DA Levels (Px often have loud, polytonic speech, excessive chewing and odd facial expressions)

### Later Stages

- Shuffling gait caused by rigidity.
- Stooped posture
- Freezing of posture during movement
- Executive dysfunction, regarding attention, impulse control, timely responses and response to cues.
- Depression, Anxiety and Sleep problems are often seen but likely as a consequence of reduced motion vs directly via Low Dopamine
- Px who develop Parkinson's are elderly and hence, loss of Dopaminergic Neurons is often coupled with loss of other neurons, leading to Dementia

# Dopamine Pathways

- Loss of dopamine neurones means that therapy is aimed at restoring function of dopamine transmission.
- ACh Neurons within the Striatum are usually inhibited by DA and when there is loss of these DA Neurons, this leads to Akinesia and Rigidity whilst Disinhibition of ACh Neuron firing leads to Resting Tremor
- Loss of dopamine inhibition on ACh neurones also means that muscarinic antagonists can be used to control resting tremor in Parkinson‚Äôs.
- Important to consider other dopamine pathways in CNS as dopamine replacement causes several side effects:
1. Nigrostriatal pathway (A9): motor pathway (fails in Parkinson‚Äôs)
2. Mesolimbic pathway (A10) to theNucleus Accumbens: reward pathways.
3. Mesocortical pathways (A10) to the Frontal Cortex: goes wrong in Schizophrenia to trigger psychosis.
4. Median eminence to anterior pituitary: DA usually inhibition of prolactin secretion.
5. Chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the Brainstem: vomiting centre (dopamine induces emesis).

# Central and Peripheral Side Effects

### Central

- Dyskinesia (uncontrolled movements due to High [DA]).
- Psychotic effects (Schizophrenia is treated with dopamine antagonists).
- ‚Üì in prolactin release.
- On-off effects: uncontrolled swings from akinesia to dyskinesia, usually occurring after several months of therapy and as dose of L- DOPA wears off due to fluctuating DA Levels.
- Result of complete degeneration of all neurons in substantia nigra.

### Peripheral

- Hypotension caused by displacement of noradrenaline from Vesicles by L-DOPA/DA at nerve terminals so ‚Üì sympathetic tone due to reduced NA Outflow.
- Nausea: dopamine can directly stimulate the CTZ as whilst it is in the brain stem, it lacks a blood brain barrier so DA from the Periphery (Often formed by L-DOPA Metabolism).
- Abnormal Compulsive Behaviours (Shopping, Gambling etc.) due to Increased stimulation of the Mesolimbic Pathway to the Nucleus Accumbens from the Ventral Tegmental Area that drives motivation and reward

# Synthesis and Breakdown

- Dopamine may be converted to NA (If the neuron expresses dopamine ùõΩ hydroxylase) to produce a Noradrenergic Neuron. If this enzyme is not expressed, the Neuron is Dopaminergic
- Neurotransmitters do not cross blood brain barrier (dopamine) but L-DOPA.
- If Central breakdown of DA is inhibited (via inhibition of COMT and MAO), dopamine levels ‚Üë.

![Screenshot 2021-12-09 at 10.26.30.png](%5BUMP2021%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%20c3cba3c74778435f967a901b1e6c00a2/Screenshot_2021-12-09_at_10.26.30.png)

- **Carbidopa**, **benserazide** inhibits DOPA decarboxylase in periphery to prevent L-DOPA being converted into DA within the Periphery that would prevent it from reaching the Brain and cause significant side effects.
- These cannot enter the Brain. Therefore, given as L-DOPA adjuncts to inhibit peripheral L-DOPA metabolism into Dopamine, so more L-
DOPA enters brain and converts to dopamine.
- This allows lower doses of L-DOPA to be given to produce a given pharmacological effect (reduces tolerance development) whilst also reducing Peripheral Dopaminergic Side effects by maximising the quantity of L-DOPA that reaches the brain, reducing the amount that stays in the periphery.
- Therefore, Px are often given Carbidopa and L-DOPA in a slow release form to minimise the number of tablets needed to be taken (In Elderly Px with potential cognitive impairments/poor memory, this reduces the likelihood of missed doses)
- **Selegiline** inhibits MAO-B.
- This can cross the BBB and enter the brain, protecting dopamine that is formed by inhibiting its metabolism.
- Sometimes used on its own in early stages of Parkinson‚Äôs/Early Onset Parkinsons to maintain endogenous Dopamine Levels, produced by Dopaminergic Neurons vs giving exogenous DA via L-DOPA which is more likely to cause side effects due to peripheral metabolism.
- **Entacapone** inhibits COMT, preventing breakdown of dopamine.
- **Domperidone** is a D2 receptor antagonist.
- It does not cross the BBB to enter the brain and hence, a large concentration reaches the CTZ as this is outside the BBB
- It has an anti-emetic effect by minimising Dopaminergic Stimulation of the CTZ.

# Therapy

- This is usually by increasing [DA] to maintain Dopaminergic Drive on the Basal Ganglia or Activating Receptors involved in the Basal Ganglia via Agonists
- As Parkinson's is characterised by low [DA], this could be coupled with raised Dopamine Receptor Expression, which can be targeted by Agonists to enhance their therapeutic effect/efficacy
- However, As drugs used to treat Parkinson's result in increased Dopamine Receptor, this can lead to stimulation of the 4 other Dopaminergic Pathways in the Brain, leading to widespread side effects
- Moreover, as DA is a precursor for NA, increasing [DA] to treat Parkinson's could increase [NA] and produce side effects
- Therefore, the main aim of Therapy for Parkinson's is making it tolerable with minimal side effects

### L-DOPA

- Therapy lasts for 2-10 years as it relies on having sufficient neurones left to take up L-DOPA and convert it into dopamine.
- L-DOPA does not prevent neuronal degeneration, it just maintains [DA] levels by increasing DA Production by existing neurons
- When 80% of neurones have degenerated, therapy stops working.
- Dopamine does not cross blood brain barrier, but L-DOPA can.
- It is converted to dopamine by DOPA-decarboxylase within the Brain.
- Akinesia and rigidity are improved more than tremor as Tremor is caused directly by NA not DA.
- L-DOPA usually works best in less elderly patients and produces improvements in movements over first 18 months.
- This is then maintained for 2-3 years, before gradual decline occurs, probably
as more and more dopamine neurones die.
- Larger doses (oral 100-500 mg day-1) are needed due to significantmetabolism in periphery, which means that only about 2% enters brain.
- **Hypotension**: L-DOPA converted to NA. Would expect hypertension, but hypotension occurs.
- L-DOPA displaces NA (so NA lost from neuron), therefore hypotension.
- Generally, no problem except for elderly patients as it can lead to postural hypotension and subsequent Syncope, which can cause  severe fracture.

### Dopamine Receptor Agonists

- These are predominantly used after L-DOPA Therapy becomes ineffective due to Significant degeneration of Dopaminergic Neurons and mimic the action of DA
- D1 and D2 are the main DA Receptors expressed in the body but D3, D4 and D5 Receptors have been cloned
- **Bromocriptine/pergolide**: D2 receptor agonist that mimics the action of DA within the Central Dopaminergic Pathways
- **Ropinirole**: D2 receptor agonist that mimics the action of Dopamine. It is sometimes used as Monotherapy in younger patients.
- **Apomorphine**: D1 and D2 agonist (Mainly used in Refractory Parkinson's that is not responsive to previous drugs).
- These agonists readily stimulate the CTZ (outside of brain). Must therefore be given in conjunction with **domperidone** (D2 receptor antagonist) to minimise anti-emetic effects.
- D5 is like D1, and D3 and D4 are like D2.

### Muscarinic Antagonists

- **Atropine**, **benzhexol** and **benztropine** are muscarinic antagonists and correct relative cholinergic excess that occurs because of dopamine deficiency.
- They are now used for drug induced Parkinson‚Äôs in Younger Vs Elderly (e.g. result of Schizophrenia drugs like D2 Antagonists which antagonise the Mesocortical DA Pathways but can affect the Nigrostrial Pathway too) as it produces Cognitive/Memory Defects (significantl in the elderly) as a common side effect via antagonism of other Noradrenergic Signalling Pathways important in Memory and Cognition.
- As Schizophrenia is often caused by Overactive Mesocortical DA Pathway whereas Parkinsons is caused by Underactive Nigrostrial Pathway, the treatment of one of these conditions can often exacerbate/cause the other.
- They reduce the Resting Tremor by blocking Noradrenergic Signalling in the Striatum that leads to the tremor and hence, it can be useful supplements to L-DOPA therapy.

### Amantadine

- Anti-Viral Drug that also acts as an NMDA antagonist (blocking glutamate stimulation in Motor Pathways).
- Some patients with Parkinson‚Äôs respond to this drug with little side effects (a drug blocking glutamate should have lots of side effects).

### Deep Brain Stimulation

- Rare, expensive, risky.
- Electrode placed through brain onto subthalamic area and electrically stimulate.
- It has been shown to be very effective in ome patients (who don‚Äôt respond to other therapies)

# Parkinson's Disease Algorithm

1. L-DOPA and Carbidopa (Dopa Decarboxylase Inhibitor) OR MAO-B Inhibitor
2. COMT Inhibitor OR MAO-B Inhibitor OR DA Agonist or Apomorphine (Dependent on Clinical Experience and Patient Preference)

# Other Motor Disorders

- **Huntington‚Äôs chorea**: inherited disorder has symptoms of uncontrolled movements resulting from loss of striatal neurones, especially GABA neurones which project back down to substantia nigra.
- This loss of inhibition results in a lack of inhibition of dopamine neurones (so too much movement) and can be partly controlled by D2 receptor antagonists (**tetrabenazine**) to block the effects of Increased Dopaminergic Drive from the Basal Ganglia.
- Treating dyskinesia without causing akinesia is very difficult as often by reducing DA Levels, you reduce them so low that Akinesia occurs.
- **Epilepsy**: hyper-excitability of brain mechanisms controlling movement.
- **Tics**: sudden stereotyped movements are of unknown origins but respond to dopamine antagonists.
- **Tourette‚Äôs syndrome**: also involves vocal tics.
- Uncontrolled motor output to speech centres. Dopamine antagonist (**haloperidol**) and perhaps Pimozide
- **Restless legs**: older people whose legs keep moving (especially at night).
- **Ropinirole** (agonist) is used to manage this and whilst theoretically, as a Dopamine Agonist it should stimulate movement, it may act to desensitise DA Receptors to reduce the stimulatory effects of Increased DA.
