# [UMP2036] Pharmacological Basis of Treatment of Inflammation

# Problems In Treatment Inflammatory Disease

- Normal inflammation (pathophysiological): protective and robust and eventually, self limiting.
- Dysfunctional inflammation (pathological): protective, destructive
and persistent.
- The Inflammatory system shows synergy between the activity of various mediators but also redundancy whereby one mediators can take over the role of another if it is absent/defective
- This means that regulation of Inflammatory Systems can be difficult as multiple mediators may have to be inhibited to produce a significant anti-inflammatory effect but the inhibition of multiple mediators can cause immunosuppression/suppress the physiological inflammatory response
- Within body, physiological inflammation is a balance between:
1. Drivers of inflammation: pro inflammatory molecules.
2. Controllers: found within cell, inhibitors of cascade pathways, inhibit cytokine production, release of glucocorticoids (cortisol) ‚Üí These suppress and regulate the inflammatory response.
- This allows the Inflammatory System to be regulated (quick and responsive yet limited)

# Hans Selye and General Adaptation Syndrome

- Inflammatory Stressors (E.g Trauma and Infection) triggers the release of Pro-Inflammatory Mediators and the Hypothalamus via an unknown mechanism to active the HPA Axis to increase the synthesis of Glucocorticoids like Cortisol
- Cortisol acts to suppress the activity of pro-inflammatory mediators in order to suppress the release of proinflammatory mediators and fine tune/regulate the inflammatory response
- This led to the identification that the physiological function of stress-induced increased Glucocorticoid Levels is to protect against potential damage/homeostatic disruption due to Pro-Inflammatory Mediators causing excessive inflammation

---

# HPA Axis

- HPA axis: hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, adrenal cortex.
- In response to stress, hypothalamus releases CRF, which acts on anterior pituitary to release ACTH, which acts on adrenal cortex to release mineralocorticoids (e.g. aldosterone) and glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol).
- Feedback mechanism: released glucocorticoids inhibit hypothalamus and anterior pituitary.
- Addison‚Äôs disease: dysfunction in HPA axis.

# Steroid Synthesis

- Corticosteroids (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids) are derived from cholesterol.
- Cortisol is more potent than cortisone at the GR and hence, is more important in inflammatory regulation.
- HSD (11ùõΩ-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase):
1. Type I: converts cortisone to cortisol.
2. Type II: converts cortisol to cortisone.

![Screenshot 2022-02-07 at 09.14.11.png](%5BUMP2036%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20Treatment%20of%20In%20aa787e4ca6724d2eb5b2401cc3eda604/Screenshot_2022-02-07_at_09.14.11.png)

- Following its release, cortisol can interact with various peripheral cells (E.g Cardiovascular System, Peripheral Nerves, Liver, Adipose Tissue), which likely gives rises to the side effects associated with Glucocorticoid usage

---

# Glucorticoid Receptor Pathway and Actions

- Glucocorticoids are nuclear receptor ligands.
- Cortisol is produced and transfuses through membrane (lipid molecule) where it binds to glucocorticoid receptor, which is found in an inactive state in cytoplasm (bound to chaperone molecules such as heat shock protein 90).
- Upon binding of cortisol to the GR, chaperone molecules dissociate, leaving the unbound glucocorticoid receptor, allowing it to dimerise
- Dissociation of HSP90 reveals various binding motifs (Ligand, Nuclear and Transcription Factor Binding Regions) on the receptor (translocation motifs allow dimerised receptor to translocate to nucleus; DNA binding motifs allow binding to glucocorticoid regulatory elements found upstream of various genes).
- Once glucocorticoid receptor enters nucleus, causes upregulation/downregulation of gene transcription.
- This is done directly (binding to glucocorticoid regulatory element) or binding with other transcription factors.
- Approximately 2,000 genes are affected.

### Mechanism of Action

- There are 3 proposed mechanisms of action of activated GRs:
1. Direct - GR Dimers can directly with GREs directly in the DNA to upregulate or downregulate Gene Transcription
2. Tethering - GR directly interact with Transcription Factors, where the GR Dimer upregulates gene transcription and the GR monomer downregulates gene transcription (notably pro-inflammatory genes)
3. Composite - GR Dimers bind to GREs to regulate the activity of adjacent transcription factors that allow for the transcription of adjacent genetic elements

# Genes Regulated by Glucocorticoids

| Downregulated: Glucocorticoid inhibited proteins with potential
pro-inflammatory activity | Upregulated: Glucocorticoidinduced proteins with potential anti-inflammatory activity |
| --- | --- |
| Chemokine receptors CCR1 and
CCR2 | Anx-A1 (Annexin A1/lipocortin
I). Phospholipase A2 inhibitor (initial conversion of membrane lipid to arachidonic acid) |
| Complement components C1q, C3
and C5 | ùõΩ2 adrenergic receptor |
| Complement receptors C3aR1,
CR2 and C5aR1 | Clara cell protein |
| IL-1 Receptor-I | GILZ |
| IL-8 Receptor | HbSR CD163 |
| Interferon-ùú∏ receptor I and II. Associated with viral infections. | IùúÖB - Natural inhibitor of NFùúÖB, which is important transcription factor in inflammation. |
| Macrophage migration inhibitory
factor | IL-10 - Anti-inflammatory cytokine. |
| Matrix metalloproteinases 7, 10, 16, 19 Enzyme breaking down tissue | IL-10 receptor |
| Thrombospondins 1, 2, 4 | IL-1 receptor-2 (IL-1 decoy receptor). Decoy receptor. IL-1 is Pro-inflammatory, so binds to IL-1 receptor-2 so doesn‚Äôt signal. |
| Tumour necrosis factor receptor
family members (including GITR) | MPK-1  |
| Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 Pattern recognition receptor. One of first receptors activated in inflammatory response. | Transforming growth factor - ùõΩ3 |
| COX-2 Produces pro-inflammatory
prostaglandins |  |
| IL-2 - Important in T-cell proliferation. |  |
- Generally, Glucocorticoids downregulate pro-inflammatory mediators (Pro-Inflammatory Chemokines and their receptors, Complement Molecules, Anaphylatoxin Receptors, COX-2) and upregulate anti-inflammatory mediators (Eicosanoids, Inhibitors of Proinflammatory Transcription Factors, Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines)

---

# Overall Effect of Glucocorticoids

- ‚Üì migration of neutrophils.
- ‚Üì activation of neutrophils and macrophages.
- ‚Üì activation of T-lymphocytes and clonal expansion.
- ‚Üì fibroblast activation, matrix deposition.
- ‚Üì osteoblast activation (causing osteoporosis).
- Steroid rosacea: glucocorticoid use causing flare up of skin

---

# Anti-Inflammatory Steroids (SAIDs)

- Example: cortisol, dexamethasone, betamethasone, prednisolone, prednisone ‚Üí These are all Cortisol derivatives and are some of the most powerful anti-inflammatory drugs

| Drugs | Relative Affinity for GR | Relative Anti-Inflammation | Relative Na‚Å∫ Retention (Side-Effect) | Duration of Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cortisol | 1 | 1 | 1 | Short |
| Prednisolone | 2.2 | 4 | 0.8 | Intermediate |
| Prednisone | 0.05 | 4 | 0.8 | Intermediate |
| Dexamethosone | 7.1 | 30 | Minimal | Long |
| Betamethasone | 5.4 | 30 | Negligible | Long |
- To make cortisol better, ‚Üë potency and ‚Üì side-effects (E.g Increased GR Affinity and Reduced MR Affinity to reduce Sodium Retention), ‚Üë mode of action via chemical modifications.
- Dexamethasone and betamethasone are potent SAIDs, with a long duration of action.
- Duration of action of SAIDs depends on:
1. Fraction bound to plasma proteins.
2. Affinity for 11ùõΩ-HSDII (High Affinity = Rapid Inactivation = Short Duration).
3. Lipophilicity
4. Affinity for GR

---

# Side-Effects of Glucocorticoid Treatment

- In order to produce their potency to overcome the Synergy and Redundancy of the Inflammatory System, Glucocorticoids affect the transcription of a wide range of molecules
- Whilst this produces a very potent effect, it also produces side effects

### Cushing‚Äôs Syndrome

- Due to giving patient high levels of glucocorticoids.
- Occurs in 2-3 weeks.
- Symptoms: re-distribution of fat from limbs to waist and buffalo hump; thinning of skin; hypertension; poor wound-healing; easy bruising; osteoporosis; major metabolic effects; psychological
psychotic effects.

![Screenshot 2022-02-07 at 09.32.31.png](%5BUMP2036%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20Treatment%20of%20In%20aa787e4ca6724d2eb5b2401cc3eda604/Screenshot_2022-02-07_at_09.32.31.png)

### Other Side-Effect

- Corticosteroid-induced peptic ulceration: prostaglandins have protective role in gut, so inhibition of Physiological Prostaglandin Synthesis in the Stomach can lead to ulceration.
- Corticosteroid-induced glaucoma which increases increased cupping/neurodegeneration within the retina
- Osteoporosis due to inhibition of OBs

### Inhibition of Endogenous Glucocorticoid Production

### Treatment of Side Effect

- Patient given dosage to treat pathology.
- Exogenous glucocorticoids ‚Üì endogenous glucocorticoid levels in an attempt to keep circulating glucocorticoid levels constant.
- Sustained exogenous glucocorticoid levels will inhibit adrenal cortex
production of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids via Inhibition of CRF and ACTH Release, causing adrenal cortex to atrophy.
- This is not a problem when patient
continues to receive exogenous glucocorticoids as Glucocorticoid Signalling is maintained at normal levels
- However, steroid treatment cannot just be stopped.
- Dosage is then tapered back to minimal dosage required to inhibit pathology (can take up to 1 year).
- This is because sudden removal of Glucocorticoids would cause Glucocorticoid Levels to drop significantly as the atrophied adrenal cortex is not of sufficient size to increase endogenous Glucocorticoid Synthesis back to normal levels, causing Px to enter Adrenal Crisis

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 18.31.53.png](%5BUMP2036%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20Treatment%20of%20In%20aa787e4ca6724d2eb5b2401cc3eda604/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_18.31.53.png)

---

# Adrenal Crisis

- Severe Acute Condition that requires immediate medical attention:
1. Pain in legs, abdomen and lower back
2. Psychosis and Confusions
3. Fever and Convulsions
4. Hyperkalaemia, Hypercalcaemia, Hypoglycaemia and Hyponatraemia
5. Hypotension
- Rx = Glucocorticoid Therapy to raise Glucocorticoid Levels back to normal levels

---

# Glucocorticoid Withdrawal Syndrome (GWS)

- Psychological dependence can develop following GC Usage, so therefore, removal of these drugs can cause Psychological Issues
- Following removal of Glucocorticoids, the Disease that was being Rx by the Glucocorticoids can flair up/relapse, often at a greater intensity than that seen before GC Therapy (E.g Asthma and Rheumatoid Arthritis)
- HPA axis suppression which can persist for a long time.
- Non-specific withdrawal syndrome despite normal HPA axis function can occur while patients are receiving physiological replacement doses of GCs.
- Therefore, to prevent GWS and Adrenal Crises due to Adrenal Atrophy, Px are slowly withdrawn from GCs over a period of months to minimise withdrawal effects and allow for sufficient regeneration of the Adrenal Cortex to restore normal endogenous Corticosteroid Synthesis

---

# Routes of Glucocorticoids Administration

- Inhaled glucocorticoids (20% lung 80% oral ‚Üí Used in Asthma): ‚Üë airway mucosa bioavailability whilst ‚Üì oral bioavailability.
- Cutaneous glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone): can thin skin.
- Depot glucocorticoids (Injection of GCs into the site of Pathology/Where inflammation is found)
- Pregnancy glucocorticoids: Prednisone (inactive precursor of Prednisolone) can be converted to Prednisolone via 11Œ≤HSD-I. However, when it crosses the placenta, it is inactivated to Prednisone via 11Œ≤HSD-II to prevent damage to the Foetus due to excess GC Signalling
- Dexamethasone is HSD2 insensitive and hence, cannot be inactivated as it crosses the placenta, meaning it can damage the foetus and be teratogenic.

---

# Dose Tapering

- This can be used to established a therapeutic dose of GCs whilst minimising side effects (E.g Adrenal Cortex Atrophy and Cushing‚Äôs Syndrome)
- Initially, Px is given a Standard Dose which will definitely manage their disease
- Then the dose is slowly reduced to the minimum dose at which the therapeutic effect of the GC on the management of Sx is still seen

![Screenshot 2022-02-07 at 09.45.48.png](%5BUMP2036%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20Treatment%20of%20In%20aa787e4ca6724d2eb5b2401cc3eda604/Screenshot_2022-02-07_at_09.45.48.png)

- Dose Tapering can also be done to alter the route of administration of the GC or when adding new therapies/medications to a Px Rx Regime OR when stopping GC Therapy due to resolution of Px‚Äôs Disease or the occurrence of a new condition which is exacerbated by GC Therapy

---

# Biologics

- Biomolecules used to target inflammatory mediators (e.g. antibodies, cytokines).
- Most traditional medicines are SMEs (Small Molecular Entities) whereas Biologics have a high Mr and are comprised usually of Proteins/Amino Acids
- Their increased size and complexity allows Biologics to have multiple binding sites and can elicit multiple functions but are provides them with high target specificity
- Specificity for molecular targets allows them to have a greater potential of targeting underlying pathology rather than just Sx, allowing them to be more effective
- Due to their high selectivity, the side effects of biologics are often due to On Target effects (effects on the same molecular target, possibly expressed in a different unaffected tissue) vs Off Target Effects (effects on different targets)
- Cons: High Specificity means that redundancy can limit their effectiveness, high development cost, only given via injection as they are proteins, foreign protein causes an immune reaction (antibodies against therapeutic).

### Differences

| Property | SME | Biologics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Size | Small | Large |
| Stability | Stable | Heat Sensitive/Labile |
| Ability to Stimulate Immune Responses | Non-Immunogenic | Immunogenic (As they are proteins) |
| Species Selectivity | Species Independent Activity | Species Dependent Activity |
| Oral Activity | Orally Active | Orally Inactive |
| Duration of Action | Short Acting | Long Lasting |
| Administration | Usually Px Administered | May required Administration by Medical Staff |

---

# Therapeutic Actions of Biologics

- 3 Classes:
1. Signalling Molecule Analogues (E.g Insulin)
2. Gene Expression Modulators
3. Therapeutic Antibodies

### Therapeutic Antibodies

- Majority of Therapeutic Abs used in Inflammation are Ligand Antagonists that prevent the activity of the Proinflammatory Mediators on their receptors
- Some can stimulate receptors to active Anti-Inflammatory Signalling Cascades
- Some Abs are Cytotoxic can stimulate ADCC (Antibody Dependence Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity) or Complement Mediated Cytotoxic Events to destroy Cells involved in Inflammation
- Cytotoxic Abs are associated with Rx of Cancer
- Therapeutic Abs can be linked to toxins that are targeted towards Cell Surface Receptors ‚Üí Mainly for use in Cancer

![Screenshot 2022-02-07 at 10.06.01.png](%5BUMP2036%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20Treatment%20of%20In%20aa787e4ca6724d2eb5b2401cc3eda604/Screenshot_2022-02-07_at_10.06.01.png)

### Immunisation of mAbs

- When a Protein is injected into a Px, the protein is often processed by APCs where it can trigger an inflammatory response ‚Üí This can be prevented by Humanising the Ab by using Human Fc and Fab regions
- The Degree at which an mAb has been humanised and hence, its risk of Immunogenicity (Stimulating an Immune Response) is reflected by the suffix of the mAB
- From Low to High Humanisation (High to Low Risk of Immunogenicity) = -omab ‚Üí -ximab ‚Üí -zumab ‚Üí -umab
- mAb with the Suffix -iximab is a Chimeric mAb made with a Human Fc region and a Fab Region from another species (Often Mouse)
- mAb ending in -umab are fully humanised, with Human Fc and Fab Regions

---

# Cytokines and Chemokines (Cellular Effects)

- These are simple polypeptides or glycoproteins with a Mr < 30 kD
- Constitutive/constant production of Cytokines is uncommon in the physiological state, with their production being regulated, often at the transcriptional and translational level
- Cytokine production is usually transient, stimulating cells in the nearby vicinity
- They act by binding with very high affinity to cell surface receptors (Very Low Kd)
- Most of the effects produced by cytokines are due to altered gene expression in the target
- These often produce their effects on the Innate Immune System, Specific Immune Response, Growth Factors or Inhibitory Cytokines
- Cytokines are often Pleiotropic in Activity, with one cytokine producing multiple different effects, often by being present in multiple different forms

---

# Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF)

### Activity

- Induces fever
- Stimulates phase protein release.
- Cytotoxic/cytostatic for cells.
- Activates granulocytes and macrophages.
- Promotes bone resorption by osteoclasts.
- Inhibits collagen synthesis and promotes breakdown.
- Induces cytokine synthesis.
- Promotes fibroblast proliferation.
- ‚Üë metabolic activity of muscle
- Activates endothelial cells.
- Promotes angiogenesis
- ‚Üë lipolysis and ‚Üì lipid synthesis.
- It has been shown to be the key cytokine in pathologies like RA

### Rheumatoid Arthritis

- This is the most common autoimmune disease with a prevalence of around 0.5-1% and a F:M Ratio of 3:1
- Regarding Long Term Prognosis without Rx:
1. 70% of Px have radiographic damage within the first 3 years of the onset of the disease
2. Damage progresses throughout the Px‚Äôs Lifetime
3. 80% of Px are disabled after 20 years
4. Life Expectancy is reduced by 3-18 years

### Anti-TNFŒ±

- Infliximab: Mouse-Human chimeric mAb. Antibodies against infliximab can be produced by body which lead to the breakdown of the mAb and hence, ‚Üì its effectiveness
- Adalimumab: Fully humanised mAb

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 18.38.24.png](%5BUMP2036%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20Treatment%20of%20In%20aa787e4ca6724d2eb5b2401cc3eda604/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_18.38.24.png)

- Etanercept - Fusion Protein that contain the Human Fc Region but the TNF Receptor instead of an Fab ‚Üí This allows the mAb to bind to TNF-Œ± to prevent it from stimulating its receptor and producing effects

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 18.39.04.png](%5BUMP2036%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20Treatment%20of%20In%20aa787e4ca6724d2eb5b2401cc3eda604/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_18.39.04.png)

- These are used as Rx in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn‚Äôs Disease

### Some (Rare) Safety Issues with TNFŒ± mAbs

1. Serious Infection
2. Opportunistic Infections (E.g TB ‚Üí Px should be screened for Latent TB before administration to prevent reactivation of infection)
3. Malignancies
4. Demyelination
5. Haematological Abnormalities
6. Administration Reactions
7. Congestive Heart Failure
8. Autoantibodies and Lupus-Like Syndrome

### Other Anti-Inflammatory Biologics

- Abatacept and Rituximab (Vs CD20) ‚Üí Rheumatoid Arthritis
- Tocilizumab (vs IL-6) ‚Üí Various Arthritic Conditions
- Ustekinumab (Vs IL-12/23) ‚Üí Psoriasis

# Limitations and Challenges of Monoclonal Antibody Therapy

1. As they are proteins, they currently only target extracellular targets (as they cannot enter the cell) and have poor bioavailability (only administered via Injection)
2. Translation from results in In Vivo Models to clinical trials can not always be congruent
3. They are expensive 
4. They require a thorough understanding of the Pathophysiology of a disease and correct target identification and stratification of Px
5. Poor Management of On Target Side Effects (E.g Melanoma Rx with mAb causes Acute and Chronic Inflammation)

---

# Immunosuppressive Drug

- Act directly on T Cells to inhibit their activation and proliferation
- Activation of TCR causes rise in Intracellular [Ca¬≤‚Å∫], signalling to Calcineurin to activate mFAT via Dephosphorylation, allowing it to enter the nucleus and act as a TF Factor to upregulate genes involved in T Cell Activation
- Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus inhibit the actions of Calcineurin here to prevent T Cell Activation ‚Üí Mainly used to prevent Transplant Rejection
