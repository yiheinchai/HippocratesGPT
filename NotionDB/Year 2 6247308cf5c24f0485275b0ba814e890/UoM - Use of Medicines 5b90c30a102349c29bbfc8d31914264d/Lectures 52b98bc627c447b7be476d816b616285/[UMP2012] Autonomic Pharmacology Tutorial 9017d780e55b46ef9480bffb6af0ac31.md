# [UMP2012] Autonomic Pharmacology Tutorial

# mAChR Agonists

- ACh
- Muscarine
- Carbachol
- Methacholine
- Pilocarpine

Uses

1. Glaucoma - Reduce Aqueous Humour Synthesis, and improve Drainage via Canal of Schlemm (Opens in Miosis)
2. Dry Mouth
3. Paralyic Ileus
4. Urinary or Bowel Atonia

---

# Mechanism of Muscarinic Signalling

- M1,3,5 = Gq → Stimulate PLC, Increases [IP3] and [DAG], Increases intracellular [Ca2+] which stimulates PKC
- M2,4 = Gi → Inhibit AC, Lowers [cAMP], Inhibits PKA

---

# nAChRs

- Ganglion nAChR only has alpha and beta subunits

---

# Muscarinic Antagonists

1. Atropine (Increased IOP and Mydriasis)
2. Tiotropium
3. Ipratropium 
4. Hyoscine

Uses

- Used in Intubation to reduce Bronchial Secretions to allow for easier access to the Airways
- Asthma and COPD - M3 in the Lung causes Bronchoconstriction and stimulates secretions
- Cystic Fibrosis - Reduce Secretions
- Rx Bradycardia
- IBS - Reduce Bowel Movement and Bowel Secretions
- Urinary Incontinence or Overactive Bladder - Increases contraction of the Internal Urinary Sphincter
- Anticholinesterase Poisonining - Novichok (Prevent action of Excess ACh on mAChR which causes Pronounced Bradycardia)
- Parkinson's = In the Substantia Nigra, Cholinergic Interneurons are found which stimulate mAChRs to reduce inhibition of Motor Neurons, producing overactivity.
- ACh toxicity seems to stimulate PSNS more than SNS as in PSNS It stimulates Ganglia and mAChR vs just Ganglia for SNS

# Sympatheticomimetic/SNS Drugs

- Dobutamine
- Adrenaline/Noradrenaline (Mainly Both and then Alpha only)
- Phenylephrine
- Isoprenaline (Mainly Beta)
- Clonidine (Alpha

Uses:

- Local Anaesthesia Injection - Increases Duration
- Asthma - Bronchodilation (Salbutamol)
- Anaphylaxis
- Heart Failure/Cardiac Shock (Dobutamine)

### Antagonists

Uses:

- Arrhythmias - Propanolol
- Anxiety - Propanolol (Atenolol is Beta-1 Specific)
- Antihypertensives - Carvedilol
- Heart Failure - Carvedilol
- Glaucoma - Timolol
- Angina
- Phaeochromocytoma
