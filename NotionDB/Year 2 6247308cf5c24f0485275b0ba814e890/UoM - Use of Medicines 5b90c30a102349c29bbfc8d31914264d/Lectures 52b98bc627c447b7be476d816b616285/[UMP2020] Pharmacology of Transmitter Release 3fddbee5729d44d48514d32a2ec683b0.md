# Drug Targets

- In CNS, obvious targets for drug action are neurotransmitter receptors on postsynaptic cell.
- In simplest scenario you might:
1. Mimic activity of a neurotransmitter with an agonist.
2. Block activity of a neurotransmitter with an antagonist

---

# Receptors as Drug Targets

### Ligand Gated Ion Channels

- Fast’ neurotransmitters operate through ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs), causing ion fluxes leading to changes in membrane potential.
- Glutamate: depolarising, excitatory.
- GABA: hyperpolarising, inhibitory.

### G-Protein Coupled Receptor

- ‘Slow’ neurotransmitters operate via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs).
- Affecting separate ion channels or enzymes via second messengers.
1. Adenylate cyclase: produces cyclic AMP.
2. Phospholipase C: inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol (IP3 and DAG).
3. Phospholipase A2: arachidonic acid.
4. Phosphodiesterase: hydrolyses cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP.
- Examples: dopamine, neuropeptides.

### Examples

**Ondansetron**

- 5-HT₃ Receptor antagonist.
- Antiemetic in postoperative, radiation, or cytotoxic drug-induced nausea/vomiting.

**Memantine**

- Non-competitive NMDA-R antagonist.
- Alzheimer’s disease

**Perampanel**

- Non-competitive AMPA-R antagonist.
- Epilepsy

**Rotigotine**

- Dopamine D3 receptor agonist.
- Parkinson’s disease

**Sulpiride**

- Dopamine D2 receptor antagonist
- Schizophrenia

# Pre vs Postsynaptic Modulation

- Many drugs are neither agonists nor antagonists
- They interact with the receptor to modulate its function - increasing or decreasing the response to the neurotransmitter
- They act at site that are distinct from those that bind neurotransmitters (or Agonists and Antagonists) and hence, are classed as Allosteric Modulators
- Neurotransmitters ca also be modified via intracellular secondary messengers that can act to change receptors (e.g Phosphorylating Receptors)
- Presynaptic modulation: leads to a change in amount of
neurotransmitter released.
- Postsynaptic modulation: leads directly to a change in behaviour
of postsynaptic neuron.

# Modulation of Postsynaptic Neurotransmitter Receptors

- Benzodiazepines (Diazepam) - Used in premedication/anxiety/status epilepticus.
- Benzodiazepines increase GABA-A receptor affinity, therefore increase the activity of GABA at these receptors and the inhibition produced by GABA.
- There are many modulators of GABA-A receptors. GABA binds to active site, and everything else binds to allosteric site.
- The GABA-A Receptor has a GABA Site, Barbiturate Site, Steroid Site, Benzodiazepine Site, Anaesthetic Site (IV and Inhaled) and Picrotoxin Site moving clockwise around the receptor

---

# Presynaptic Modulation - Neurotransmitter Synthesis

- Drugs that affect synthesis of a neurotransmitter may lead to a change in amount of neurotransmitter produced, released during neurotransmission and therefore effectiveness of neurotransmission.
- This type of modulation can occur by:
1. By modifying enzyme activity.
2. By altering precursor availability.

### Altering Precursor Availability

- In Parkinsonism, degeneration of nigrostriatal tract causes loss of striatal dopamine (DA) from the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta to the Corpus Striatum.
- DA does not cross blood-brain barrier, so it cannot be administered to affect the brain.
- L-DOPA is immediate precursor of DA and when it enters brain (crosses the BBB), is decarboxylated to DA by AADC/Aromatic L-amino Decarboxylase (Dopamine Decarboxylase)
- Levodopa = L-DOPA (L dihydroxyphenylalanine)
- When administering L-DOPA, there are enzymes that will break down L-DOPA in the Periphery
- COMT/Catechol-O-methyltransferase converts L-DOPA into 3-Methoxydopa
1. L-DOPA (DDC and COMT). therefore, give drugs to inhibit these enzymes:
- Inhibit DDC: carbidopa, benserazide
- Inhibit COMT: entacapone, tolcapone
1. There are also enzymes that can break down Dopamine within the Brain (MAO-B and COMT)
- MAO-B breaks down Dopamine into DOPAC/Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid and COMT breaks down Dopamine into 3-Methoxytyrosine
- Inhibit MAO-B: selegiline, rasagiline
- Inhibit COMT: tolcapone
- Therefore, these drugs are given to inhibit these enzymes to maximise [Dopamine]:

### Modifying Enzyme Activity

**Metirosine (**𝛼-methyl-𝑝-tyrosine)

- Competitive antagonist of tyrosine binding site on Tyrosine Hydroxylase.
- Blocks production of all catecholamines by preventing formation of L-Dopa from Tyrosine.
- Used rarely, in cases of phaeochromocytoma

# Presynaptic Modulation - Neurotransmitter Storage In Vesicles

- Classical, small molecule neurotransmitters accumulate and are transported into vesicles via specific carriers that use a H⁺-ATPase to pump H⁺ into the Vesicle.
- This high Intravesicular [H⁺] is used by a Cotransporter that mediates Vesicle influx via H⁺ Efflux
- Vesicular Monoamine Transporters (VMAT) transport, NA, A, DA, 5-HT and Histamine
- Vesicular ACh Transporters (VAChT) transport ACh
- Vesicular GABA Transporter (VGAT/VIAAT) transport GABA and Glycine
- Vesicular Glutamate Transporters (VGLUTs) transport Glutamine
- Peptide neurotransmitters are manufactured and transported in vesicles from soma (cell body) to terminal.

### Vesicular Transport

- These transporters define neural phenotype, as it requires transporter for release.

# Effects of Vesicular Storage (and Non-Vesicular Release)

**Tetrabenazine**

- Blocks VMAT, ↓ vesicular DA storage.
- Treatment of chorea in Huntington’s disease.

**Amphetamine**

- Taken up into vesicles by VMAT and displace endogenous monoamines
from vesicles into cytoplasm.
- This stimulates DA and NA release by promoting reversal of uptake carrier so that it mediates monoamine efflux (and inhibits uptake).

**MDMA (3,4-Methylene-Dioxymethamphetamine/Ectasy)**

- Transported by SERT and stimulates release of 5-HT and inhibits its re-uptake.

# Role of Ca²⁺

### Key Role

- Ca²⁺ is required for vesicular release process:
- Removal of Ca²⁺ blocks transmission.
- Replacing Ca²⁺ with other divalent ions that permeate Ca²⁺ channels (Ba²⁺ or Sr²⁺) support transmission.
- Replacing Ca²⁺ with Divalent Ions that don’t permeate (Co²⁺ or Mn²⁺) Ca²⁺ Channels block transmission.
- Specific Ca²⁺ channels are involved in transmission in different neurons:
- N and P-type Ca²⁺ channel antagonists (𝛀-conotoxin and 𝛀-agatoxin IVA) prevent Ca²⁺ influx and block neurotransmitter release at many synapses.
- Anything that affects Ca²⁺ entry can influence transmitter release.

### Neurotransmitter Release

- Ca²⁺ acts as intracellular messenger, linking presynaptic depolarisation to neurosecretion.

### In 'Fast' Synapses

- Enters through clusters of channels near docked synaptic vesicles (active zones).
- Rapidly (200 𝜇s), [Ca²⁺] reaches > 100 𝜇M within this micro-domain (10s of nm).
- Binds with low affinity to vesicular proteins (synaptotagmins) causing them to interact with phospholipids and SNARE proteins to trigger nanomechanical action of the membrane fusion machinery to enable neurotransmitter release

![Screenshot 2021-12-02 at 09.58.39.png](%5BUMP2020%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Transmitter%20Release%203fddbee5729d44d48514d32a2ec683b0/Screenshot_2021-12-02_at_09.58.39.png)

### In 'Slow' Synapses (Releasing Peptides)

- Vesicles are larger (large dense core vesicles).
- In the Presynaptic Nerve Terminal, they are not concentrated at active zones.
- Neurotransmitters Release requires Ca²⁺ but usually needs repetitive pre-synaptic action potentials.
- Ca²⁺-dependent event is movement of vesicle to membrane.
- Bulk Ca²⁺ levels in low 𝜇M range needed for synaptic release to occur, suggesting a higher affinity vesicular proteins for Ca²⁺ to trigger release.

---

# Modulation of Transmitter Release

- Presynaptic GPCRs regulate transmission.
- Activation of GPCRs located at presynaptic terminal can reduce the probability of neurotransmitter release.
- This presynaptic depression involves activation of Gi/o-type G- proteins that mediate different inhibitory mechanisms, including:
1. Inhibition of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, inhibiting Ca²⁺ entry.
2. Activation of K⁺ channels (Hyperpolarises the membrane to prevent Voltage-Gated Ca²⁺ Channels from opening).
3. Direct inhibition of vesicle fusion process

### Modulation of Ca²⁺ Channels Affect Release

- Ca²⁺ channels can be regulated by neurotransmitters, acting on metabotropic receptors.
- Activation of receptor leads to activation of a G-protein that inhibits
Ca²⁺ channel.
- Such receptors may be:
- Autoreceptors: receptor activated by a neurotransmitter to inhibit its own release.
- Heteroreceptors: receptor activated by a neurotransmitter released from a different cell.

# Cannabinoid Modulation of Transmitter Release

- Cannabinoid receptors are GPCRs.
- Common Exogenous Cannabinoid = ∆9-THC and Common Endogenous Cannabinoids = Anandamide and 2-Arachidonoyl Glycerol (2-AG) - These have similar actions
- Cannabinoid receptors interact mainly with Gi/o-type G proteins,
activating a signalling pathway that:
1. Inhibit voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels.
2. Activate K⁺ channels.
3. Activate kinases such as mitogen activated pathway kinase (MAP kinase) altering gene expression.
- ∆9-THC. Anadamide and 2-AG act on CB1 receptor in brain (CB2 Receptors are found in the Periphery).
- In hippocampus, CB1 receptors inhibit voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, reducing neurotransmitter release in the Hippocampus.
- CB1 is expressed on Glutamatergic and GABAergic Synapses (as well as others) and so, the specific effects of Cannabinoids depends on the neuron being stimulated
- Therefore, CB1 activation reduces inhibitory or excitatory transmission depending on synapse.

![Screenshot 2021-12-02 at 10.08.27.png](%5BUMP2020%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Transmitter%20Release%203fddbee5729d44d48514d32a2ec683b0/Screenshot_2021-12-02_at_10.08.27.png)

1. Depolarisation of the Postsynaptic Membrane induces Postsynaptic Production of Endocannabinoid 2-AG or Anandamide
2. This is via the Activation of DAG Lipase that converts DAG (Diacylglycerol) into 2-AG
3. Lipophilic Endocannabinoids cross the Postsynaptic Membrane to enter the Synaptic Cleft via Facilitated Diffusion
4. Endocannabinoids then stimulate CB1 Receptors, which inhibits the AP Inducing Transmitter release by inhibiting Ca²⁺  Channels
- Retrograde endocannabinoid modulation of the Presynaptic Membrane is implicated in:
- Short-term suppression of excitatory or inhibitory transmission is induced by postsynaptic depolarisation or activation of postsynaptic GPCRs.
- Long-term synaptic depression (LTD) that involves a long-lasting ↓ in neurotransmitter release.

# Presynaptic Modulation - Neurotransmitter Uptake and Release

### Direct Effects of Vesicle Release

- Levetiracetam and Brivaracetam are anti-epiletics which bind to Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2A (SV2A) to inhibit synaptic transmission, reducing the amplitude of Postsynaptic Currents generated during Synaptic Release

### Neurotransmitter Uptake

- Once released, neurotransmitter diffuses across synaptic cleft and may interact with postsynaptic receptors.
- Neurotransmitter is then recovered by uptake into presynaptic cells or glial cells (usually the case for small molecule transmitters).
- This Neurotransmitter Uptake is mediated by a Cotransporter that couples Neurotransmitter Influx with Na⁺ Influx
- Blockade of transporters can extend time neurotransmitter is present in synapse and thus enhance its action (both duration and area over which it is active).

# Presynaptic Modulation - Metabolism of Neurotransmitters

- Blocking transmitter breakdown can increase its action.
- In case of ACh and peptides, enzymes that degrade these molecules are extracellular whereas enzymes that degrade other small molecule neurotransmitters are usually found within the Nerve Terminal and Glia.
- However, for most neurotransmitters, breakdown occurs following re-uptake and is carried out by intracellular enzymes in neurons or glia.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Moclobemide | Manetrix | Monoamine Oxidase A (MAO-A) | Noradrenaline | Major Depression |
| Selegiline | Eldepryl | Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B) | Dopamine | Parkinson's Disease |
| Valproate | Epilim | GABA Transaminase (GABA-T) and SSADH | GABA | Epilepsy |
| Vigabatrin | Sabril | GABA Transaminase (GABA-T) | GABA | Epilepsy |
