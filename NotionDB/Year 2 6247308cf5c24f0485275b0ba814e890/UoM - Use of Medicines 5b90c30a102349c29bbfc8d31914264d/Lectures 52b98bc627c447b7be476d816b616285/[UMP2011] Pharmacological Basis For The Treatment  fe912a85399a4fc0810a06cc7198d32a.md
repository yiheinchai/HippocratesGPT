# [UMP2011] Pharmacological Basis For The Treatment of Arrhythmias and For The Production of Local Anaesthesia

# General and History

### Local Anaesthetics

- They are used to produce reversible regional loss of sensation or pain, without loss of consciousness.
- They reversibly blocks generation and conduction of action potential, by affecting voltage-gated Na‚Å∫ channels which mediate the AP generation.

### History

- 1st local anaesthetic was cocaine.
- This was Isolated from coca leaves (1862).
- It was first used as local anaesthetic during eye surgery (1884).
- First used in dental surgery (1884).
- Its Toxic and addictive properties led to search for analogues that were equally effective but without these side effects:
1. **Procaine** (1905): trade name *Novocaine* from Latin *novus* (new) and *caine* (as in cocaine).
2. **Lidocaine** (1943): trade name *Xylocaine*.

# Ionic Basis of Action Potentials

- Two channels underlie the Nervous action potential (AP):
1. Na‚Å∫ channels allow Na‚Å∫ influx down the electrical and concentration gradient which depolarises the cell 
2. K‚Å∫ channels allow K‚Å∫ efflux down the concentration gradient, which repolarises the cell
- Both channel types are voltage dependent, with membrane depolarisation causing channels to open
- This transition of these channels from closed to open is known as activation
- Na‚Å∫ channel activation is rapid, followed swiftly by inactivation
- K‚Å∫ channel activation is much slower than that of Na‚Å∫ Channels and do not inactivate, opening after Na‚Å∫ Channels have opened and sufficient Na‚Å∫ Influx has occurred

![Screenshot 2021-11-27 at 00.16.29.png](%5BUMP2011%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20The%20Treatment%20%20fe912a85399a4fc0810a06cc7198d32a/Screenshot_2021-11-27_at_00.16.29.png)

- Depolarisation past a critical threshold triggers AP
- This Threshold is reached (around -40 mV)
1. When Na‚Å∫ influx > resting K‚Å∫ efflux, causing net depolarisation of the Cell Membrane

AND

1. When depolarisation due to Na‚Å∫ influx is sufficient to activate neighbouring Na‚Å∫ channels, which leads to further Na‚Å∫ Influx and Depolarisation
(a regenerative positive-feedback process)
- The selective increase in Na‚Å∫ conductance causes a shift in membrane potential towards ENa (~ +60 mV)
- Repolarisation begins when the Na‚Å∫ channels rapidly inactivate when the Membrane is depolarised and the K‚Å∫ then channels slowly activate, causing Vm to shift towards Ek and repolarise (Often below the Resting Vm temporarily due to Inactivated Na‚Å∫ Channels, causing the Membrane to be hyperpolarised)

---

# Local Anaesthetics and pH

- Most local anaesthetic agents are weak bases and hence, are incompletely ionised in solution.
- They are administered as water soluble hydrochlorides (B.HCl), where B = Tertiary Amine Base.
- After injection, tertiary amine base (B) is liberated by relatively alkaline pH of tissue fluids, causing the B.HCl compound to dissociate: B.HCl + HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª ‚áå B + ùêª‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ + Cl‚Åª
- In tissue fluid, the local anaesthetic will be present in both ionised
(NH‚Å∫) and non-ionised form (B) as some of the Dissociated Anaesthetic is ionized: B + H‚Å∫ ‚áå BH‚Å∫
- Whilst the Ionized form of the Anaesthetic cannot cross the Lipid Bilayer of the Neuron, the Non-ionised base (B) diffuses through nerve sheath, perineuronal tissues and neuronal membrane, to reach the axoplasm where it partially ionises again, inside the cell to reform BH‚Å∫ whilst some of the B remains non-ionized within the Axoplasm.
- When Na‚Å∫ channel open, the ionised form (BH‚Å∫) of the Local Anaesthetic enters the channel and combines with specific channel subunit, resulting in channel blockade.
- Within the Lipid Bilayer, the Non-Ionized form of the Local Anaesthetic (B) can pass along the inside of the Lipid Bilayer to enter the Na‚Å∫ Channel via its Lateral Pore in the Œ± Subunit, where it is also able to block the Ion Pore

# Local Anaesthetics Binding Site on Œ± Subunit of Na‚Å∫ Channel

- Œ± Subunit of Na‚Å∫ Channel contains 4 Domains, Each with 6 Transmembrane Regions, which are arranged around the central Na‚Å∫ Pore
- Local anaesthetics bind to sites located in inner cavity of pore of the Na‚Å∫ channel (S6 transmembrane domain of Œ± subunit).
- Amino acid residues in S6 segments from at least 3 or 4 domains that contribute to receptor site, with the S6 Transmembrane Region of Domain IV playing the dominant role in the formation of the Receptor Site.
- On the Sides of the Na‚Å∫ Channel Œ± Subunit, there is a central Ion Channel passing through the Length of the Channel (through the Membrane) whilst there is also pores on each side of the Channel, creating a channel that runs parallel to the Cell Membrane
- This is a potential source of Access for the Local Anaesthetic to enter the Channel, as it crosses the Lipid Bilayer, to block the Ion Pore

# Mechanism of Action

- The Pathway by which the Non-Ionised Anaesthetic Blocks the Na‚Å∫ Channel is known as the Hydrophobic Pathway
- The Pathway by which the Ionized Anaesthetic Blocks the Na‚Å∫ Channel is known as the Hydrophilic Pathway
- The Hydrophobic Pathway is not use-dependent as the Lateral Pore is not covered/blocked depending on the state of the Na‚Å∫ Channel (it is always open)
- This allows the Non-Ionised Local Anaesthetic to Block Open, Closed and Inactivated Na‚Å∫ Channels
- Hydrophilic pathways (Main pathway for Local Anaesthetic Action) exhibit strong use-dependency.
1. This is as it enters the Channel via its central pore and therefore, it cannot block the Na‚Å∫ Channel when it is closed or inactived as the Central Pore is closed in these states 
- The Block develops faster and is greater when fibre is conducting action potentials at high frequency (e.g. 10 Hz vs 1 Hz) as this increases the duration of time in which the Na‚Å∫ Channel is open (Channels are open more frequently) and hence, the period of time during which the Anaesthetic can enter the channel and block it.
1. In the Inactivated State of the Channel, the Channel has a higher affinity for the Local Anaesthetic (Both Ionised and Unionised) than in the Resting State and therefore, are more likely to be blocked by the Anaesthetic
- When the Firing Rate is high, more Na‚Å∫ Channel are inactivated at one point in time (as they are opened more frequently), hence increasing the Number of Na‚Å∫ Channels which can be blocked here

# Differences Between Local Anaesthetics

**Potency**

- Lipid solubility is most significant property in determining anaesthetic potency.
- Those that are highly lipophilic, easily penetrate nerve cell membranes and hence, are more potent as they can be found in a higher concentration inside the Nerve

**Duration of Conduction Block**

- The duration of conduction block is +ve correlated with capacity of a local anaesthetic to bind to plasma and tissue proteins.

**Onset of Conduction Block**

- pKa is pH at which 50% of agent exists in ionic, and 50% in non-ionic form.
- Lower pKa means a greater fraction of molecules exist in uncharged form.
- pKa affects onset of conduction blockage as this is related to concentration of local anaesthetic molecule present in non-ionic form (when pKa is lower, [B] increases, so more anaesthetic is able to cross nerve membrane to enter the Nerve, leading to a faster onset of anaesthesia).

---

# Physiological Characteristics of Action

### Differential Action

- All fibres can be blocked as they all express Voltage Gated Na‚Å∫ Channels which can be blocked, but thin diameter fibres are more easily blocked than thick diameter ones.
- Small myelinated fibres are more readily blocked than non- myelinated ones.
- Degree of block at a given concentration of Local Anaesthetic depends upon recent frequency of nerve activity (Due to the use-dependence of block).
- Small diameter C and Aùõø pain fibres fire at a high frequency, and are blocked earlier and sooner with low concentration of Local Anaesthetic than Aùõº fibres
- Local anaesthesia occurs in the following order:
- Pain ‚Üí cold ‚Üí warmth ‚Üí touch ‚Üí pressure ‚Üí motor function
- Recovery is in opposite direction, with motor function returning first, and pain sensation returning latest

### Metabolism

- Amino esters (e.g. procaine, tetracaine) are relatively unstable in
solution and are rapidly hydrolysed in body by plasma cholinesterase (and other esterases) - These are metabolised in the plasma.

![Screenshot 2021-11-27 at 00.45.04.png](%5BUMP2011%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20The%20Treatment%20%20fe912a85399a4fc0810a06cc7198d32a/Screenshot_2021-11-27_at_00.45.04.png)

- Amino amides (e.g. lidocaine, prilocaine) are stable in solution (as they cannot be metabolised by plasma esterases), and are slowly metabolised by hepatic amidases - These are metabolised in the Liver.

![Screenshot 2021-11-27 at 00.45.22.png](%5BUMP2011%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20The%20Treatment%20%20fe912a85399a4fc0810a06cc7198d32a/Screenshot_2021-11-27_at_00.45.22.png)

### Toxicity and Possible Side Effects

1. Local tissue injury - This may occur with infiltration and spinal anaesthesia.
2. CNS Effects:
- Low concentrations: tinnitus, numbness of tongue, blurring of vision, drowsiness.
- Higher concentrations: agitation with hyperactivity (occasionally convulsions) followed by profound CNS depression and respiratory depression.
1. Cardiovascular Effects: vasodilation, depression of myocardial activity and cardiac slowing (leading to hypotension). Eventually, it can lead to Cardiac block (Complete block of conduction through the Heart).
2. Allergic reactions: one of main breakdown products of ester types
is PABA (para-amino benzoate) which can be associated with allergic phenomena and hypersensitivity reactions.
- These unwanted side effects can be avoided by carefully selecting administration methods

---

# Methods of Administration

### Surface Anaesthesia

- Topical application to mucosa (solution, spray, jelly, lozenge) for cornea, mouth and larynx, bronchial tree, urethra and bladder.
- Examples:
1. Lidocaine
2. Benzocaine (powder for prolonged
anaesthesia of skin ulcers or burns)
3. Lidocaine/Prilocaine cream
****(EMLA/Eutectic Mixture of Local Anaesthetics).

### Infiltration Anaesthesia

- Injected directly into tissue to anaesthetise nerve endings for wound stitching, minor surgery, episiotomy during childbirth, vasectomy.
- Example: lidocaine, prilocaine
- These injections are supplemented with vasoconstrictors to delay absorption of the Anaesthetic (prolongs duration of action at the local site by reducing its systemic distribution to where it can be metabolised and ‚Üì risk of systemic toxicity caused by the action of the Local Anaesthetic in the Heart and CNS).
- Example: adrenaline, noradrenaline, vasopressin, felypressin

### Nerve Block Anaesthesia

- Drug injection close to a specific nerve trunk/bundle or branch to anaesthetise the area served by targeted nerve.
- Example: mandibular nerve (dentistry), brachial plexus (hand surgery).

### Spinal Anaesthesia

- injection into subarachnoid space (below outer membranes covering) (between 2nd and 5th lumbar
vertebrae).
- Example: major surgery (C-section).

![Screenshot 2021-11-27 at 00.50.36.png](%5BUMP2011%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20The%20Treatment%20%20fe912a85399a4fc0810a06cc7198d32a/Screenshot_2021-11-27_at_00.50.36.png)

### Epidural Anaesthesia

- Injection into epidural space (outside dura mater).
- The Local Anaesthetic has a direct action on nerve roots and spinal cord following diffusion across dura.
- Example: used in obstetrics.

### IV Regional Anaesthesia

- Drug injected intravenously, distal to a cuff/tournique on limb to produce anaesthesia of the entire arm.
- This tournique prevents the Local Anaesthetic within the Blood from being distributed systemically where it can cause CNS and Cardiac Toxicity

![Screenshot 2021-11-27 at 00.50.50.png](%5BUMP2011%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20The%20Treatment%20%20fe912a85399a4fc0810a06cc7198d32a/Screenshot_2021-11-27_at_00.50.50.png)

# Arrhythmias

- Alteration in rate of rhythm of heart, often abnormal.
- **Dysrhythmias**: abnormal rhythms.
- **Arrhythmia**: means without rhythm.
- Some dysrhythmias are quite rhythmic.
- Caused by a disruption of normal electrical conduction system of heart.
- Can be life-threatening if they cause a severe ‚Üì in pumping efficiency of heart (Ejection Fraction).
- The AP in different cells of the Heart is different, with the Duration of the Plateau Phase/Phase 2 increasing in duration as you move distally down the conduction network
- The sum of all of these different AP Morphologies produces the typical PQRST ECG

---

# Ventricular Action Potential

- Stable resting potential (4) ‚Äì set by a large K‚Å∫ permeability (due to a leak K‚Å∫ channel and a voltage-gated K‚Å∫ channel - called the Inward Rectifier K‚Å∫ channel that is open at rest), causing Vm to be near Ek
- Rising phase (0) is due to a rapid increase Na‚Å∫ conductance due to the opening of Voltage-Gated Na‚Å∫ Channels, causing Na‚Å∫ influx which depolarises the membrane
- Initial repolarisation (1) occurs as Voltage-gated Na‚Å∫ channels start to inactivate whilst K‚Å∫ Efflux is still occurring, causing minor repolarisation
- Plateau (2), as Delayed Rectifier K‚Å∫ channels and Voltage-Gated Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channels open, balancing out depolarisation (via Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Influx) and hyperpolarisaton (via K‚Å∫ Efflux)
- As the Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channel inactivates slowly, the plateau can persist for 100-200 ms until Repolarisation > Depolarisation (Until the Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Channels inactivate)
- Repolarization (3) as Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channels are inactivated whilst the Delayed Rectifier K‚Å∫ channels maintains K‚Å∫ Efflux to drive the Vm towards EK (K‚Å∫ Nernst/Equilibrium Potential).
- When Voltage-gated K‚Å∫ channels close, the Na‚Å∫ channels switch from the inactive to the closed state and the membrane is back at the stable resting potential, ready to generate another AP.
- Whereas the Neural AP is extremely rapid (1-2 msec), the Ventricular AP is very long (Around 200 ms)

# SAN and AVN Action Potential

- Phase 0 is slower and lower peak (no fast Na‚Å∫ influx, relies on
slower Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Influx to depolarise the membrane).
- This is the Unstable Pacemaker potential (4), which gradually depolarises between spikes:
- These Pronounced Depolarisations (0) occur due to Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Vs Na‚Å∫ Influx and hence, produces a slower Depolarisation
- Repolarisation is driven by Inactivation of Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Channels, reducing Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Influx, and the Activation of K‚Å∫ Channels, mediating K‚Å∫ Efflux, the net result being Repolarisation
- SNS Stimulation ****(NA via ùú∑1 AR):
- activates Na‚Å∫ and Ca¬≤‚Å∫ currents responsible for this depolarisation, and shortens internal between APs (Steep Pacemaker Potential) to increase HR.
- PSNS Stimulation (ACh via Muscarinic M2
receptors): ‚Üë K‚Å∫ conductance, which increases K‚Å∫ efflux, ‚Üì depolarisation, ‚Üë interval between APs (Shallow Pacemaker Potential) to slow down HR

# Disturbances of Cardiac Rhythm

- Normal sinus rhythm (normal rhythm): characterised by impulses from SA node conducted in sequence through atria, AV node, bundle of His, Purkinje fibres and ventricles.
- Dysrhythmias: classified according to:
1. Site of origin: e.g. atrial, nodal, ventricular.
2. Rate: tachycardia or bradycardia.
3. Process/substrate: e.g. fibrillation, heart block, ectopic

---

# Factors Responsible for Dysrhythmias

### Delayed After-Depolarisations

- When [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] ‚Üë above normal levels (as not enough Ca¬≤‚Å∫ is sequestered into the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum following AP generation), it can activate the transient
inward current ****(TI), thought to be due to stimulation of Na‚Å∫/Ca¬≤‚Å∫ exchanger (NCX) - This is an Antiporter (Secondary Active Transport) that generally uses the energy of the Na‚Å∫ influx down the [Na‚Å∫] Gradient to efflux Calcium.
- This promotes net charge entry (3 Na‚Å∫ in for each Ca¬≤‚Å∫ out) and slowly depolarises the cell, which may trigger an early (ectopic) beat if the Vm of the Cell crosses the Threshold

![Screenshot 2021-11-27 at 01.24.34.png](%5BUMP2011%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20The%20Treatment%20%20fe912a85399a4fc0810a06cc7198d32a/Screenshot_2021-11-27_at_01.24.34.png)

### Disordered Conduction (Re-Entry)

- In normal cardiac rhythm, The AP that is conducted around the Atria are cancelled out as the AP impulses converge on AV node.
- Damaged atrial muscle can lead to a unidirectional block, where the AP cannot propagate around both sides of the Atria, only around one side.
- This develops in damaged or depolarised tissue when activation wavefront of anterograde depolarising signal collides with the repolarisation phase that occurs following the preceding excitation/depolarisation wave.
- Instead of the Atrial AP being cancelled out after it travels around the Atrial Walls, the AP through the undamaged wall can continue around the Base of the Atria and slowly travel proximally/retrogradely up the Damaged Site, where it can re-excite tissue that is no longer refractory.
- This leads to a re-entrant dysrhythmia with impulse circulating indefinitely.

![Screenshot 2021-11-26 at 20.08.53.png](%5BUMP2011%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20The%20Treatment%20%20fe912a85399a4fc0810a06cc7198d32a/Screenshot_2021-11-26_at_20.08.53.png)

### Abnormal Pacemaker Activity

- Damage can induce ectopic foci (abnormal pacemaker activity where cells develop enhanced automaticity, producing abnormal pacemaker activity) in atria or ventricles.
- This can beat out of synchrony with normal rhythm.

### Heart Block

- Failure of impulse generation in SA node or failure of AP propagation through AV node, meaning the AP does not reach the Ventricles.
- Whilst the Ventricles are no longer stimulated by the AP generated in the SAN, Ventricular beating is maintained by abnormal pacemaker (e.g. Purkinje system) which is usually slow and unreliable, reducing the contractile ability of the heart.

---

# General Mechanisms of Anti-Dysrhythmic Drug Action

- Anti-Dysrhythmic Drugs may act by altering:
1. Max diastolic (most -ve) resting potential in pacemaker cells or resting potential of ventricular cells.
2. Rate of conduction (Na‚Å∫ channel blockers).
3. Rate of phase 4 depolarisation (ùú∑-blockers).
4. AP threshold (Na‚Å∫ and Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channel blockers).
5. AP duration, and thus refractory period - Period in which a new AP cannot be generated as Na‚Å∫ Channels are inactivated (K‚Å∫ channel blockers).
6. Excitability of SA node and AV conduction (Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channel antagonists).

# Vaughan-William Classification of Anti-Dysrhythmic Drugs and Limitations

| Class | Example(s) | Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ia | Disopyramide | Na‚Å∫ Channel Block (Intermediate Dissociation) |
| Ib | Lidocaine | Na‚Å∫ Channel Block (Fast Dissociation) |
| Ic | Flecainide | Na‚Å∫ Channel Block (Slow Dissociation) |
| II  | Propanolol | Œ≤-AR Antagonist |
| III | Amiodarone and Sotalol | K‚Å∫ Channel Blocker |
| IV | Verapamil | Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Channel Blocker |

![Screenshot 2021-11-26 at 20.18.05.png](%5BUMP2011%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20The%20Treatment%20%20fe912a85399a4fc0810a06cc7198d32a/Screenshot_2021-11-26_at_20.18.05.png)

### Limitations

- It was created when there were relatively few anti-dysrhythmic
drugs identified.
- Now many more drugs have been developed and there is a greater (yet incomplete) understanding of the mechanisms of Anti-Dysrhythmic Drugs.
- Classification system breaks down especially for Class I and III drugs.
- Many drugs are not wholly selective for Na‚Å∫, K‚Å∫ or Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channels:
1. Disopyramide ****(Class Ia) also has K‚Å∫ channel blocking actions.
2. Amiodarone ****(class III) also has Na‚Å∫ and Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channel blocking actions.

---

# Class I Antidysrhythmic

- Drugs that produce use-dependent block of voltage-gated Na‚Å∫ channels (Increased Block produced as the Frequency of Depolarisation/AP generation increases).
- Since 1800s, anti-malarial quinine from bark of South American
tree *Cinchona* was known to be beneficial in reducing atrial
dysrhythmias.
- Effect of quinine was first documented in 1912 by Wenckebach. Led to study of its more effective isomer **quinidine** by von Frey in 1918.

### Actions of Class I Anti-Dysrhythmics

1. ‚Üì automaticity (spontaneous impulse/AP initiation) of SA node
- Leaves fewer Na‚Å∫ channels are available to be activated to depolarise the cell, so this shift the AP threshold to more polarised values, which slows the rate of depolarisation.
- ‚Üì re-entry
- Slow conduction such that propagating AP is extinguished before it can re-excite cells in a re entrant pathway.
- Type Ia ‚Üë refractory period such that cells in re-entrant circuit can not be excited by re-entrant AP.

### Class Ia

- Example: disopyramide (quinidine, procainamide)
- Moderate block of Na‚Å∫ channels.
- Slow rise of AP.
- It produces a minor block of K‚Å∫ Channels which slows repolarisation and thus prolong the AP (but less than class III).

![Screenshot 2021-11-26 at 20.22.48.png](%5BUMP2011%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20The%20Treatment%20%20fe912a85399a4fc0810a06cc7198d32a/Screenshot_2021-11-26_at_20.22.48.png)

### Class Ib

- Example: lidocaine (mexiletine, tocainide, phenytoin)
- Associate with and dissociate from Na‚Å∫ channel rapidly (within single beat).
- It produces a small slowing of AP rise but channels are blocked following the depolarisation peak, so any premature beat is aborted.
- Also bind preferentially to inactivated Na‚Å∫ channel to produce a selective block in depolarised regions.
- They also shorten repolarisation so that the cell is depolarised for a shorter period of time

![Screenshot 2021-11-26 at 20.24.50.png](%5BUMP2011%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20The%20Treatment%20%20fe912a85399a4fc0810a06cc7198d32a/Screenshot_2021-11-26_at_20.24.50.png)

### Class Ic

- Example: flecainide (encainide)
- Associate with and dissociate from Na‚Å∫ channel slowly (so level of block constant through cardiac cycle).
- They significantly slow AP rise but have little effect of AP duration as they do not affect repolarisation.
- Show only marginally selectivity for inactivated channels unlike Class Ib.

---

# Class II Antidysrhythmic

- These are ùú∑-blockers
- Example: metoprolol, timolol, propranolol, alprenolol
- Blocks excitatory effects of sympathetic activity by blocking ùõΩ1 receptors, reducing the gradient of the Pacemaker Potential.
- ‚Üì slow inward Ca¬≤‚Å∫ current ‚Üì SA pacemaker activity, also slow AV conduction.

---

# Class III Antidysrhythmic

- These are K‚Å∫ Channel Blockers
- Example: amiodarone, sotalol
- Prolong cardiac AP and ‚Üë refractory period by reducing the K‚Å∫ Efflux which mediates Repolarisation
- This is antidysrhythmic as it ‚Üì time window in cardiac cycle when dysrhythmias can occur due to the longer refractory period

# Class IV Antidysrhythmic

- These are Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Channel Blockers
- Example: verapamil, diltiazem
- Inhibit slow inward (L-type) Ca¬≤‚Å∫ current, indirectly ‚Üì TI current by lowering [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] and hence, reducing the risk of activating the NCX (Reduced Risk of Delayed After Depolarisations).
- ‚Üì SA excitability and slow AV conduction.

# Other Drugs

### Cardiac Glycosides

- Example: **digoxin**
- Blocks Na‚Å∫/K‚Å∫ ATPase.
- Can cause dysrhythmias by depolarisation, ‚Üë intracellular Ca¬≤‚Å∫ and after-depolarisation.
- Slow AV conduction by ‚Üë vagal /PSNS outflow (can progress to AV block).
- Use: ‚Üì ventricular rates in cases of atrial fibrillation.

### Adenosine

- Potent blocker of AV nodal conduction (AI receptor linked to K‚Å∫ channels), causing hyperpolarisation.
- Used to terminate AV nodal re entrant supraventricular tachycardias.

### Magnesium Infusion

- Poorly understood but is known to affect the Na‚Å∫/K‚Å∫ ATPase, Na‚Å∫ Channels and K‚Å∫ Channels

### Catheter Ablation (Radiofrequency or Cryoablation)

- These cause physical disruption of re-entrant circuits by modifying and destroying these re-entrant circuits

### Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)

- This can defibrillate and pace the HR to restore a normal Sinus Rhythm

# Long QT Syndrome

- LQTS is characterised by prolongation of QT interval on ECG.
- QT interval Reflects duration of
ventricular depolarisation and hence, elongated the Ventricular Action Potential (Namely Phase 2/Plateau).
- Prolonged AP disposes to early after-depolarisation that may initiate dysrhythmias.

- Symptoms of LQTS:
1. Syncope (fainting)
2. Seizures
3. Sudden death resulting from a specific ventricular dysrhythmia (Torsade de pointes).

- Inherited: loss of function mutations in K‚Å∫ channels underlying repolarisation phase.
- Acquired: following exposure to certain drugs or due to electrolyte disturbances (hypokalaemia).
- Hypokalaemia increases some K‚Å∫ Currents by increasing the [K‚Å∫] Across the Cell Membrane, theoretically increasing K‚Å∫ Efflux which drives Repolarisation but also reduces Ikr (Inward Rectifying K‚Å∫ Channel) by increasing its inactivation (which is normally rather quick for a K‚Å∫ Channel), enhancing the block of the K‚Å∫ Channel by Extracellular Na‚Å∫ and Channel blocking Drugs
- This reduces Ikr which drives Ventricular Repolarisation, slowing down the repolarisation and hence, increasing the AP duration

# Drugs Affecting QT Interval

- Various drugs prolong QT interval, including those used to control dysrhythmias themselves:
1. Anti-dysrhythmics (I and III) ‚Äì sotalol, quinidine, disopyramide, procainamide, amiodarone
2. Antibiotics: erythromycin
3. Antihistamines: astemizole, terfenadine
4. Psychoactive drugs: lithium, haloperidol, tricyclic antidepressants
5. Others: amantadine, chloroquine, glibenclamide, salbutamol
- A variety of drugs can occupy a binding pocket in the cardiac K‚Å∫
channel (Kv Channel), block channel and thus prolong the QT interval.
- Extreme caution is needed when anti-dysrhythmics are given with
drugs known to prolong QT interval.
