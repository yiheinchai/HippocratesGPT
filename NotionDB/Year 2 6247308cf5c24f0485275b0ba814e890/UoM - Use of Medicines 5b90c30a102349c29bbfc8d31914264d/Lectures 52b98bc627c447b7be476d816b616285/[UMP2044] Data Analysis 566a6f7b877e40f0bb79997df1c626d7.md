# Factors Affecting Blood Pressure

### Factors Affecting Arterial Blood Pressure

- Central sympathetic tone: shown by wheelchair patients having a
low BP.
- Total peripheral resistance (vessel diameter).
- Blood gases and pH affect TPR.
- Cardiac output
- Blood volume: circulating hormone (e.g. vasopressin (ADH), aldosterone, angiotensin II (vasoconstriction action of ACE
inhibitors), kidney detects low BP leading to production of renin
(controlling change in Na⁺ levels).

### Factors Affecting Venous Blood Pressure

- Blood volume
- Sympathetic tone
- Posture (postural hypotension).
- Arterial or Venous BP can be affected in Primary Hypertension and Congestive HF, which is Rx by ACEi and Spironolactone

# Adrenoreceptor Locations

- Beta-2 AR Tend to be uninnervated

### Eye

- Clinical relevance: glaucoma
- 𝛼1 - Pupil radial muscle contraction/dilation → ↓ aqueous
- 𝛼2 - On ciliary body → ↓ aqueous humour production.
- 𝛽1 - On ciliary body + dilation of afferent vessels → ↑ aqueous humour production (effect of timolol)

### Lungs

- Clinical relevance: asthma
- 𝛽2 - Bronchodilation (uninnervated). Only innervation is cholinergic.

### Heart

- Clinical relevance: angina, hypertension
- 𝛽1 - +ve chronotropic and inotropic response (innervated).

### Blood Vessels

- Clinical relevance: hypertension
- 𝛼1 - Arterial. Vascular smooth muscle constriction (innervated).
- 𝛼1/𝛼2 - Venous constriction (innervated).
- 𝛽2 - Skeletal muscle blood vessels (uninnervated). With 𝛼2 (innervated on venous side).

### GI Tract

- 𝛼2 - Relaxation - innervated receptor that affects cholinergic transmission in myenteric plexus (i.e. inhibition of ACh release from parasympathetic nerve endings) but also has opiate action leading to constipation (i.e. anti-diarrhoeal).
- 𝛽2 - Relaxation (uninnervated). Involuntary venting/defecation during fight or flight

### Kidney

- Clinical relevance: renin-dependent secondary hypertension.
- 𝛽1 - ↑ renin release from juxtaglomerular cells.

### Bladder

- Clinical relevance: benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH).
𝛽2 - Relaxation detrusor (uninnervated)
- 𝛼1 - Contraction of trigone and sphincter.

### Salivary Gland

- 𝛼? - Secretion of thick saliva.

### Platelets and Presynaptic

- 𝛼2 - ↓ transmitter release.

### Uterus

- 𝛼1 - Contraction
- 𝛽 - Relaxation

# Effects of Drugs on Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

### Noradrenaline **(**𝜶 > 𝜷)

- ↑ in BP (both diastolic and systolic), but no tachycardia as baroreceptor reflex due to rise in BP causes a bradycardia.
- HR - No change, or slight ↓. Unpredictable due to direct 𝛽1 → ↑ HR opposing reflex to ↑ BP/PR → ↓ HR.
- BP -  ↑ 𝛼1 effect.
- TPR - ↑ 𝛼1 effect.

### Adrenaline **(**𝜶 = 𝜷)

- ↑ systolic (𝛼1) and ↓ diastolic (𝛽2) overall no change in mean BP thus tachycardia will be observed.
- HR - ↑ direct 𝛽1 causing Tachycardia. There is no reflect bradycardia because net ∆ 𝐵𝑃 = 0.
- BP - ↑ systolic 𝛼1 effect. BP ↓ diastolic 𝛽2 effect so Net ∆ 𝐵𝑃 = 0.
- TPR - ↑ 𝛼1 effect opposes ↓ diastolic 𝛽2

### Isoprenaline (𝜷 **only)**

- ↓ in BP (diastolic greater than systolic) and a reflex and direct tachycardia.
- Diastolic pressure is an indicator of TPR.
- HR -  Direct ↑ by 𝛽1 → tachycardia and reflex to ↓ PR → ↑ indirect tachycardia.
- BP - ↓ Systolic and ↓ Diastolic
- TPR - ↓ 𝛽2 effect with no opposing ↑ 𝛼1 effect.

# Modulators of HR and BP

- V = NA → ↑ BP, reflex bradycardia.
- Z = A
- W = Isoprenaline → ↓ BP, tachycardia.
- S = Tyramine → ↑ BP, tachycardia.
- X = Cocaine
- T = Propranolol
- U = Phentolamine (𝛼 Antagonist) → ↓ BP, tachycardia.
- Y = Angiotensin → ↑ BP (Vasoconstriction)
- This experiment demonstrates the Cheese Reaction due to MAO-A Inhibition by Antidepressants

# Extra Information

- pA2: concentration of antagonist when double agonist is required
to have same effect on receptor as when no antagonist is present.
- Higher pA2 value tells you at what concentration to double effect.
- pA2 = 9 tells us that at nanomole range, we need to double concentration for agonist to have same effect.
