# [UMP2043] Pharmacology of Antibacterial Drugs

# Chemotherapy and Antibiotics

### Chemotherapy

- Term coined by Paul Ehrlich to describe use of drugs that are
maximally parasitotropic (specific to parasites) and minimally organotropic (not specific to host tissues).
- Pessimistic view since many antibiotics are now quite specific with very little side effects due to the activity of antibiotics on host cells.
- This is now understood to be pharmacological therapies that are targetted against markers that are unique on pathogens and cancer cells but not expressed on host cells

### Antibiotics

- Originally defined in terms of ability of 1 microorganism to kill
another.
- Now used to describe actual active agents and includes synthetic
antimicrobial agents.

---

# Strategy of Antimicrobial Action

- Exploit Biochemical differences between parasite and host cells based on evolutionary differences between the 2.
- E.g Bacteria are Prokaryotic with a Single Naked Chromosome, Lack Mitochondria and contain a Cell Wall with no sterol metabolism being associated with cell wall/membrane synthesis
1. Cell wall synthesis or destruction
2. Nucleic acid synthesis.
3. Protein synthesis

---

# Types of Antibiotics

- Bactericidal antibiotics: kills bacteria.
- Bacteriostatic antibiotics: slows bacterial proliferation by lowering ability of microbes to divide.
- Effectiveness is dependent on a competent immune system as a host cell-mediated immune response is required to completely remove all bacteria after their proliferation has been inhibited.
- This means they are ineffective (or less effective) in immunocompromised patients or where there is local immune-exclusion (where immune response cannot reach the site of infection) as non-proliferating bacteria cannot be destroyed to remove the infection.

---

# Types of Microorganisms Targeted With Antibiotics

- Gram +ve bacteria: stain violet with gram stain.
- Thick cell wall of 5- 50 nm width (50% peptidoglycan, 45% acidic polymer (-ve charge) and rest protein and polysaccharide).
- Gram -ve bacteria: not permeated by gram stain and therefore, stain pink.
- Thinner (1-2mm thickness) but more complex cell wall than gram +ve bacteria, with an outer lipid bilayer, inner Lipoprotein layer and thin proteoglycan composition.
- Their complexity is further assisted by the presence of additional components such as Lipopolysaccharide in the Outer Membrane which makes them unique in regards to the antibiotics that target them and the severity of infection that they can cause (usually very severe due to the presence of Complex Polysaccharides on the Cell Membrane)
- Cell wall is relatively impermeant and therefore resistant to many antibiotics but antibiotics can enter the cell via Porins.
- Within the Periplasmic Space (Between Outer Membrane and Peptidoglycan) and on the Outer Membrane, enzymes like Œ≤-lactamases can be found that degrade antibiotics

- Mycobacteria: distinct cell-wall composition with myolic acid.
- Fungi: distinct cell wall composition with ergosterol instead of cholesterol as primary sterol.

# Antibiotics Acting on Synthesis or Destruction of Cell Wall

- Example:
1. ùú∑-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins).
2. Vancomycin
3. Polymyxins
4. Anti-mycobacterials
- These tend to be bacteriocidal
- Bacterial Cell Wall is comprised of Peptidoglycan and is necessary to provide the cell with water impermeability and prevent cell lysis by resisting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm - When the cell wall is absent/its synthesis is inhibited and the the bacterium grows/divides, there are now new regions of the cell membrane that are not covered by cell wall, causing water influx into the bacterium through these areas, leading to bacterial cell lysis

### ùú∑-Lactams (Penicillins and Cephalosporins)

- Penicillin was discovered from *penicillium notatum* Fleming (1928)
but was refined and produced by Florey and Chain (1940-41).
- Cephalosporins were discovered from *Cephalosporium* species in
1960s.
- ùõΩ-lactams are derived from cysteine and valine and have a ùõΩ-lactam ring + thiazolidine ring AKA 6-Aminopenicillanic Acid Moiety). They disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis through inhibition of proteoglycan component synthesis.

**Mechanism of Action**

- Cell wall is built up of linear polymers of 2 sugars, NAG (N- acetylglucosamine) and NAM (N-acetylmuramic acid), linked by glycosidic bonds, to form proteoglycans.
- Crosslinking of Linear Polysaccharide chains is required to increase the structural integrity of the cell wall and this is achieved by side chains of NAM, comprised of Amino Acids that themselves have side chains which form bonds with amino acids on the side chains of other polysaccharide chains to link multiple polymers together
- This crosslinking requires a transpeptidation reaction to attach the Side Chain of one AA associated with one Polysaccharide Chain to the a D-Alanine in a Dipeptide D-Alanine found at the end of a side chain from another Polysaccharide Chain
- This is then followed by a Decarboxylation step where the terminal D-Alanine from the Terminal Dipeptide is cleaved from the molecule and lost

![Screenshot 2022-03-11 at 17.32.17.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-11_at_17.32.17.png)

- The shape of the Terminal D-Alanine Dipeptide is mimicked by ùõΩ-lactams, which provides the ùõΩ-lactams with their antibiotic activity.
- This mimickry allows ùõΩ-lactams to bind to the active site of transpeptidase (penicillin binding protein) and act as a competitive antagonist here to prevent transpeptidation and decarboxylation reactions to prevent cross-bridge formation within the Cell Wall, disrupting and weakening the cell wall causing cell lysis (bactericidal)
- Mechanism of action (short): inhibit synthesis of proteoglycan
polymer in bacterial cell wall. Therefore exhibit bactericidal
activity.

![Screenshot 2022-03-11 at 17.32.57.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-11_at_17.32.57.png)

- If ùõΩ-lactamases cleave the ùõΩ-lactam ring within the ùõΩ-lactam antibiotic, this alters the shape of the antibiotic so that it no long resembles the shape of the D-Alanine Dipeptide, preventing the Antibiotic from binding to the Transpeptidase active site, causing loss of antibiotic activity

### Mechanism of Resistance

- Penicillin G/Benzylpenicillin, Penicillin V/Phenoxymethylpenicillin and Procaine-Benzathine-Penicillins - Bactericidal ABxs largely active against gram +ve.
- They have has relatively poor CSF Penetrance except for in Meningitis where increased BBB permeability allows Benzylpenicillin to enter the Brain.
- They are excreted by the Kidneys and some bacteria show resistance to these via ùõΩ-lactamase expression
- Penicilin G/Benzylpenicillin must be administered IV as it is not orally active, Penicillin V/Phenoxymethylpenicilin is less bioactive than Benzylpenicillin but is orally active and can be administered orally and Procaine-Benzathine-Penicillins can be administered IM Depot to allow for long duration/slow acting administration to allow for greater pharmacokinetic control
- Penicillinase (ùú∑-lactamase) resistant isoxazolylpenicillins have been developed as the drugs above can be degraded by ùõΩ-lactamase/Penicillinase and hence, bacteria have developed resistance to them, whilst these drugs cannot be degraded by ùõΩ-lactamases so Bacteria have not developed resistance to these drugs via enzymatic mechanisms
- These are bactericidal ABx, mostly active towards gram +ve and can be administered I.V. (Methicillin) or orally (Others like Flucloxacilin).
- Methicilin is not used as it is very toxic so other oral ùõΩ-lactams derived from Methcillin that are not toxic are used instead
- These have good CSF Penetrance as well in the normal state (Non-Inflammatory States)
- MRSA has acquired means other than ùõΩ-lactamase activity to
inactive these antibiotics so both types of Penicillins are not effective for the Rx of MRSA.

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 14.59.13.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_14.59.13.png)

- As other Penicillins are very narrow spectrum in their activity, mainly targeted against Gram +ve bacteria
- Amino-penicillins: hydrophilic so can enter gram -ve bacteria via
porins to become broad spectrum with activity on G+ve and G-ve bacteria.
- E.g Ampicillin and Amoxicillin ‚Üí These are administered orally with reasonably good CSF Penetration (Notably in Inflammation like Meningitis) but resistance has also developed to these drugs
- Can be co-administered with adjuncts like clavulanic acid or sulbactam, ùõΩ-lactamase inhibitor, to ensure the ABx are not inactivated and hence, active against bacteria that would otherwise be resistant to these ABx.
- Carboxy-penicillins: show additional activity against pseudomonas
species (Extended Spectrum Activity), often prescribed with adjuncts like Clavulinic Acid to allow for activity of these drugs against bacteria that would otherwise show resistance to these Abx.
- E.g Carbenicillin
- Ureido-penicillins: show additional activity against pseudomonas
species and are excreted in bile additionally.
- E.g Azlocillin

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.00.23.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.00.23.png)

- Synthetic ùú∑-lactams: show good activity to both gram +ve and -ve.
- E.g Carbapenums (Like Imipenem) and Monobactams (E. Aztreonam)
- Carbapenums show activity against G+ve and G-ve whilst Monobactams show activity only against G-ve
- 1st generation cephalosporins: only show activity against gram +ve bacteria. (E.g Cephardoxil)
- 2nd generation cephalosporins: gram +ve > gram -ve. (E.g Cefuroxime)
- 3rd generation cephalosporins: gram -ve > gram +ve. (E.g Ceftriaxone)
- As you go from 1st ‚Üí 2nd ‚Üí 3rd Generation, Oral Bioavailability and Spectrum of the drugs increases, with 2nd and 3rd Generation showing Good CSF Penetration whilst 1st Gen Cephalosporins show poor CSF Penetrance, even in inflammed states like meningitis
- Some cephalosporinase producing organisms can inactivate cephalosporins and hence, are resistant to cephalosporins.
- Their main clinical utility comes from the fact that they have very high CSF penetrance and can be used for Infections of the CNS

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.01.01.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.01.01.png)

### Summary

- Characterised by Œ≤-lactam ring structure.
- Group now include the Penicillins and Cephalosporins.
- Function by inhibiting the synthesis of the proteoglycan polymer in the bacterial cell-wall.
- They have bactericidal Activity.
- They are broken down by Œ≤-lactamaseenzymes (penicillinases) produced by resistant bacteria but this can be overcome via the use of adjuncts that inhibit the enzymes that provide this resistance (E.g Clavulinic Acid) or by producing ABx resistant to enzymatic degradation

### Side Effects

1. Hypersensitivity - Degradation products of penicillins act as haptens that combine with host proteins to evoke an immune response (Allergic Reaction). Will cause anaphylactic shock.
2. Broad spectrum types given orally can alter gut flora and produce GI Disturbances (Diarrhoea) as well as increasing the risk of superinfection by commensals normally found in the gut (E.g C.diff)

---

# Complex Glycopeptides - Vancomycin

**Mechanism of Action**

- Early on in the Synthesis of the Proteoglycan Cell Wall, Dimers of NAM-NAG is polymerised to form the Proteoglycan Main Chain via Transglycoylation
- Instead of mimicking D-alanine, Glycopeptides directly bind to D-alanine residues on end of the NAM Monomer with high
affinity, producing steric hinderance that prevents transglycosylation from occurring, preventing the synthesis of the main proteoglycan polymer chain
- It shows bactericidal activity.
- Structurally a complex glycopeptide and does not contain a ùõΩ-lactam ring so not broken down by ùõΩ-lactamases
- It primarily shows activity against G+ve Bacteria and hence, is narrow spectrum
- It is usually administered IV but can be administered orally to kill bacteria within the Gut (E.g C.diff) to sterilise it
- It has moderate CSF Penetrance, only when Meninges are inflammed in Meningitis
- Due to its inhibition of Transglycosylation (More General Reaction) than Transpeptidation (which is more specific to bacteria), it has a wider side effect profile than ùõΩ-lactams

### Uses - Due to Its Wide Side Effect Profile, It Is Reserved For:

- Penicillin and cephalosporin/Penicillin sensitive individuals.
- MRSA Infections
- Superinfection of bowel by *Clostridium difficile*

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.03.04.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.03.04.png)

---

# Polymyxins

- Mechanism of action: amphipathic cationic detergents that
intercalate into outer lipid membrane of Gram -ve bacteria comprised of Lipopolysaccharide, creating pores within the Cell Wall to allow water to diffuse into the cells and cause lysis (bactericidal).

### Uses

- Polymyxin B and E are G-ve selective (as G+ve do not have lipid components within their cell wall that can be targeted)
- Limited to topical application in ear (otitis), eye and skin infections or for sterilisation before surgery as they are incredibly toxic due to their activity on lipid membranes that are also found in eukaryotic cells.
- They are not susceptible to degradation by ùõΩ-lactamases and hence, can be used systemically in emergencies where bacteria are resistant to all other ABx tried before (E.g MRSA with additional resistance)

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.03.48.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.03.48.png)

# Anti-Mycobacterials

- Process of outer membrane synthesis in mycobacteria involves synthesis and incorporation of mycolic acid (essential constituent of mycobacterial cell wall) into the cell wall.
- Isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of Mycolic Acid whereas Ethambutol inhibits the Incorporation of Mycolic Acid into the Mycobacterial Cell Wall,
- These are mainly bacteriostatic (if the bacteria are no longer proliferating) but can be bactericidal if the bacteria are rapidly dividing (in their growth phase)

### Isoniazid

- Mechanism of action: Isoniazid is a pyridine derivative that is related to nicotinamide.
- Inhibits synthesis of mycolic acid.
- It can be administered orally or IV and has good CSF Penetrance due to their small size
- It is metabolised in the liver via acetylation and some Mycobacteria tuberculosis have developed resistance to Isoniazid

**Uses**:

1. Isoniazid-sensitive *Mycobacteria* species strains.
2. First line drug in *M. tuberculosis*.
3. It is useful against Intracellular microorganisms (well absorbed by tissues - 20% plasma - and therefore, penetrate efficiently into caseous tuberculosis lesions)

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.04.44.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.04.44.png)

### Ethambutol

- Simple branched aliphatic compound.
- Inhibits incorporation of mycolic acid into mycobacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall.
- It has very specific bacteriostatic/bactericidal action against mycobacteria dependent on whether the bacteria is proliferating rapidly or not and due to its high specificity, it has very few side effects.
- Like Isoniazid, it can be administered IV or Orally and due to its simple structure and small size, it has good CSF Penetrance in non-inflamed states
- It is excreted by the Kidneys and Drugs have not developed resistance against Ethambutol

**Uses:**

1. Anti-tuberculotic drug against isoniazid and streptomycin-resistant tubercle bacilli.
2. Well absorbed so useful against intracellular parasites.
3. Penetrates CSF so useful for tuberculous meningitis.

# Antibiotics Acting on Nucleic Acid Synthesis

1. Nucleoside/Nucleotide Synthesis Inhibitors
2. DNA Gyrase Inhibitors
3. RNA Polymerase Inhibitors

### Nucleoside/Nucleotide Synthesis Inhibitors - Antimetabolites

- Folic acid is an essential cofactor to various methyltransferases
involved in production of nucleotides that cannot be synthesised endogenous and hence, must be derived exogenously from the diet.
- This means that drugs that target Folic Acid Synthesis are selective for Prokaryotes like Bacteria where this pathway is found, without affecting metabolic pathways in Eukaryotic Human Cells that do not contain these pathways
- Antimetabolites are based on the structure of Folic Acid (either the Pteridine Ring or the Para-aminobenzoic Acid Moieties) and target the synthesis of tetrahydrofolate, which is the main substrate for Nucleotide Synthesis.
- Sulphonamide - mechanism of action: structural analogues of p-
aminobenzoic acid moiety of folic acids.
- It inhibits dihydropteroate synthetase (DHO) (1st enzyme in folic acid synthesis).
- Trimethoprim - mechanism of action: structural analogue of
pteridine p-aminobenzoic acid adduct, so inhibits dihydrofolate
reductase (FHS-reductase) (2nd enzyme in folic acid synthesis).
- Sulphonamide and trimethoprim interfere with thymidylate
synthesis and are bacteriostatic by preventing DNA Synthesis and hence, proliferation.
- Both are broad spectrum antibiotics (active against G+ve and G-ve Bacteria) and are well absorbed (administered orally) with good CSF Penetrance, but their use has been superseded due to development of resistance.
- **Uses**:
1. Non-resistant cases (inexpensive and sparing on gut flora)
2. Co-trimoxazole (made of trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole - a sulphonamide - in ratio of 5:1): AIDS patients susceptible to pneumonia caused by *Pneumocystis carnii* (protozoan/fungi).
3. Trimethoprim is also used alone for UTIs and Respiratory Infections
4. Silver sulphadiazine used topically for burns.
5. Sulphasalazine (sulphapyridine-salicylate, a combination of an Antifolate and an Anti-Inflammatory Drug, where the antifolate acts as a drug carrier for the Anti-Inflammatory Drug) used for inflammatory bowel disease.
- Sulphonamides have been used as precursors for the synthesis Sulphonylureas and Thiazides

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.06.50.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.06.50.png)

- Sulfones are structurally and mechanistically related to
sulphonamides, but additionally affect *Mycobacteria* species.
- Dapsone has a similar drug profile to Sulphonamides but has selectivity for Mycobacterium leprae
- **Uses**:
1. Dapsone (a sulfone) is first line drug against leprosy.
2. Very well absorbed orally and used in combination with rifampicin for tuberculoid leprosy, with rifampicin and clofazimine (complex dye) for lepromatous leprosy
3. It is used with pyrimethamine against drug resistant malaria and toxoplasmosis.

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.08.34.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.08.34.png)

# DNA Gyrase Inhibitors - Quinolones

- E.g Nalidixic Acid and Ciprofloxacin
- DNA gyrase (or topoisomerase II) is an enzyme that supercoils and uncoils DNA within the Bacterial Chromosome to allow it to be tightly packaged within the bacterium but unwound when genes need to be replicated for Proliferation.
- DNA Gyrase does this by introducing nicks/cleaving DNA strands to allow the DNA sequence to unwind, which frees the unwound segment of DNA to allow it to be replicated by DNA Polymerase
- Mechanism of action: inhibits DNA topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase)
so that the DNA breaks introduced by Topoisomerase II are permanent, the unwound DNA Segment to disintegrate, preventing supercoiling of bacterial DNA.
- They are bactericidal and have a broad-spectrum of activity against G+ve and G-ve bacteria.
- Particularly useful against gram-ve bacteria and against strains
that are resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides or when there is sensitivity to these ABx.
- They can be administered IV or orally and have good CNS Penetrance
- However, their regular usage means that some bacteria are now resistant to Quinolones
- Nalidixic acid was 1st compound, but is now superseded by
fluorinated derivatives (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, acrosoxacin.
- **Uses of Fluoro-Quinolones:**
1. UTIs and prostatitis caused by gram-ve enteric bacteria.
2. Acute diarrhoeal disease caused by G-ve bacteria *E. coli*, *Shigella, Salmonella* and *Campylobacter*.
3. *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* infections (respiratory, cystic fibrosis, invasive external otitis).
4. Gram -ve osteomyelitis.
5. Active against *H. influenza* and penicillinase-producing *N. gonorrhoea* which are resistant to other antibiotics

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.10.21.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.10.21.png)

# RNA Polymerase Inhibitors - Macrocyclic

- E.g Rifampicin
- RNA polymerase produces primary transcript from DNA in transcription, which is necessary for constructing RNA chains in transcription.
- Mechanism of action: inhibits RNA polymerase in prokaryotic
pathogen but does not affect host eukaryotic enzyme, meaning they are selective and do not inhibit eukaryotic gene expression.
- It has a broad-spectrum of activity (G+ve, G-ve and Mycobacteria) and is bacteriostatic at therapeutic concentrations by preventing Transcription and hence, production of proteins that are required for the production of new bacteria via Binary Fission.
- **Uses**:
1. Very active against intracellular microorganisms (E.g Mycobacteria), particularly in combination treatment against tuberculosis (with isoniazid and ethambutol) and leprosy.

---

# Antibiotics Acting to Inhibit Protein Synthesis

1. Tetracyclines
2. Aminoglycosides
3. Chloramphenicol
4. Macrolides
- Protein Translation = Amino-acyl-tRNA binds to A-site ‚Üí transpeptidation of amino acid chain from P-site to amino-acyl-tRNA on A-site ‚Üí translocation of tRNA with its dipeptide attached from A-site to P-site due to release of unpaired tRNA from P Site.
- As the Bacterial Ribosome (30s/50s) is distinct from the Eukaryotic Ribosome (40s/60s), These antibiotics are selective against Prokaryotic Protein Synthesis and do not alter Eukaryotic Protein Synthesis

### Tetracyclines (E.g Tetracycline, Chlorotetracycline)

- Mechanism of action: bind to the 30s subunit of the Ribosome to prevent the binding of the Aminoacyl-tRNA to 30s subunit, preventing elongation of the protein, leading to the truncation of the protein.
- They are bacteriostatic as inhibition of Protein synthesis prevents the synthesis of proteins that are required for the normal functioning of daughter cells and hence, prevents binary fission and proliferation from occurring.
- They have broad spectrum activity against G+ve and G-ve Bacteria and show poor penentrance into the CNS in physiological states but good penetrance during inflammatory states like Meningitis
- They are excreted via the kidneys and through bile but some bacteria have developed resistance against tetracyclines
- They can be administered IV and Orally but form complex with multivalent metal ions (Ca, Mg, Fe and Al) which prevent them from being able to bind to 30s subunits and producing their antibacterial effect so they need to be administered without food and certainly without milk, antacid or iron preparations.
- **Uses**:
1. 1st line for infections with intracellular parasites: rickettsia, mycoplasma, chlamydia as well as brucellosis, cholera, plague and Lyme disease (spirochaete).

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.12.54.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.12.54.png)

### Aminoglycosides (Gentamycin and Streptomycin)

- Apparently always comes up in Exams according to Prof Sihra
- Mechanism of action: bind to both 30s and 50s subunits to
prevent codon-anticodon recognition of tRNA and mRNA at the A Site, causing a point sense mutation to occur in the protein.
- They are bactericidal, with extended spectrum activity (Mainly G+ve and G-ve but with minor activity on Pseudomonas).
- Due to their high polarity, high doses need to be administered to produce therapeutic activity, meaning that they are often Ototoxic and Nephrotoxic, notbably in elderly, and produce NMJ Impairment (Due to activity on presynaptic receptors to inhibit ACh release) which can produce Myasthenia Gravis like Sx
- **Uses:**
1. Extremely polar molecules not absorbed orally and have poor CNS Penetrance so administered IV/IM or topically
2. Limited to life-threatening situations involving infection with gram -ve enteric bacilli.
3. Mycoplasma infections causing tuberculosis (specifically streptomycin).
4. Sepsis and nosocomial infections in hospital burns units where prophylactic use of other antibiotics has to led to resistant strains developing.
5. Neomycin before bowel surgery to sterilise the bowel.

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.13.54.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.13.54.png)

### Chloramphenicol

- Mechanism of action: binds to the 50s subunit to prevent transpeptidation reaction between growing peptide chain and amino-acyl tRNA, causing premature termination of protein synthesis.
- It is bacteriostatic and have broad spectrum activity (G+ve and G-ve) and can be administered orally, IV or IM
- Its usage has been limited as numerous bacteria have developed resistant to Chloraphenicol
- Use: excellent absorption including good CNS permeability (so often used to Rx Meningitis).
1. Limited to life-threatening infections of respiratory tract, ear, sinuses, meninges where there is resistance to other drugs that might be more preferable.

![Screenshot 2022-03-10 at 15.14.36.png](%5BUMP2043%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Antibacterial%20Drugs%20b2d65d50b2e04972a02362fb610353f2/Screenshot_2022-03-10_at_15.14.36.png)

### Macrolides (Erythromycin and Clarithromycin)

- Mechanism of action: binds to P-site on 50s subunit, preventing
translocation of the tRNA containing growing amino-acyl-peptide chain from the A to the P site, preventing additional Aminoacyl-tRNAs from binding to the A Subunit, preventing the peptide from being extended.
- They are mainly bacteriostatic but can be bactericidal for some organisms
- They have a narrow spectrum activity, mainly active against G+ve bacteria but can be administered Orally or IV
- They have good penentrance when administered during Inflammatory States (E.g Meningitis) and are metabolised and excreted by the Liver and Bile

**Uses**:

1. Well absorbed as a weak base and enters macrophages but
doesn‚Äôt enter CNS.
2. Pneumonia caused by *Mycoplasma* species and *Legionella* species (Legionaries disease).

### 5-Nitroimadazoles

- Mechanism of action: disrupt ETC in anaerobic bacteria, picking
up electrons from Ferridoxin and interacting with DNA to interfere
with template and cause mutations and ‚Üì replication.
- They show selectivity for Anaerobic Bacteria despite both Eukaryotic and Bacteria using the same ETC to produce ATP as the Anaerobic ETC has a very negative Vm, using a H‚ÇÇ electron acceptor, whilst the Human ETC has a very positive Vm, using O‚ÇÇ as an electron acceptor
- This means that the Anaerobic ETC can reduce Metronidazole to produce a toxin with alters Bacterial DNA whereas the Human ETC cannot, meaning Metronidazole selectively alters Anaerobic DNA but does not affect the Human DNA
- Use:
1. Drug of choice against *Helicobacter pylori*.

# Resistance and Code of Practice

### Resistance

- Antibiotic resistance is increasing in prevalence due to increased inappropriate prescription and usage of antibiotics, where the antibiotics provide a selection pressure to the bacteria which allows them to develop mechanisms which allow them to become resistant to the bacteria
- Moreover, this resistance does not occur due to the acquisition of a single resistance mechanism, making it increasingly difficult to combat resistance to maintain the efficacy of ABx
- Resistance can arise due to the expression of enzymes that degrade the ABx (E.g Œ≤-Lactamases), Reduced binding affinity of the Drug Target to their ABx (E.g Œ≤-Lactams and Macrolides), overexpression of enzymes that the ABx inhibits (E.g Transpeptidases for Penicillins), Chemical Inactivation of ABx (E.g Aminoglycosides and Chloramphenicol), Increased Expression of Efflux Pumps that efflux the ABx from the bacteria
- Sulphonamide resistance occurs due to enzyme targets having a reduced affinity for the Sulphonamide whilst affinity for their normal substrate is unaffected
- Currently, there is no known drug resistance against 5-Nitroimidazoles like Metronidazole

### Code of Practice

- ABx Code of Practice regarding when certain ABx should be prescribed have been developed to minimise the risk of ABx Resistance developing
- Antibiotics should not be given for infections that have a good
record for ‚Äònatural‚Äô cure via the activity of the immune system nor for superficial infections that can be treated by washing or skin softening ointments.
- Prophylaxis only in certain circumstances (e.g. large bowel
surgery, orthopaedic or cardiac surgery or amputation).
- They should not be used to replace Aseptic Technique/Handling
- If time permits, wait for laboratory test to target therapy to allow for the identification of the organism and its sensitivity so that specific ABx can be used instead of Broad Spectrum ABxs
- Continue treatment with full therapeutic dose for an adequate period to ensure that the microorganism is complely eliminated via the action of the ABx and Immune Response, preventing bacteria that are not eliminated from developing resistance
- In local treatment of superficial infections, use antibiotics which are rarely used systematically.
- Antibiotic solutions should not be liberated into environment where environmental bacteria can be exposed to the ABx and develop resistance.
- In hospitals, use combined antibiotics (use antibiotics in rotation)
- This keeps a certain antibiotic which has been shown to have a very high efficacy for a specific infection, in reserve for emergency.
