# [UMP2033]  General Inflammation and Small Molecule Mediators

# Basic Principles of Inflammation

- Cardinal signs of inflammation: heat, redness, swelling, pain, loss of function.
- Initiator: infection, trauma (physical and chemical), hypersensitivity reactions, neoplasm.
- Classically, Chronic Inflammation is associated with Autoimmune and Hypersensitivity Reactions but is now known to be involved in CVD, Metabolic Diseases, Neurological Diseases and Cancer
- Whilst inflammation is implicated in the Pathophysiology of many conditions, Inflammation is required for immune defense to maintain normal health as inflammatory mediators are inherently destructive but involved in a protective mechanism
- Aim: remove stressful stimuli, kill, dilute, wall-off stimulus (i.e. silicon or tuberculosis causing granuloma), prepare.
- Dysfunctional inflammation (too little) can be result of primary immunodeficiency (chronic granuloma disease where an enzyme producing ROS is dysfunctional, and these individuals get recurring infections) (SCID) or acquired immunodeficiency (secondary immunodeficiency) (HIV).
- In Inflammation, a Noxious Stimulus is detected by Sentinel Cells (Mast Cells, Tissue Resident Macrophages or Sensory Neurons) ‚Üí Vasodilation and Increased Vascular Permeability, causing Hyperaemia and Formation of Inflammatory Exudate in the ECF ‚Üí Activity of Chemokines and Upregulation of Adhesion Molecules on Vascular Endothelium leads to recruitment of Neutrophils initially and then Macrophages (Cellular Component of Response)
- Neutrophils and Macrophages release Anti-Microbial molecules (ROS and Proteases etc.) and are involved in Phagocytosis in the infected tissue to destroy pathogens present and remove cellular debris
- This innate immune response can stimulate the Adaptive Immune Response via Antigen Presentation
- The activity of Lymphocytes in the Infected Tissue can lead to further Neutrophil and Macrophage recruitment, continuing on the Cycle of Inflammation
- Alternative, if the Infection resolves and the noxious stimulus is removed, a Routining Phase can occur alongside Inflammation Resolution, which restores homeostasis within the Tissue
- However, Excessive Inflammation can lead to continuous cycles of tissue damage, which lead to further inflammation via a positive feedback (Notably When the Stimulus is an Endogenous Molecule, causing Autoimmunity)

- In an Inflammatory Response, a sequential release pattern of Inflammatory Mediators is seen
- Initially, Increased Vascular Permeability is mediated by Bradykinin, Complement, Exudation and 5-HT
- Following this, Vascular Permeability and Neutrophil Recruitment is further increased by Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Neuropeptides
- Neutrophils then produce Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines like TNF-Œ±, leading to the recruitment of Macrophages, which release further pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Finally, Immune Cells release Anti-Inflammatory mediators (E.g TGF-Œ≤) to terminate inflammation and allow for tissue homeostasis to return

- Chemical mediators can work in a number of ways (autocrine, endocrine, intracrine, paracrine, juxtacrine) and vary in size and chemical structure, which significantly impacts their pharmacology.
- Reactivity often determines the signalling mechanism of Chemical Mediators, where unstable/highly reactive mediators only act via Juxtacrine/Paracrine mechanisms (in the local vicinity) whereas more stable/less reactive mediators can act via Endocrine Mechanisms
- Autopharmacology ‚Üí This is where a physiological/pathophysiological process is controlled by Endogenous Mediators
- The same mediators can activate different signalling cascades and produce different effects when acting over different distances (e.g Endocrine and Paracrine)

### Acute Vs Chronic Inflammation

- Acute Inflammation is activated by Noxious Stimuli and has 2 phases ‚Üí Vascular Changes and Recruitment of Innate Immune System.
- If Noxious Agent is removed, Inflammation can resolve and healing occurs or Pus formation can occur, leading to abscess formation which can cause Fibrosis
- Acute Inflammation can progress into Chronic Inflammation
- Chronic Inflammation can be initiated and maintained by Chronic Infections or Persistent Injury (E.g Arising from Acute Infection) or Autoimmunity
- Chronic Inflammation is associated with Macrophages, Neutrophils and Angiogenesis
- Chronic Inflammation also tends to be regulated by the Adaptive Immune System vs Acute Inflammation that is regulated predominantly by the Innate Immune System
- Chronic Inflammation can lead to Fibrosis, which contributes to Loss of Function seen in Inflammation

# General Properties of Inflammatory Mediators

### Additional Properties Associated with Inflammatory Mediators

- Synergy: synergistic +ve feedback system where the presence of A+B together increases their activity so that the combined effect is greater than the additive effects of A and B when present individually.
- E.g When CGRP is added to other Inflammatory mediators that act on Vasculature (E.g Bradykinin, Substance P), the combined effect of these 2 substances is greater than the additive effect of their activity when present individually
- Therefore, to produce a therapeutic effect on Inflammation, you must inhibit the activity of an Inflammatory Mediator significantly (90-95%) due to synergy from other mediators significantly increasing its activity

### Inflammatory Cell Migration

- Inflammation can be prevented by inhibiting how inflammatory cells adhere to endothelium (Downregulation of Adhesion Molecules that are usually upregulated in inflammation on Endothelial Cells and Leukocytes) and targetting chemokines which attract cells.
- IL-8 attracts neutrophils.
- Eotaxin attract Eosinophils
- MCP-1,2 and 3 attracts monocytes.
- However, knocking out 1 chemokine causes another to take over as one chemokine can cause the migration of multiple different inflammatory cell types
- This gives rise to redundancy in system so that Inflammatory Cell Migration can be maintained in inflammation even if there is a defect in the normal attractant molecule.
- It has been suggested that redundancy has evolved as a way to overcome mechanisms displayed by Microbes as a way to avoid the inflammatory response by inhibiting various molecular components
- This means that targeting specific chemoattractant Cytokines in order to resolve inflammation has been shown to have limited effectiveness as unaffected chemokines will carry out the function of the Inhibited Chemokine

# Some Inflammatory Mediators

- Redundancy is also seen in relation to the Cardinal Signs of Inflammation where multiple different mediators are responsible for a single sign of Inflammation
- Calor and Rubor can arise due to any mediator that causes Hyperaemia
- Tumor can arise due to any mediator that promotes cellular infiltration into infected tissue and increased vascular permeability
- Dolor can arise due to stimulation of nociceptive afferents and Functio Laesa can arise due to local tissue damage
- This means that redundancy here means that it is difficult to develop anti-inflammatory drugs as inhibition of the action of specific mediators will not produce anti-inflammatory effects as other mediators can carry out the same function and take over the role of the inhibited mediator

# Cellular Components of Inflammation

- Mast cells - Resident cell activated by IgE and complement. Release histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, PAF, IL-4, 5, 6.
- Neutrophils - First cells to migrate (ICAM-1). Phagocytosis and kills opsonised bacteria (C3b, CD14 receptors for endotoxins). Release leukotrienes, prostaglandins, free radicals, IL-1, TNFùõº and proteases.
- Eosinophils - Similar to neutrophils but have more granules. Have a role in parasitic infections and in late phase
asthma and allergic inflammation.
- Macrophages - Antigen presenting. Microbe killing. Granuloma formation, innate inflammation, angiogenesis, wound healing.
- Lymphocytes - B and T cells involved in immune mediated inflammation.
- Neurons - Involved in Neurogenic inflammation, release neuropeptides. Activated by bradykinin and 5-HT.
- Platelets - Involved in coagulation. Have low affinity IgE receptors. Release PAF Thromboxane A2.
- Endothelium - Important for mediating initial vascular changes seen in Inflammation

# Process of IgE Mediated Anaphylaxis

### IgE Activation of Mast Cells

1. Allergen is processed by APC, which is presented to Th2 Cell, which become activated
2. Th2 secrete IL-4 which causes B Cell Proliferation and differentiation into Plasma Cells that can synthesise and secrete IgE that is specific to the Ag
3. IgE binds to FcŒµRI on the Mast Cell via its Fc region, sensitising the Mast Cell
4. Upon Subsequent exposure to the Allergen, Ag binds to the Mast Cell with IgE bound to it
5. As the Ag is at least bivalent, the Ag binds to multiple IgE, causing crosslinking of the FcŒµRI, leading to increased Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Influx and hence, degranulation of Histamine and Pro-Inflammatory Mediators

![Screenshot 2022-01-31 at 11.54.07.png](%5BUMP2033%5D%20General%20Inflammation%20and%20Small%20Molecule%20%206cc6b27c83d84509ae426257c7e4c595/Screenshot_2022-01-31_at_11.54.07.png)

- Mast cells can be immunologically activated by crosslinking of FcŒµRI with IgE bound to it, following Ag exposure
- Non-Immunological Mast Cell activation can occur in response to drugs (E.g MRGPRX2 responds to Neuromuscular Blockers, as well as Opioids and Complement)
- Mast Cells release Histamine and other pro-inflammatory mediators from Granules in the acute setting (few minutes).
- In a more delayed setting (5-30 mins after activation), Mast Cells release Lipid Mediators, such as Leukotrienes and Prostaglandin D2
- After 30-60 mins, Mast Cells produce Cytokines that drive Inflammation (TNF-Œ±), Chemotractants (e.g IL-8 for Neurotrophils) and IgE Class Switching
- Depending on where the Mast Cells are found in the Body, different Pro-Inflammatory mediators can be produced, allowing for differential inflammatory responses in different tissues

### Wheal and Flair Reaction (Lewis Triple Reaction)

- This reaction is induced by an intradermal injection of Histamine
- This is characterised by initial rapid redness due to vasodilation and slightly later, swelling due to increased vascular permeability
- Wheal is swelling, and flair is redness.
- Histamine is shown to stimulate Vasodilation and experimentally, it can produce initial Hypotension which is rapidly compensated for, followed by a gradual drop in BP.
- Histamine has also been shown to increase vascular permeability, increasing Leg Volume (Due to Production of Oedema) following Administration of Histamine into the Leg

# Physiological Action of Histamine

### Smooth Muscle - Acts via H1

- Arteriolar and Arterial ‚Üí Relaxation
- Veins, Bronchial, Uterine and Gastrointestinal ‚Üí Contraction
- H1 Stimulation tends to cause smooth muscle contraction, except for in Arterial Structures

### Glands - Stimulates Secretion

- Adrenal medulla, Pancreas, Salivary gland, Lacrimal gland and Bronchial gland = H1
- Gastric = H2

### Heart - Acts to Increase CO

- +ve Chronotropy ‚Üí H2
- +ve Ionotropy ‚Üí H1 + H2
- Reduced AV Conduction ‚Üí H1
- Induction of Arrhythmias

### Endothelium

- Increased Vascular Permeability via stimulation of H1 on Endothelium, causing NO Release

### Neurotransmitter

1. ADH Release
2. Emesis
3. Consciousness
- Receptors involved in the role of Histamine to produce 1,2 and 3 are yet to be fully identified
- Presynaptical Modulation via H3

### Pain

- Histamine stimulates C fibres in the Skin to generate nociceptive signalling

---

# Histamine Receptors

- Dr Willis says ‚ÄòNeed to Known H1 Antagonists‚Äô
- H1 and H4 act via Gq to increase Intracellular [Ca¬≤‚Å∫], H2 act via Gs to increase cAMP and H3 act via Gi to decrease cAMP
- Histamine has a similar affinity for all these receptors
- First generation H1 antagonist: cross BBB. Will therefore cause you to fall asleep via sedation. Used in children.
- Example: diphenhydramine (sedative), chlorpheniramine (less sedative).
- Some of these are available over the counter for use in common allergic conditions like Hayfever
- Second generation H1 antagonist: cannot cross BBB.
- Example: astemizole, terfenadine, cetirizine.
- H1 antagonists are used for acute inflammatory responses.
- H2 antagonists are used to prevent acid secretion, so used for treatment of GI ulcers (superseded by PPI).
- Example: cimetidine, ranitidine.
- Pitolisant, thioperamide: H3 antagonist for excessive sleep.
- H4 Receptors may be involved in Itching

### Redundancy and Clinical Usage of Antihistamines

- Rosacea is caused by vasodilation of Superficial Blood Vessels, causing redness and swelling of the Skin
- Mediators that cause this have yet to be identified but the sudden flairs of Sx could be due to Histamine, with Px with this conditioned being advised to avoid foods that contain Histamine (e.g Chocolate and Beer)
- However, H1 Antagonists have not been shown to be effect in Reduced Sx associated with Rosacea
- This lack of clinical utility of H1 Antagonists here is likely due to Redundancy within the Inflammatory System, with Mast Cells producing various other mediators with similar effects to Histamine
- These stimulate Vasculature and Sensory Afferents which cause Vasodilation + Increased Vascular Permeability and Neuropeptide Release which may contribute to the Pathophysiology of Rosacea alongside Histamine and hence, can take over the function of Histamine when its effects are inhibited by H1 Antagonists

---

# Clinical Use of Histamine Antagonist

- Antihistamines work by preventing histamine effects via H1 receptors, where main effect is on vascular permeability.
- They are used in Insect bites, allergic rhinitis, drug hypersensitivity and urticaria, which are immediate inflammatory effects or result of anaphylactic hypersensitivity.
- Side effects associated with these drugs is usually due to binding to other Histamine receptors (notably in the CNS) and may be clinically beneficial (i.e. sedatives and anti-emetic).
- Some older drugs cross CNS and therefore cause dizziness, tinnitus, fatigue.
- Older drugs also have atropine-like actions (muscarine antagonists).
- Newer H1 Antagonists do not cross the CNS (e.g Astemizole, Terfenadine and Cetirizine) and hence, do not produce CNS Side effects (E.g Sedation)

---

# Anaphylaxis

- This can be caused by Immunological Mechanisms via IgE (Involving Systemic Ag like Pollen, Food Stuffs and Lactams) and Non-Immunological Mechanisms via Opioids and NSAIDs
- Both of these mechanisms eventually result in Mast Cell and Basophil Degranulation of ProInflammatory Mediators, particularly acting on the CVS, Lungs and Skin to give rise to Anaphylaxis
- Most common Allergens that can trigger Anaphylaxis are Foods (Peanuts, Nuts and Shellfish)

### Diagnosis

- If a known Allergen is not/cannot be identified, Dx can be made based on whether Px has:
1. Acute onset of illness involving Skin, Mucosal Tissue or both (usually Itching, Rashes or swelling)
2. Skin/Mucosal Sx accompanied with Respiratory Compromise (SOB or Wheeze/Stridor) or Hypotension
- If it is likely that a Px has been exposed to an allergen but this cannot be confirmed, 2 signs of Skin/Mucosal Involvement, Respiratory Compromise, Reduced BP and Persistent GI Sx (Abdominal Cramps or Vomiting) allows for Dx of Anaphylaxis
- If it is known that the Px has been exposed to a known allergen, Hypotension is enough to Dx anaphylaxis

---

# Anaphylaxis Management Protocol

1. Determine whether Anaphylaxis is present by looking at evidence of Allergen Exposure and Clinical Sx
2. Assess ABC and Manifestations in Skin and Oedema
3. If Anaphylaxis is Dx, administer IM Adrenaline to produce systemic vasoconstriction and bronchodilation to reduce Life-Threathening Sx
4. Call 999 to get Px to A&E, where Oxygen and IV Fluids may be administered
5. If Px improved, Supportive Therapy can be used to reduce Sx such as Inhaled Œ≤-Agonists to reduce Bronchospasm, Antihistamines to reduce Cutaneous Sx, Vasopressors to correct Hypotension and Corticosteroids to reduce Inflammation
6. In cases of Severe Anaphylaxis where IM Adrenaline has not produced improvement, IV Adrenaline can be administered - Px must be carefully monitored as IV Adrenaline can cause fatal Arrhythmias
