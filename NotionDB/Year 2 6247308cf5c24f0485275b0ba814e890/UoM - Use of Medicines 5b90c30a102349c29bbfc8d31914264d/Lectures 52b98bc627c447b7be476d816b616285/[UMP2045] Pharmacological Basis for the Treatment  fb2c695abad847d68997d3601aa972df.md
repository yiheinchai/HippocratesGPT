# [UMP2045] Pharmacological Basis for the Treatment of Thrombosis

# Haemostasis Vs Thrombosis

- Haemostasis: the physiological response of blood vessels to injury, to prevent blood loss, involves:
1. Vascular wall
2. Platelets
3. Coagulation cascade
- Thrombosis: inappropriately activated haemostasis, pathological

### Haemostasis

- Vascular Injury causes collagen and tissue factor within the Underlying Layers of the Blood Vessel to come into contact with the Blood
- This causes Neurogenic Local Vasoconstriction at the site of Damage (Vascular Spasm) to slow blood flow through the vessel at the site of injury
- Exposure of the blood to Vascular collagen causes Platelet activation, where platelets aggregate together and contract to form a Weak Primary Haemostatic Plug to further slow blood flow
- This in turn activates the clotting cascade and exposure to Vascular Tissue factor causes the direct activation of the Coagulation, which forms a Secondary Haemostatic Plug from Fibrin, which forms a Mesh to trap RBCs and Platelets which causes complete Haemostasis
- At the end of Haemostasis following Healing of Vascular Injury, Plasmin is activated which activates Fibrinolysis and Clot Degradation to restore normal blood flow

# Thrombosis

- Inappropriately activated haemostasis which is pathological
- Virchow’s Triad of Thrombosis → Predispose an individual to Thrombosis:
1. Hypercoagulable State (E.g Usually Proinflammatory)
2. Haemostasis/Circulatory Stasis (E.g Non-Laminar Flow such as Venous Insufficiency and AFib)
3. Vascular Wall/Endothelial Injury

### Drugs Targeted Thrombosis

- 3 Major Mechanisms:
1. Platelet function (Anti-platelets) → Prevent Platelet Aggregation and formation of Primary Haemostatic Plug
2. Coagulation cascade/fibrin formation (Anticoagulants) → Prevent formation of Secondary Haemostatic Plug
3. Thrombolysis (Fibrinolytics) → Increased degredation of Secondary Haemostatic Clots

### White - Arterial Clot

- In the Arterial System, which is under high pressure (High BP), there tends to be more platelet reactions (E.g Aggregation) than Coagulation System Activation/Fibrin Formation within the blood clots being formed than in Venous Clots
- In the Venous System, which is under low pressure (Low BP), there tends to be more activation of the Coagulation Cascade/Fibrin Formation than there are platelet reactions (E.g Aggregation) within the blood clots being formed than in Venous Clots
- Due to the Role of Platelet Activation and Aggregation within Arterial Clots, they tend to appear White under Microscopy whereas the role of the Coagulation System Activation which traps RBCs in the Fibrin Meshwork means that Venous Clots appear red under Microscopy
- Due to the role of Platelet Reactions within Arterial Clots, drugs that inhibit these reactions (E.g Aspirin and P2Y12 Antagonists) tend to be most effective to prevent the formation of Arterial Clots whilst the role of the Coagulation System (E.g Warfarin, Heparins and DOACs) within Venous Clots means that drugs that inhibit the Coagulation Cascade tend to be more effective in preventing Venous Clots form Forming

- As Atheroma formation within Atherosclerosis cause narrowing and hardening of the Arteries, this creates an abnormally shaped arterial lumen, leading to Non-Laminar Flow, increasing the risk of Thrombosis according to Virchow’s Triad
- When there is rupturing of Atheromata in Atherosclerosis, this can damage the Vascular Wall and its Endothelial Cells, increasing the risk of Thrombosis according to Virchow’s Triad

### Activation

- Rupturing of the Atherosclerotic Plaque causes platelets to adhere to vWF via Glycoprotein Receptors as vWF becomes exposed on the Endothelium due to Endothelial Damage
- This activates the platelets, causing the release of ADP and the Synthesis of TXA2 (Thromboxane) that both allow Platelets to bind to one another via ADP and Glycoprotein Receptors to cause Platelet Aggregation
- This activation causes the Coagulation Cascade to be amplified/occur at a faster rate on the surface of the Platelet as Damage to Blood Vessels causes exposure of Phospholipids which directly activate the Coagulation Cascade to form Thrombin
- Aspirin Inhibits the Synthesis of Prostaglandins from Arachidonic Acid, Clopidogrel blocks P2Y12 ADP Receptors on the Platelet Surface to prevent Platelet Aggregation
- Dipyridamole inhibits TXA2 Synthesis to prevent Platelet Aggregation
- Glycoprotein IIb/IIIA Inhibitors like Abciximab to prevent Platelet Aggregation
- Direct Thrombin Inhibitors are also available but are rarely used clinically

# Atherosclerosis

- Irreversible COX-2 inhibition:
1. Aspirin → Prevents formation of Prostaglandins from Arachidonic Acid to prevent Thromboxane Synthesis to inhibit Platelet Aggregation
- ADP (P2Y12 receptor) inhibitors → Tend to be used in Secondary Prevention of CVD that occur due to rupturing of Atheromata in Atherosclerosis which can then circulate to cause Ischaemia elsewhere (E.g Stroke, MI)
1. Clopidogrel
2. Ticagrelor
3. Prasugrel
- Used for secondary prevention

### Antiplatelet Use in Atherosclerosis

| Clinical Event | Antiplatelet Regimen |
| --- | --- |
| Stroke | Aspirin 300mg then Clopidogrel 75 mg daily |
| Transient Ischaemic Attack | Aspirin 300mg then Clopidogrel 75 mg daily |
| Unstable Angina | Aspirin and Clopidogrel 300mg then 75mg daily. Intravenous GPIIb/IIIA inhibitor for high
risk angioplasty/sten |
| Acute Myocardial Infarction | Aspirin and Clopidogrel 300mg then 75mg daily |
| Post-Stent insertion (angioplasty | Aspirin 75mg daily lifelong
+ Clopidogrel 75mg daily for 4 weeks (bare metal stent) or 12 months (drug eluting stent) |

---

# Thrombolysis

- Fibrinolysis: Enzymatic breakdown of fibrin in blood clots by plasmin to break down Blood Clots
- This is used to minimise the Ischaemia/Damage caused by Thrombosis whilst it has formed
- Plasmin digests fibrin to free trapped RBCs and Platelets to break down the clot
- Tissue Plasminogen Activator/TPA (Streptokinase) or Alteplase converts Plasminogen into Plasmin, which can then degrade the Fibrin Meshwork of Clots to degrade the Clots

### STEMI - Thrombolysis

- Thrombolytics can be used to Rx a STEMI where a Thrombus forms on the side of the Vascular Lumen and completely occludes blood flow through the Coronary Vessel to cause Ischaemia of the Myocardium supplied by that vessel
- Thrombolysis is commonly used when it is not possible to perform an Angioplasty (E.g Not enough time to insert Angioplasty/Reach Dr) where a Catheter is inserted into the Coronary Vessels and dilated to slowly open the Occluded Coronary Artery to restore blood flow to the Myocardium
- Giving a Px Aspirin or Streptokinase alone to Rx a STEMI produce a reduction in mortality by a similar degree however, when administered together, Aspirin and Streptokinase cause a significant reduction in mortality following an STEMI

![Screenshot 2022-03-18 at 10.20.31.png](%5BUMP2045%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%20fb2c695abad847d68997d3601aa972df/Screenshot_2022-03-18_at_10.20.31.png)

### Acute Ischaemic Stroke - Thrombolysis

- An Ischaemic Stroke is caused by the Occlusion of a Cerebral Artery by a Thrombus
- Thrombolytics have to be given rapidly following the onset of Stroke Sx (First 4.5 hrs) because as the time from the Onset of Stroke Sx increases, the effectiveness of Thrombolysis decreases so that after 4.5 hours, the risk associated with Thrombolysis (E.g Major Haemorrhage) outweight the potential benefits of reducing Cerebral Ischaemia

# Coagulation Cascade

- Cascade of proteolytic activation of inert zymogens
- Final common pathway involves the activation of Factor X, which activates thrombin, catalysing the conversion of soluble fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin which polymerises into fibrin strands whilst also catalysing Platelet Activation and Adhesion
- The Rate of Reaction of the Coagulation Cascade is increased if it is carried out on phospholipid rich surface such as platelets/microparticles
- Fibrin strands create a meshwork with fused platelets to form the stable secondary haemostatic plug which is significantly stronger than the Primary Haemostatic Plug (Just made of Activated and Aggregated Platelets with no supporting framework/mesh)
- The Intrinsic Pathway is activated by damage to the Vascular Endothelium whereas the Extrinsic Pathway is activated by Tissue Factor which is exposed following Vascular Damage
- Prothrombin Time measures the Extrinsic Pathways and Partial Thromboplastin Time measures the activity of the Intrinsic Pathway
- These can be used to help Dx Haemophilia (Prolonged Bleeding Time) or specific Coagulation Factor Deficiencies but also to monitor Px who are on Pharmacological Therapies that alter Clotting and hence, bleeding time (e.g Warfarin)

---

# Red Clot/Venous Low Pressure

- Rx by:
1. Warfarins
2. Heparins
3. DOACs
- Within Veins, Prolonged Immobility can cause Blood to pool within Veins of the Lower Limbs, causing Venous Stasis here which increases the risk of a Thrombus forming here (Deep Vein Thrombosis), notably in the leg according to Virchow’s Triad
- Due to the action of the Skeletal Muscle Pump surrounding Veins, these DVT can often embolise and travel through the circulation where they can form a Pulmonary Embolism within the Lungs, which can cause Pulmonary Infarction and eventually, death

![Screenshot 2022-03-18 at 10.22.13.png](%5BUMP2045%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%20fb2c695abad847d68997d3601aa972df/Screenshot_2022-03-18_at_10.22.13.png)

- As Warfarin Inhibits the formation of Coagulation Factors within the Extrinsic Pathway, it prolongs the Prothrombin Time, the duration fo which can be measured to monitor Warfarin Therapy
- Haemophilia A Prolongs Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time

![Screenshot 2022-03-18 at 10.22.43.png](%5BUMP2045%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%20fb2c695abad847d68997d3601aa972df/Screenshot_2022-03-18_at_10.22.43.png)

# Warfarin

- Traditionally most commonly used
- Dicoumarol first isolated from sweet clover silage, caused haemorrhagic disease in cattle
- Synthetic version named after patent holder Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation Coumarin
- Prolongs prothrombin time (clinical measure of international normalised ratio, PT in Px:PT normal) due to inhibition of Factors in the Extrinsic Pathway
- It is a Vitamin K Antagonist that inhibits Vitamin K Reductase and hence, prevents the formation of Factor II, VII, IX and X as Vitamin K is a cofactor required for the synthesis of these coagulation factors within the Liver

![Screenshot 2022-03-18 at 10.23.48.png](%5BUMP2045%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%20fb2c695abad847d68997d3601aa972df/Screenshot_2022-03-18_at_10.23.48.png)

![Screenshot 2022-03-18 at 10.24.03.png](%5BUMP2045%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%20fb2c695abad847d68997d3601aa972df/Screenshot_2022-03-18_at_10.24.03.png)

### Pharmacokinetics

- Initially, Warfarin can act as a pro-coagulant as it also inhibits protein C and S (physiological anticoagulatory factors) which prevents anticoagulation pathways from being activated
- Therefore, when commencing Warfarin Therapy, A Px needs a Loading Dose to overcome this initial pro-coagulant effect of Warfarin so that the Anticoagulant effects of Warfarin quickly appear
- Avoiding this Procoagulant State due to Warfarin, Px are often given LMWH or Heparin which acts as an Anticoagulant to oppose Warfarin’s Procoagulant effects
- CYP450 Enzymes are found in the Liver and Warfarin is susceptible to Drug Interactions as it is metabolised by CYP450 Enzymes so CYP450 inducers/inhibitors affect dosing needed to achieve a specific level of Plasma Warfarin as Warfarin as Varying Levels of CYP450 Alter the rate at which Warfarin is metabolised and hence, cleared within the Body
- As CYP450 Inhibition Increases, Warfarin Clearance via Metabolism decreases, so a smaller Dose of Warfarin is required to achieve a Desired Plasma [Warfarin]
- Loading Dose and general dosage for Warfarin to achieve Anticoagulant Effects is also dependent on Genetic Polymorphisms in CYP450 as these Polymorphisms alter the Ability of CYP450 to Metabolise and hence, Clear the Warfarin within the Body
- Warfarin is used in the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation where Non-Laminar Blood Flow from the Atria into the Ventricles predisposes an individual to Thrombosis according to Virchow’s Triad
- Warfarin is less used nowadays as it has a narrow therapeutic window and hence, toxicity can be easily achieved when Plasma [Warfarin] slightly increases
- Therapeutic Window of Warfarin assessed using INR is between 2-3, when INR is greater than 3, Risk of Intracranial Haemorrhages or Ischaemic Stroke increases as a Px is Hypocoagulable and an INR of Less than 2 indicates that Warfarin is having a very minimal therapeutic effect on Reducing Coagulability of Blood

# Evaluation of Warfarin

### Limitations

1. Narrow therapeutic window meaning toxicity can easily occur
2. Requires monitoring via Regular Measurements of INR and dose adjustment (to keep INR in desired range of 2-3) due to the susceptibility of Warfarin to Drug Drug Interactions
3. Metabolised by CYP2C9
- Enzyme inhibitors potentiate effects of warfarin by decreasing its plasma clearance
- Enzyme inducers reduce effects of warfarin by increasing its plasma clearance

### Advantage

1. Reversible anticoagulation via Vitamin K Administration
2. They can be administered orally

---

# Heparin

- Antithrombin III activator
- AT III inactivates Thrombin and Xa to inhibit the Final Common pathway to reduce Fibrin Formation whilst also reducing fibrin formation directly via Thrombin inhibition
- It contains a pentasaccharide sequence potentiates action of antithrombin III following the binding of Heparin to Antithrombin
- Enhances inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa via Potentiation of the activity of Antithrombin III
- Unfractionated heparin (UH) – large, charged glycoaminoglycans derived from bovine
- Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) – synthetic - now more commonly used as it does not need regular, routine monitoring unlike UH.
- Only potentiates inhibition of factor Xa and hence, inhibits the Final Common Pathway but does not directly inhibit Thrombin Activity

![Screenshot 2022-03-18 at 10.28.55.png](%5BUMP2045%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%20fb2c695abad847d68997d3601aa972df/Screenshot_2022-03-18_at_10.28.55.png)

### Limitations

1. Need to be administered via Subcutaneous or intravenous injections
2. Bleeding risk
- UH can be reversed with protamine sulphate
- LMWH e.g. dalteparin, enoxaparin, tinzaparin do not have a reversal agent
1. Osteoporosis with long term use
2. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia due to Heparin stimulating an Ab response against Platelets

# Direct Oral Anticoagulant (DOACs)

1. Factor **Xa** inhibition → Inhibit Final Common Pathway Activity
- Api**xa**ban
- Rivaro**xa**ban
- Edoxaban
1. Thrombin inhibition → Inhibit Fibrin Formation
- Dabigatran
- There is no need for therapeutic monitoring unlike that seen in Warfarin as they are more stable in their Pharmacokinetics, more reliable in their Mechanism of Action and less susceptible to Drug-Drug Interactions

![Screenshot 2022-03-18 at 10.31.06.png](%5BUMP2045%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%20fb2c695abad847d68997d3601aa972df/Screenshot_2022-03-18_at_10.31.06.png)

### Efficacy and Safety

- In Px with AF, the Efficacy of DOACs in preventing a Stroke is greater than that provided by Warfarin
- In Comparison with Warfarin, DOAC have a lower risk of Major Haemorrhage and Intracranial Bleedings but they have a higher risk of GI Bleeds

|  | Route | Monitoring | Bridging To Prevent Initial Hypercoagulability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Warfarin | Oral | Required via INR Assessment due to Narrow Therapeutic Window and Susceptibility to Drug-Drug Interactions | Yes → LWMH Must be administered alongside Warfarin initially (First Few Days) to prevent Initial Hypercoagulability due to Protein C and S Inhibition before Inhibition of Coagulation Factors |
| Low Molecular Weight Heparin | Subcutaneous | Not needed | Yes |
| Direct Oral Anticoagulant | Oral | Not needed | Not needed |

# COVID-19 and Thrombolysis

- Inflammation is a pro-coagulant state
- Thrombosis in the form of pulmonary embolism is responsible for a significant amount of morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19
- Instead of these Pulmonary Emboli forming from DVTs in the Legs, these form via the aggregation of Microthrombi in the Pulmonary Circulation (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/DIC)
- Thromboprophylaxis is given in Hospital where Px are given LMWH to prevent DVTs from forming due to Immobilisation/Reduced Movement of Px when in Hospital, which predisposes Px to forming DVTs in their Legs
- Markers of Thrombosis are used to assess prognosis and to guide management (d-dimer, fibrinogen → Breakdown products of Blood Clots which are used to indicate the presence of Thromboses) → As d-dimer levels increase, Prognosis worsens

---

# Summary

- Thrombosis is pathological inappropriate activation of
haemostasis
- Three main mechanisms of targeting thrombosis:
antiplatelets, anticoagulants, thrombolysis
- Importance of understanding the mechanism of action for
treatment of adverse effects
