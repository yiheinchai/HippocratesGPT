# [UMP2023] Pharmacological Basis For The Treatment of Psychosis

# Psychosis and Symptom Classification

### Psychosis

- These sx also occur in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder.
- Characterised by Delusions (Linking of representations with one another in the absence of external dependency), hallucinations (impaired ability to classify representations as internally or externally generated) and lack of insight.
- These are characterised by dysfunction in higher order processing regions such as the Prefrontal Cortex, Thalamus, Basal Ganglia, Hippocampus etc.
- Studies of Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (Thalamus and Hippocampus) shown dysfunction of neuronal connections between and within these regions in Psychosis, which may explain cognitive deficits that appear in Psychosis (Memory Defects, Attention Defecit and Language Disturbance)

### Symptom Classification

- Initially defined as Dementia Praecox, defined by Catatonia (Excessive/Inhibited Motor Activity), Hebephrenia (Inappropriate Emotional Responses) and Dementia Paranoides (Delusions of Grandeur)
- It was later Termed Schizophrenia, based on Positive and Negative Symptoms (Does not indicate Split Personality but indicates effects of Schizophrenia on Cognition)
- Now defined by DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder)

| Positive (Type 1) - GOF (False Perceptions/Beliefs) | Negative (Type 2) - LOF of Higher Order Brain Function (Lack of Normal Behaviour) | Cognitive Impairment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auditory Hallucinations | Lack of Drive/Avolition and Ananergia (Lack of Energy) | Impaired Working Memory  |
| Delusions | Social withdrawal  | Perseveration (Repetitive Behaviour) |
| Thought Disorder | Motor Disturbances (Catatonia) - Commonly Disorganised Speech and Abnormal Emotional Motor Responses of the Voice and Face | Attention Deficit |
| Thought Broadcasting |  |  |
| Psychomotor Agitation  |  |  |

# Schizophrenia

### Schizophrenia

- 1% prevalence
- Onset: late teens/early 20s.
- 40% attempt suicide

### Causes

1. Genetic: 17% dizygotic twins, 48% monozygotic twins. Children have a 40% chance if both parents are Schizophrenic
- Recently studies show that it is polygenetic, with many susceptibility genes and shared risk alleles with Depression, ADHD, Autism and BPD
- Key Susceptibility Genes (Neuroregulin, Dysbindin, DISC1, PDE4B) have multiple varied neuronal functions so therefore, Schizophrenia cannot be attributed to a single type of neuronal dysfunction
1. Viral Infection During Gestation
2. Developmental disorder (E.g High BP in Mother in Gestation or Mean Intracranial Volume, characterised by Reduced Grey:White Matter over time)
- There is no simple biochemical explanation for Schizophrenia that can be identified by Biomarkers
- It is currently suggested that Schizophrenia arises due to a combination of a genetic predisposition and environmental stresses that causes Schizophrenia to manifest as Psychosis

### Neurotransmitters

- Neurotransmitters involved in Schizophrenia have been identified by identification of drugs that can cause Psychotic effects and which neurotransmitters they target
- Dopamine receptors: Targeted by amphetamine
- Serotonin receptors (5HT-2A Notably): Targeted by LSD
- Glutamate receptor: Targeted by PCP (phencyclidine - Initially used as an Anaesthetic)

### Dopamine Receptors

- There are 2 Families of DA Receptors, characterised as
1. D1 like receptors: D1, D5
2. D2 like receptors: D2, D3, D4,
- They are both found presynaptically and postsynaptically in high and low affinity forms, with High affinity receptors being involved in the development Psychosis
- D2 like receptors are affected/overstimulated in Schizophrenia.

# Schizophrenia Hypotheses

### Dopamine Hypothesis

- Raised DA levels cause Psychosis and Lower DA levels reduce Psychotic Sx
- There is no direct evidence for this hypothesis as there is no direct correlation between Blood DA/Urine DA Metabolite Levels and Schizophrenia - All evidence is indirect from the effects of Drugs that impact DA metabolism

| Amphetamine | Drugs release dopamine and produce symptoms identical to +ve symptoms of Schizophrenia and exacerbate Schizophrenia. These are blocked by antipsychotics (D2 Antagonists) |
| --- | --- |
| D2-Like Dopamine Receptor Agonists | Drugs like Apomorphine and Bromocriptine (used in Parkinson‚Äôs disease) produce +ve symptoms of Schizophrenia |
| Reserpine | Antihypertensive drug that depletes
dopamine from synaptic vesicles centrally and NA from Synaptic Vesicles peripherally by acting on VMAT2 |
| D2-Like Dopamine Receptor Antagonists | ‚Üì +ve symptoms of Schizophrenia and
amphetamine-induced behavioural
changes |

### Dopaminergic Pathways in the Brain (Revision)

1. VTA ‚Üí Prefrontal Cortex, Piriform Cortex and Cingulate + Entorhinal Cortex (Mesocortical - Attention)
2. VTA ‚Üí Ventral Striatum and Amygdala (Mesolimbic - Reward and Reinforcement)
3. Substantia Nigra ‚Üí Corpus Striatum (Nigrostriatal - Motor)
4. Arcuate Nucleus of the Hypothalamus ‚Üí Median Eminence (Tuberoinfundibular Pathway - Inhibits Prolactin Release)
- Mesocortical and Mesolimbic Pathways are involved in Schizophrenia and the Nigrostriatal and Tuberoinfundibular Pathways are commonly affects in the Rx of Schizophrenia to produce Side Effects

### Working Hypothesis

- Hyperactivity of the Mesolimbic Pathway is thought to produce positive Sx of Schizophrenia whereas the Hypoactivity of the Mesocortical Pathway is thought to produce Negative Sx of Schizophrenia
- VTA Projects to Nucleus Accumbens and stimulates D2R on GABAergic Neurons that project to the Thalamus
- Therefore, Hyperactivity of the Mesolimbic Pathway produces overstimulation of D2 Receptors in the Nucleus Accumbens, Disinhibiting the Thalamus
- This increases Glutamatergic Outflow from the Thalamus onto the Prefrontal Cortex to decrease sensory filtering in the Prefrontal Cortex to produce +ve Sx of Schizophrenia
- Typical Antipsychotics tend to Antagonise D2 in the Mesolimbic Pathway to reduce Prefrontal Cortex stimulation and hence, Rx +ve Sx
- Hypofrontality (via Reduced NMDA-R Stimulation of Pyramidal Cells due to Reduced Mesocortical Activity) reduces Glutamatergic Output to the Nucleus Accumbens, reducing its inhibition
- This further excites the Nucleus Accumbens and Disinhibits the Thalamus to further decrease sensory filtering to enhance Positive Sx of Schizophrenia
- NMDA-R Dysfunction/Hypostimulation reduces Glutamatergic Stimulation of GABAergic Interneurons that project to Pyramidal Cells
- This increases Glutamatergic Outflow of Pyramidal Cells to VTA Neurons that project to the Nucleus Accumbens, increasing the Activity of the Mesolinbic Pathway to exacerbate positive Sx
- There is also increased Glutamatergic Outflow from Pyramidal Cells to GABAergic Interneurons which project to VTA Neurons that project to the Prefrontal Cortex, further inhibiting the Mesocortical Pathway to exacerbate Negative Sx
- The Raphe Nuclei give off 5-HTergic Projections to the Cerebral Cortex, stimulating 5-HT2A which contribute to Positive, but mainly Negative Sx of Schizophrenia

# Typical Drugs (1st Generation Neuroleptics)

- Clinical Efficacy of First Generation Antipsychotics/Neuroleptics is positively correlated with their affinity for D2 in their Antagonism
- To exert clinical effects, these drugs often need to bind to around 80% of D2 Receptors. This high occupancy necessity means that side effects on other DA Pathways in the Brain are very common
- 1st Gen Neuroleptics target the +ve Sx of Schizophrenia but not the -ve Sx
- They are called Typical as they all have a similar profile of side effects

### Phenothiazines

- These are all modifications of Promazine

| Chlorpromazine | Aliphatic. Low D2 affinity. Nonselective (affect ùõº1, H1 and
mAChR antagonist) so produces side effects of Hypotension, Sedation and Autonomic Effects. |
| --- | --- |
| Thioridazine (Piperidine) | Strong mAChR Antagonist |
| Trifluoperazine/Fluphenazine (Piperazine) | Higher affinity (depot administration, esters of decanoate/ethanate). |

### Thioxanthines

| Flupenthixol |  |
| --- | --- |

### Butyrophenones

| Haloperidol | Highest D2 Affinity |
| --- | --- |
- There is a Good correlation between antipsychotic binding affinity with
clinical effect.
- Depot administration is when a medication is injected and the active drug is slowly released over time to reduce frequency of administration to improve medication adherence and consistency
- Whilst they commonly produce sedation, this is independent of antipsychotic activity of these drugs
- Some (but not all Px) respond to these drugs and are rapid in their effects in Acute Psychosis
- However, these drugs become localised to fat stores within the Body which disrupts their pharmacokinetics

# On and Side Effects of Typical Drugs

### Collateral On-Effects/Side Effects on the D2 Expressing DA Pathways

- Mesocorticolimbic tracts: neuroleptics prevent hallucinations
- Nigrostriatal system: neuroleptics induce movement disorders (EPS/Extrapyramidal Side Effects).
- Tuberoinfundibular system (hypothalamic): neuroleptics cause hyperprolactinaemia

### Side Effects of Typical Neuroleptics

- Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)
1. Parkinsonian-like: akinesia, rigidity, tremor.
2. Dystonia: head/neck/trunk muscle spasm, oculogyric crisis (prolonged involuntary upwards deviation of the eyes), glossospasm, torticolis (twisted and tilted neck) - Notably pronounced in individuals with high muscle mass
3. Tardive dyskinesia: involuntary face/tongue/limb movement - This can sometimes persist after the drug has been eliminated due to upregulation of D2 Receptors caused by the D2 Antagonist
4. Akathesia: involuntary motor restlessness.
- These EPS are reduced via the administration of Muscarinic Antagonists
- Some 1st Gen Neuroleptics have intrinsic Anti-Muscarinic Activity that reduces EPS
- Hyperprolactinaemia: gynaecomastia/galactorrhea/pseudopre nancy.
- Sedation: Due to H1 receptor antagonism - Can be useful in Schizophrenic Individuals having aggressive episodes.
- Autonomic effects:
1. Orthostatic hypertension: ùõº1 adrenoceptor block.
2. Dry mouth
3. mydriasis/blurred vision/glaucoma
4. xerophthalmia
5. constipation
6. urinary hesitancy (mAch receptor block).
- 2-6 are due to Anti-Muscarinic Effects
- Aplastic anaemia (chlorpromazine).
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome - Characterised by Severe Parkinson‚Äôs/Catatonic Sx and Hyperthermia, Variable Hypertension and Rhabdomyolysis (Dx as presence of Urinary Creatine Phosphokinase)

---

# Positive Vs Negative Symptoms

- Typical/1st Gen Neuroleptics as DA receptor antagonists ‚Üì +ve  symptoms that arise due to Hyperdopaminergia in the Nucleus Accumbens (Contains more D2 than D1) within the Mesolimbic Pathway.
- This therapy doesn‚Äôt work for all Schizophrenics
- Typical neuroleptics do not ‚Üì -ve Sx as they do not treat Hypodopaminergic in the Mesocortical Pathway to the Prefrontal Cortex (Expresses Much More D1 than D2)
- -ve Sx arise due to Hypofrontality Syndrome in the Prefrontal Cortex and might be seen in BPD, Major Depressive Disorder and ADHD
- Therefore, Hypofrontality Syndrome can impact cortical and subcortical projections to the Striatum, Limbic Areas and Midbrain, producing Negative Sx via Inhibition of Glutamatergic Projections from these areas to wider Cortical Areas (Glutamate Hypothesis of Negative Sx of Schizophrenia)

---

# Atypical Drugs (2nd Generation Neuroleptics)

- These act to reduce Positive and Negative Sx of Schizophrenia
- They occupy only 30% of D2 receptors to produce Clinical Effects (Likely due to 5HT2A Antagonism) and hence, have a higher efficacy than 1st Gen Neuroleptics and produce fewer EPS associated with Nigrostriatal Inhibition

### Dibenzazepine Derivatives

| Clozapine | Fewer EPS as there are 5-HT2 Receptors on DA Substantia Nigra Neurons which normally inhibit DA Release. This means that 5-HT2 Antagonist increases DA release from the SNc onto the Striatum, opposing the effects of D2 Antagonism here that give rise to EPS. It targets -ve and +ve symptoms via 5-HT2R Antagonism (Not Anti-Psychotic Alone) mainly but also with some D2 Antagonism respectively. It is shown to be effective in Px with Psychosis resistant to 1st Gen Neuroleptics. It produces less tardive dyskinesia. |
| --- | --- |
| Olanzapine |  |
| Quetiapine |  |

### Benzisocazole Derivatives

| Risperidone |  |
| --- | --- |
| Paliperidone | Primary Active Metabolite of Risperidone |

### Third Generation

| Ziprasidone |  |
| --- | --- |

### Binding of Typical and Atypicals

| Drug | D1 | D2 | 5HT2A |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chlorpromazine | ++ | ++ | ++ |
| Haloperidol |  | +++ | + |
| Atypicals | + | + | ++ |

---

# Side Effects of Atypical Drugs

- Very Few EPS, Muscarinic and HT1 side effects than 1st Generation Neuroleptics
- Hyperprolactinaemia: gynaecomastia/galactorrhea/pseudopre nancy.
- Autonomic effects - Orthostatic hypotension due to ùõº1 adrenoceptor block.
- They also produce new, additional side-effects such as:
- ECG prolongation: QT interval.
- Metabolic effects (which produce contraindications):
1. Weight gain (especially olanzapine).
2. Hypercholesterolemia
3. Type II diabetes
- Sialorrhoea (dribbling)
- Agranulocytosis (in 1% of patients)/leukopenia

---

# Potency Issues

### Chlorpromazine

- Low affinity/potency at D2
receptor ‚Üí high dose required to produce clinical effects
- Low selectivity ‚Üí There are greater non-DA side effects associated with its usage such as H1 sedation, a1 hypotension, mAch anti-muscarinic effects
- Minimal motor effects due to anti-muscarinic effects

### Haloperidol

- High affinity/potency at D2 receptor ‚Üí low dose required for clinical effects
- High selectivity ‚Üí Fewer non-DA side effects little or no H1 sedation, a1 hypotension, mAch anti-muscarinic effects
- But, EPS and endocrine effects at D2 pathways remain due to strong D2 Antagonism impacting other DA Pathways in the Brain

### Atypicals

- Clozapine ‚Äì behaves like low potency drug (no EPS due to anti-muscarinic effects)
- Risperidone ‚Äì behaves like high affinity drug, with minimal non-DA side-effects (but significant motor effects)

---

# 3rd Generation Antipsychotics

### Aripiprazole

1. D2 partial agonist: high affinity/low intrinsic activity/efficacy
- Depending on what concentration of endogenous agonist (e.g. dopamine) these partial agonists can be either inhibitory or stimulatory.
- At low endogenous concentrations (Mesocortical Pathway), will act as an agonist by increasing D2 stimulation (will stimulate unstimulated D2 receptors in this hypoactive pathway).
- At higher endogenous concentrations (Mesolimbic), will behave like an antagonist as it has a lower efficacy than Dopamine and hence, by occupying D2 Receptors in the Mesolimbic Pathway, it will lower the overall response produced at the receptors and hence, the activity of the Pathway
1. 5HT1A agonist - 5HT1A are found presynaptically and are inhibitory and hence, Agonism here will reduce 5-HT Release
2. 5HT2A antagonist
- This means that reduce 5-HT release and 5-HT2A Antagonism means there will be reduced 5-HT Signalling, reducing Negative Sx of Schizophrenia

### Pros

- Few EPS: no difference from placebo.
- Little weight gain (fewer metabolic effects than 2nd Generation Neuroleptics).
- Few CV (Q-TT) abnormalities.
- Apparently safe in overdose.

### Cons

- Hyperprolactinaemia
- Hypercholesterolaemia
- In some cases, it can cause Akathisia (Restlessness)

---

# Therapeutic Summary

- Most antipsychotics have similar efficacy (except possibly clozapine, which is higher).
- Choice individualised based on side effect profile and how well it is tolerated.
- Atypicals now first-line drugs.
- Typicals still preferred if depot preparation required due to compliance issues or atypical contraindications due to metabolic side-effects of atypicals.
- Typicals still most widely prescribed globally due to low cost and easier availability.
