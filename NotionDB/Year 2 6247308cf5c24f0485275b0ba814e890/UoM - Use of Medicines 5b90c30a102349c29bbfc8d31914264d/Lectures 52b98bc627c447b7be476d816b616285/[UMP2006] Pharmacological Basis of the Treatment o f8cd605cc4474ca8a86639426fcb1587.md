# [UMP2006] Pharmacological Basis of the Treatment of High Blood Pressure

# Blood Pressure

- BP is normally distributed across the population, with most people having a BP of around 120/80 mmHg, but a significant quantity of people having a BP either side of this value
- NICE - Every 2 mmHg increase in BP from 0/0 mmHg is associated with a 7% increase risk of mortality from Ischaemic Heart Disease - As BP Increases, so does risk of IHD
- Hypertension = 140/90>BP
- This cut off point is defined at the BP value where benefits of reducing BP on the risk of developing Cardiovascular Disease like Ischaemic Heart Disease outweighs any harm that can be produced in lowering this BP artificially (Intervention justifies Risk)

# Causes of Hypertension

1. Essential/Primary
- No known cause/Idiopathic
- Around 90% of Px with Hypertension
1. Secondary
- Hypertension with an identifiable mechanism (E.g Phaeochromocytoma, Primary Aldosteronism, Cushing's Syndrome)
- Phaeochromocytoma - Tumour of the Chromaffin Cells of the Adrenal Gland. This causes increased Release of A into Circulation, which mimics the action of the SNS and leading to α1-Mediated Vasoconstriction and Positive Chronotropy and Inotropy, increasing TPR, HR and SV and hence, increasing BP
- Around 10% of Px with Hypertension
- Usually managed by giving drugs to manage hypertension and lower BP whilst simultaneously treating the primary cause

---

# Determinants of Blood Pressure

- BP = CO x TPR and as CO = SV X HR
- BP = SV X HR X TPR
- Goal for Rx for Hypertension is to bring BP back down to normal.
- This could be by targeting the Heart (Reducing SV or HR - Negative Inotropy or Chronotropy) or Vasculature (TPR - Vasodilation)

---

# K⁺ Channel Openers

- E.g Minoxidil
- This blocks the action of ATP on Kₐₜₚ expressed on Vasculature
- These are sensitive to Intracellular [ATP]
- They consist of a K⁺ channel subunit (Through which ions flow) and a Sulfonylruea Receptor (Binds ATP)
- When ATP is present, Kₐₜₚ channels are closed, trapping K⁺ within the cell to depolarise the membrane, to open Ca²⁺ channels to allow Ca²⁺ influx
- Minoxidil binds to the Sulfonylurea Receptor to prevent ATP binding, opening the K⁺ channel to allow for K⁺ efflux
- This hyperpolarises the membrane, causing Ca²⁺ Channels to close, preventing Ca²⁺ influx and the subsequent Vasoconstriction due to Vascular Smooth Muscle Contraction (They produce Vasodilation)

---

# Ca²⁺ Channel Blockers

- E.g Nife**dipine** or Amlodipine
- These block Voltage Gated Ca²⁺ Channel (Usually opened due to depolarised Vm), preventing Ca²⁺ influx into Vascular Smooth Muscle, preventing contraction and hence producing Vasodilation

---

# Nitrovasodilators

- E.g Sodium Nitroprusside
- These break down in the blood stream to form NO, which then diffuses into Vascular Smooth Muscle (NO Donor)
- NO then activates Guanylate Cyclase to convert GTP into cGMP, which enters/activates Secondary Messenger Intracellular signalling systems to produce Smooth Muscle Relaxation

![Screenshot 2021-10-20 at 13.42.36.png](%5BUMP2006%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%20f8cd605cc4474ca8a86639426fcb1587/Screenshot_2021-10-20_at_13.42.36.png)

# Smooth Muscle Vasodilators

### Thiazide Diuretics

- E.g Bendroflumethiazide
- They lower BP but not through diuresis (AKA Reduction of Circulating Blood Volume, which influences CO, due to increased diuresis)
- When Thiazide diuretics are given to a Px, there is an initial drop in ECV (Effective Circulating Volume), but this then increases back to what it was before the Thiazide was administered, despite BP remaining lower even when ECV is restored
- They are thought to cause direct vasodilation via an unknown mechanism but there are 3 hypothesis suggested currently:
1. Reduced Ca²⁺ entry into Vascular Smooth Muscle due to Na⁺ depletion from increased Diuresis
2. Synthesis of Vasodilating Prostaglandins
3. Opening of K⁺ Channels, hyperpolarising the smooth muscle which closes Ca²⁺ Channels and leads to Vascular Smooth Muscle Relaxation

### Hydralazine

- Causes vasodilation via an unknown mechanism
- It acts only on Arteriolar Smooth Muscle but not on Arterial Smooth Muscle
- As Arterioles are the main resistance vessels, vasodilation of Arterioles has the most significant effect on reducing BP
- They might activate Guanylate Cyclase to produce cGMP-Mediated relaxation of Arteriolar Smooth Muscle
- The reduced BP caused by Arteriolar Vasodilation activates the Baroreceptor Reflex, to cause a reflex tachycardia (to try and restore BP back to Baseline Hypertensive level) and RAAS Activation
- Reflex Tachycardia is produced as Hydralazine does not act on the heart so does not cause a reduction in HR or SV

---

# Vascular Tone

- Hypertension is characterised by an increase in TPR
- The amount of Peripheral Resistance is dependent on the level of α1-AR mediated Vasoconstriction, stimulated by the SNS
- Therefore, by blocking α1-AR or the SNS, Vasoconstriction can be blocked, which reduces TPR and hence, BP
1. Vasomotor Centre in the Medulla signal to Neurons within the Spinal Cord, which project to Preganglionic Sympathetic Neurons, which synapse in SNS Autonomic Ganglia
2. This activates Vasomotor Postganglionic SNS Neurons, which releases NA onto the surface of Arterioles, stimulating α1-AR, producing Vasoconstriction
- Firing rate of the Postganglionic SNS neuron is directly proportional to the quantity of NA that is released onto the Arterioles and hence, the degree of α1 activation and subsequent vasoconstriction
- α1 Antagonists like Prazosin prevent α1-AR Mediated Vasoconstriction produced by NA, causing Vasodilation
- Ganglion Blockers like Hexamethonium block Ganglion nAChR, preventing excitation of the Postganglionic SNS neuron, reducing the firing rate of the Postganglionic Neuron which reduces the release of NA and the degree of α1-mediated Vasoconstriction that occurs

![Screenshot 2021-10-20 at 13.53.59.png](%5BUMP2006%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%20f8cd605cc4474ca8a86639426fcb1587/Screenshot_2021-10-20_at_13.53.59.png)

# Indirect Vasodilators

1. α1 antagonist - Prazosin and Doxazosin
2. Ganglion Blocker - Hexamethonium
3. Guanethidine - Reduces NA Release from the Postganglionic SNS Neuron 
- These Indirect Vasodilators produce vasodilation by reducing NA release and hence, α1-Mediated Vasoconstriction

---

# Centrally Acting Hypertensives

### Autonomic Regulation in the CNS

- These act to reduce the SNS Outflow of the CNS/Spinal Cord
- Main areas of the Brainstem involved in controlling Autonomic Outflow:
1. Nucleus Tractus Solitarius/Nucleus of the Solitary Tract - Main integration site for the ANS, receiving input from Baroreceptors, Chemoreceptors etc. to alter the magnitude of the output of the SNS and PSNS
- The NTS projects to the Caudal Ventrolateral Medulla and to the Nucleus Ambiguus
1. Nucleus Ambiguus - Receives axons from the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract conveying information regarding PSNS Outflow of the CNS. 
- The Nucleus Ambiguus contains PSNS Preganglionic Neurons that project down to the Heart and other Thoracic Viscera to produce Negative Chronotropy
1. Caudal Ventrolateral Medulla - Receives axons from the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract conveying information regarding SNS outflow of the CNS
- This region contains Inhibitory Neurons which project to the Rostral Ventrolateral Medulla to inhibit it and reduce SNS outflow from the CNS
1. Rostral Ventrolateral Medulla - These contains excitatory neurons that project to Preganglionic SNS Neurons in the Spinal Cord to produce SNS Outflow of the Spinal Cord
- α2-AR are expressed in the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (on Inhibitory Interneurons) and the Rostral Ventrolateral Medulla, where they inhibit these regions
- Centrally acting α2-AR Agonists can inhibit inhibitory interneurons in the NTS (which increases excitation of the CVLM) and the RVLM, reducing SNS Outflow from the brain, reducing BP by reducing HR, SV and TPR

### α-Methyl Dopa

- Tyrosine → L-Dopa (Tyrosine Hydroxylase)
- L-Dopa → Dopamine (DOPA Decarboxylase)
- Dopamine → Noradrenaline (Dopamine β Hydroxylase)
- α-Methyl DOPA can be administered into the blood and cross the Blood Brain Barrier to enter and act on the CNS and PNS (SNS Neurons)
- Here, it competes with L-Dopa as an alternative substrate to DOPA Decarboxylase and is metabolised in the same metabolic pathway as L-Dopa to form α-methyl Noradrenaline
- α-Methyl DOPA → α-Methyl Dopamine → α-Methyl Noradrenaline
- α-Methyl Noradrenaline then acts in a similar manner to NA in that it is packaged into Vesicles and Exocytosed into the Synaptic Cleft alongside NA when the Nerve is stimulated
- Whilst NA acts on α1 and α2-AR, α-MethylNA has selectivity for α2 (Less activity on α1).
- α-MethylNA can act on Postsynaptic α2 centrally to inhibit the NTS and RVLM to reduce SNS
- α-MethylNA can also act on Presynaptic α2 (Autoreceptors) centrally and peripherally to inhibit neurotransmitter/NA release to reduced Postsynaptic AR stimulation
- When α-Methyl NA is taken up into vesicles, the limited capacity of the vesicle for NA storage means that less NA is taken up, causing [NA] in the Vesicle to decrease
- This means that there is decreased α1 Stimulation (Less Vasoconstriction) and increased α2 stimulation (Reduced SNS Outflow and Activity/NA Release from SNS Neurons), both of which lower BP

![Screenshot 2021-10-20 at 14.33.44.png](%5BUMP2006%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%20f8cd605cc4474ca8a86639426fcb1587/Screenshot_2021-10-20_at_14.33.44.png)

### α2 Agonists

- α2-AR Agonists (E.g Clonidine) stimulate Presynaptic α2-AR on the Postganglionic SNS Neuron, reducing NA release which reduces α1-AR Mediated Vasoconstriction
- They also stimulate Postsynaptic α2 in the NTS and RVLM to reduce SNS Outflow, reducing the firing rate of Postganglionic SNS Neurons which reduces NA Release and α1-AR Mediated Vasoconstriction
- They therefore significantly reduce NA Release via direct inhibition of NA release at the Nerve Terminal and SNS Outflow from the CNS via α2 stimulation
- Some vessels express Postsynaptic α2-AR. Here, α2-AR Agonists cause Vasoconstriction
- However Postsynaptic α2 expression is much less than Presynaptic α2 expression so Postsynaptic α2 Vasoconstriction is far outweighed by reduction in NA released caused by Presynaptic α2, with the net effect being Vasodilation
- Due to Postsynaptic α2 expression only occurring in a few vascular beds around the body, causing Systemic Vasodilation but localised Vasoconstriction where postsynaptic α2 is expressed - overall effect is reduction in TPR

![Screenshot 2021-10-20 at 14.35.28.png](%5BUMP2006%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%20f8cd605cc4474ca8a86639426fcb1587/Screenshot_2021-10-20_at_14.35.28.png)

### α-Methyl Dopa

1. Replacement of NA with α-MethylNA in Postganglionic SNS Vesicles means there is reduced activation of α1 (due to low affinity of α-methylNA for α1), causing less α1-Mediated Vasoconstriction
2. α-MethylNA in Postganglionic SNS Vesicles stimulates Presynaptic α2, reducing NA release which reduces α1-mediated Vasoconstriction
3. α-Methyl NA activates α2 in the RVLM and NTS of the Vasomotor Centre of the Medulla, Reducing SNS Outflow and hence, reducing α1-Mediated Vasoconstriction

![Screenshot 2021-10-20 at 15.10.27.png](%5BUMP2006%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%20f8cd605cc4474ca8a86639426fcb1587/Screenshot_2021-10-20_at_15.10.27.png)

## Side Effects

### α-Methyl DOPA

1. Sedation 
- NA is the major neurotransmitter involved in the Ascending Reticular Activating System which is involved in maintaining alertness and consciousness
- α-Methyl DOPA reduces NA levels within the ARAS, promoting Sedation
1. Postural Hypotension
- Hypotensive effects of α-Methyl Dopa by limiting the ability of the CNS to increase SNS output when needed means that when changing posture, there is reduced SNS output as a response of the Baroreceptor Reflex in order to maintain BP and CO, causing Postural Hypotension
1. Dry Mouth - SNS is involved in Salivary Secretion so Reducing NA Release reduces Salivary Output, producing a Dry Mouth

---

# β-Blockers

- These reduce CO by inhibiting β1 within the Heart that produce Positive Chronotropy and Inotropy upon stimulation
- Activation of β2-AR on Vasculature leads to Vasodilation so β-Blockers may produce slight Vasoconstriction (This is avoided by using β1 Selective Blockers that are selective for β1 in the Heart but not β2 in the Lungs and Vasculature)
- Stimulation of β1-AR In the Kidneys leads to Renin Release so β Blockers prevent activation of the RAAS
- Stimulation of Presynaptic β2-AR stimulates Neurotransmitter release from Postganglionic SNS Neurons
- Activation of β-AR within the CNS reduces SNS Outflow/Tone and resets the Baroreceptor Reflex
- As β-Blockers cause CO to fall (Due to reduced HR and SV), the Baroreceptor Reflex will be activated to try and restore BP by increasing SNS Tone and Reducing PSNS Tone
- β-Blockers act on the CNS to reset the Baroreceptor Reflex, making it less sensitive so that a larger deviation from the baseline BP is needed in order to stimulate the Baroreceptor Reflex
- This prevents the Baroreceptor Reflex from producing Reflex Vasoconstriction (As β-Blockers act on the Heart not the Vasculature) in an attempt to increase BP back to normal

---

# β-Blockers and the Baroreceptor Reflex

- Baroreceptors are located in the Aortic Arch and Carotid Sinus, responding to increased Distension of the Vasculature with increased Firing Rate of Baroreceptor Afferents
- When BP increases, there is greater Vascular Distension
- During Systole, there is a rise in BP which increases the firing rate of Baroreceptors and During Diastole, there is a fall in BP which decreases the firing rate of Baroreceptors
- In Hypertensive Individuals, the average firing rate of the Baroreceptors is much higher than that in Hypotensive individuals
- These afferents are sent to the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract, increasing PSNS Outflow via the Nucleus Ambiguus and Reducing SNS Outflow via the RVLM when Firing Rate Increases and the opposite for when Firing Rate decreases
- When a Hypertensive individual is given Antihypertensives, the Baroreceptors detect this as a fall from Normal BP, leading to decreased PSNS and Increased SNS Outflow to the Heart and Vasculature
- If a drug is administered that affects BP by only affecting either the Heart or the Vasculature, there will be compensatory changes to the other structure due to the Baroreceptor Reflex in an attempt to restore BP (Reflex Tachycardia for Drugs that affect Vasculature and Reflex Vasoconstriction for Drugs that affect the Heart)

# Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System

1. Reduced Renal Perfusion causes increases Renin Secretion
2. Renin cleaves Angiotensinogen into Angiotensin I 
3. AT1 (Inactive) is then converted into AT2 (Active) by ACE, express on the Endothelium of Renal and Respiratory Vasculature
4. AT2 then acts in multiple ways to try and increase BP to restore Renal Perfusion
- AT2 causes:
1. Increased SNS Drive to the Heart and Vasculature to increase BP
2. Increased Reabsorption of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ and excretion of K⁺ in the Kidneys to increase Osmotic Water Reabsorption in the Kidneys to increase ECV and BP
3. Secretion of Aldosterone by Adrenal Cortex to stimulate ADH release from the Posterior Pituitary Gland to increase Water Reabsorption by the Kidneys to increase ECV and BP
4. AT2 acts directly on vasculature to produce vasoconstriction
- Therefore, reducing the activity of AT2 on the Body causes a significant reduction in BP (Reduced SNS Tone, Reduced Water Reabsorption and Vasodilation)
- In Hypertensive Px, the RAAS is hyperactive despite no reduction to renal perfusion. Therefore, reducing BP in Hypertensive Individuals will not increase Renin Secretion

### Drugs

- ACE Inhibitors - Most common drugs that target RAAS. This keeps [AT2] (Active) low to decrease BP via reduced AT2 activity
- E.g Rami**pril**, Captopril and Enalapril
- Aliskiren - Renin Inhibitor to prevent the conversion of Angiotensinogen into AT1, reducing AT2 formation and hence lowering BP
- AT1R Antagonsit - Losartan - Reduce the activity of AT2 on the CNS, Vasculature and Kidneys, lowering BP
- Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists can be used to compete with Aldosterone to reduce the release of ADH and Water Reabsorption, preventing an increase in BP
- Amiloride/Triamterene - Block ENaC to reduced Na⁺ reabsorption, reducing Osmotic Water Reabsorption and subsequently BP
