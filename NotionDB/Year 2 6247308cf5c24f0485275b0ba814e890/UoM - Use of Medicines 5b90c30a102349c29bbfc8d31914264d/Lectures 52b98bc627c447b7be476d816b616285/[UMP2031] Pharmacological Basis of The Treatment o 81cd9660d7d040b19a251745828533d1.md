# [UMP2031] Pharmacological Basis of The Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus and Hyper- and Hypothyroidism

# Diabetes Mellitus

- Hyperglycaemia: fasting glucose > 7 mM, random blood glucose > 11 mM.
- Symptoms: polydipsia, polyurea, glucosuria, muscle wasting, weight loss, extreme fatigue.
- T1DM: rapid onset in childhood, serum insulin levels are low, autoimmune disease, daily injection of insulin is essential, prone to ketoacidosis due to hypoinsulinaemia.
- T2DM: slow onset > 50 years of age, insulin resistance, serum insulin may be high or low but beta cells do not release enough β to sufficiently oppose Hyperglycaemia
- It is treated initially with dietary adjustment then drugs and finally Insulin when β Cell Failure develops and T2DM is often undiscovered

---

# Discovery of Insulin

- Bant and Banting used Dogs as animal models to study the pathophysiology of Diabetes Mellitus, inducing Diabetic Dogs by removing their pancreas and ligating the Pancreas
- This ligation of the Pancreas caused enzymatic degeneration of the Exocrine Pancreas, whilst keeping the Endocrine Aspect of the Pancreas unaffected
- This Partially degenerated Pancreas was extracted and injected into the Diabetic Dogs, where the Extract led to a reduction in Blood Sugar
- This indicates the role of the Pancreas in the Pathophysiology of DM
- Later on, Collip and MacLeod chemically purified the Pancreatic Extract to isolate Insulin, which was tested on Px in 1922, leading to reductions in Blood Glucose of these Px

---

# Diabetic Ketoacidosis

- Insulin deficiency leads to ketoacidosis (as a result of accumulation of FFAs), hyperglycaemia and osmotic diuresis and volume loss.
- Diagnosed when there is ↑ blood glucose, metabolic acidosis and ketonuria.
- Complications include hypovolaemic shock, hypokalaemia, gastroparesis and coma.

---

# Insulin Therapy

- Insulin therapy aims to mimic physiological background and postprandial peaks of insulin without triggering hypoglycaemia.
- Once daily routine: taken first thing in morning before breakfast to maintain a constant level of Insulin over the day - This insulin is intermediate/long lasting.
- However, this cannot be used to compensate for Postprandial Hyperglycaemia as Insulin levels cannot increase to counteract this
- Twice daily routine: short acting and intermediate acting insulin is taken before breakfast and again before dinner to prevent postprandial hyperglycaemia and maintain background/basal levels of Insulin in the blood.
- Four times daily routine: short-acting insulin is taken 3 times a day (before every meal) and intermediate acting insulin is taken before going to bed to maintain insulin levels overnight.
- Dosage: usually starts at 0.5 units/kg/day but there is no fixed rule on this (it is tailed to the individual).
- Regimes that involve more frequent insulin administration are more effective in managing Blood Glucose Levels as Insulin can be administered before meals to prevent Post-prandial Hyperglycaemia, allowing Insulin levels to fluctuate to maintain Normoglycaemia
- However, as Insulin is a peptide, it must be injected and hence, more frequent administration regimes often have poorer conformity due to the need for multiple injections
- Insulin preparations vary in regards to their origin (Human, Porcine and Beef Insulin)
- Insulin Analogues vary in onset, duration of action and peak in plasma concentration based on the presence/absence of retardants

- Monitoring Glycaemic Control in T1DM is established by self monitoring of blood glucose, at least 2x a day pre-insulin to minimise the risk of Hypoglycaemia
- HbA1c is important for determining Px conformity to Insulin Therapy and how effective their glycaemic control is over the past 3 months
- Blood [Glucose] target:
1. Pre-meal: 4-7 mmol/L.
2. Post-meal: < 10 mmol/L.

### Adverse Effects

1. Hypoglycaemia (often due to Hyperglycaemia) → Prevents by ensuring Px adheres to management plan regarding life style factors and diet
2. Lipoatrophy → This is a problem with Porcine Insulin
3. Lipohypertrophy → This is minimised by varying the injection site
4. Weight Gain → Trophic effect of Insulin (This is difficult to manage)

# Hypoglycaemia in Diabetics

- Potential complications of therapy with insulin/sulphonylureas.
- G < 3.5 leads to adrenergic symptoms.
- G < 2.5 leads to neuroglycopenic symptoms.

### Management

- Mild episodes: sugary drink.
- More severe: glucogel to buccal mucosa or  IV 25-50 ml 50% glucose or IM glucagon (1 mg) which mobilises hepatic glycogen stores in increasing severity of Hypoglycaemia.

---

# Impact of Diabetes Mellitus and Risk Factors

- T2DM is more common than T1DM and whilst the Incidence of T1DM has remained constant over time, the Incidence of T2DM is increasing exponentially
- Heart and vascular disease including atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease.
- Renal artery disease and nephropathy.
- Peripheral and Autonomic Neuropathy, retinopathy, Cerebral Vasculopathy and potential amputations
- Amputation (Diabetic Foot).
- Erectile dysfunction

### Risk Factors for T2DM

- **Old Age**
- Genetic Predisposition (Risk increased from 10 to 35%)
- Nutrition (High Fat/Sugar Diet)
- **Obesity** → Most Important Risk Factor
- Physical inactivity
- Prenatal Factors
- Foetal Malnutrition

---

# Aim of Diabetes Mellitus Management

- Treat hyperglycaemia
- Prevent long-term complications.
- Limit adverse effects of treatment.

### Treatment of Diabetes

- Patient Education to ensure compliance with treatment regimes
- Nutritional Control
- Pharmacological Treatment (Tailored to the individual)
- Monitoring of Glycaemic Control
- Screening for Complications

### Therapeutic Strategies to Reduce Hyperglycaemia in T2DM

1. Stimulate Pancreatic Insulin Secretion
2. Promote Insulin-Mediated Glucose Disposal by Muscle and Adipose Tissue
3. Reduce Glucose Production by the Liver
4. Limit Glucose Absorption across the GI Tract

---

# Sulphonylureas

- Example: tolbutamide + gliclazide (1st Gen), glibenclamide (2nd Gen), glimepride.
- First Gen just have a Sulphonylurea Group but 2nd and 3rd Gen had Sulphonylurea and Benzamido Groups attached
- Meglitinide is not a Sulphonylurea but contains a Benzamido group like 2nd Generation Sulphonylureas and can stimulate insulin secretion, with a higher receptor affinity than Gliclazide
- First oral antidiabetic drug, developed from Sulphonamide antibiotics that caused Hypoglycaemia.
- Insulin secretagogue
- Sulphonylureas close K⁺-ATP channels on 𝛽 cells to depolarise the 𝛽 cell and ↑ insulin secretion.
- These are useful in non-obese patients but can cause hypoglycaemia and weight gain.
- Glicazide shows greater 𝛽-Cell Specifcity than Glibenclamide and hence, produces fewer side effects (notably Cardiac as Glibenclamide has a similar affinity for 𝛽 Cell and Cardiac K⁺-ATP channels)
- Hormonal Input (E.g Incretins) stimulate Insulin Secretion via Gs-AC-cAMP pathway → Neurohormonal Ampifying Pathway
- Neural Input (Eg ACh from PSNS) activates Gq-PKB Pathway to cleave PIP2 into DAG and IP3, with DAG directly and IP3 indirectly (via increased Ca²⁺ Influx) stimulating Insulin Secretion → Metabolic Amplifying Pathway

# Biguanides

- Example: metformin → Most common prescribed Rx
- Biguanides promote glucose uptake and ↓ hepatic glucose production but have no effect on insulin secretion from 𝛽 cells.
- Enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by phosphorylating GLUT-4 enhancer factor).
- ↓ glucose absorption in GI tract.
- Available in different forms: tablets for immediate release (up to 3 times/day) or prolonged released (/day) and oral solution and powder for oral solution for immediate release.
- These are useful as First Line Rx in obese patients during initial stages of T2DM (Where Insulin Resistance is main feature) but not in those with renal failure or heart failure as it can exacerbate this

---

# Thiazolidinediones (Glitazones)

- Example: pio**glitazone** and rosiglitazone,
- Act primarily on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue to sensitise them to insulin and hence, ↑ insulin-mediate glucose uptake.
- They have been shown to increase the risk of Bladder Cancer and Cardiovascular Events so are not frequently prescribed
- Agonists for PPAR𝛾 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor).
- Upregulates target genes such as IRS1, IRS2, PI3K, GLUT4 to increase insulin sensitivity

---

# 𝜶-Glucosidase Inhibitors

- Example: acarbose
- Acarbose slows down breakdown of complex carbohydrates to ↓ post-prandial hyperglycaemia.
- Acarbose is poorly tolerated and causes GI disturbance.

---

# GLP-1 Mimetics

- Example: exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon), liraglutide.
- These stimulate the Incretin Effect to stimulate Insulin Secretion and inhibit Glucagon Secretion to lower Blood Glucose Levels
- Byetta 2/daily injection.
- Bydureon 1/weekly injection.
- Liraglutide 1/daily injection.
- Improve glycaemic control, with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, but are expensive and can commonly cause nausea.
- Cause sustained weight loss

---

# DPP-4 Inhibitors

- Example: gliptins (sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin)
- These inhibit the Metabolism and hence, inactivation of GLP-1 and GIP by DPP-4, increasing their [ ] to increase Insulin Secretion and reduce Glucagon Secretion to lower Blood Glucose
- Their advantages over GLP-1 Mimetics include the fact that they are not peptide and hence, can be taken orally vs Injected and they cause fewer side effects such as nausea and are difficult to overdose on (as they just prolong the effects of Endogenous Hormones)
- However, unlike GLP-1 Mimetics, They do not produce direct CNS effects and no effect on satiety or weight loss, they are not specific for GLP-1 and they affect other DPP enzymes in the body.

# K⁺-ATP Channels

- Found on pancreatic 𝛽-cells, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, heart muscle and neurons.
- Important in:
1. Glucose-dependent insulin release.
2. Vascular smooth muscle tone.
3. Glucose sensors in brain.
4. Muscle fatigue
5. Protective during ischaemia.
6. Ischaemic preconditioning

---

# Management of Type II Diabetes

- Following Dx of T2DM, Px should be put on Low Sugar Diets which are low calorie and encouraged to lose weight
- If the Px has Poor Glycaemic Control as a result and the Px is obese, the defect is likely in target cells so 1st Line = Metformin and 2nd Line = Metformin + Sulphonylurea
- If Px has Poor Glycaemic Control as a result and is not obese, the defect is likely in the Pancreatic β Cells so 1st Line = Sulphonylurea and 2nd Line = Metformin + Sulphonylurea
- 3rd,4th and 5th Line for both obese and non-obese Px = Insulin, Glitazones and Exenatide/Gliptins for when β Cell Dysfunction develops

# Effect of Thyroid Hormones

- They are involved in Increasing Metabolism, Growth and Development (mainly in the Brain) and Increased Effect of Catecholamines
- Specific Effects of Thyroid Hormone are:
1. Increased CO
2. Increased HR
3. Increased RR
4. Increased BMR
5. Increased SNS Activity
6. Potentiation of Brain Development
7. Increased Protein and Carbohydrate Metabolism
- ↑ HR
- ↑ ventilation rate
- ↑ basal metabolic rate.
- ↑ sympathetic activity.
- Potentiates brain development.
- ↑ metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates

---

# Hyperthyroidism

- TSH is low.
- Thyroxine (T4) is high.
- This can be caused by Grave’s Disease, Thyroid Adenoma or Thyroiditis

---

# Drugs for Hyperthyroidism

### Carbimazole

- Thyroid peroxidase inhibitor, which prevents generation of T3/T4.
- Causes rash, GI upset and agranulocytosis.
- It is delayed in its onset and 50% of Px who receive Carbimazole relapse to Hyperthyroidism

### Propylthiouracil

- Thyroid peroxidase inhibitor, which prevents generation of T3/T4.
- Reserved for those that are intolerant to carbimazole.
- Higher rate of agranulocytosis than Carbimazole and also causes inhibition of peripheral deiodination.

### Radioactive Iodine

- Complete destruction of thyroid gland by 𝛽 radiation.
- Decays with t1/2 of 8 days.
- There must be subsequent T4 replacement therapy afterwards due to replace the action of the Thyrotrophs that are now destroyed.

---

# Hypothyroidism

- Low levels of circulating T3 and T4.
- High levels of TSH.
- Rx involves Identifying a Cause (Atropic, Primary Myxoedema, Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, Lithium or Amiodarone) and then replacing the Hormone using Levothyroxine (Synthetic T4)

---

# Drugs for Hypothyroidism

### Levothyroxine

- Synthetic T4
- Delayed onset of action.
- During Levothyroxine Therapy, it is important to monitor Px’s clinical status/Sx and TSH levels, aiming to achieve normal TSH levels.
