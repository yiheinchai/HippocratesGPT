# [UMP2003] Pharmacology of the Neuromuscular Junction

# Cholinergic Synaptic Transmission

- Neuromuscular Transmission is an example of fast cholinergic synaptic transmission (msec)
- Fast Cholinergic Transmission involving nAChRs also occurs within Autonomic Ganglia
- Fast Cholinergic Synapses (nAChRs) were distinguished from Slow Cholinergic Synapses (mAChRs) by the fact that Fast Cholinergic Synapses can be selective activated by Nicotine and blocked by Curare
- As nerve-muscular synapses are easily accessible, they have been used to model chemical synaptic transmission for peripheral and central synapses
- Cholinesterase breaks down ACh at all Cholinergic Synapses (central and peripheral)

# Nerve Muscle Transmission

- Synapse = Presynaptic Nerve Terminal and Postsynaptic Muscle Fibre
- NMJ Nerve Terminal is covered by Schwann Cell and is identified under EM by its large nucleus
- Postsynaptic Sarcolemma is highly folded to increase its SA
- ACh is concentrated in vesicles in the Nerve Terminal, which can be depleted by sustained nerve activity and by toxins which cause transmitter release
- The Basement Membrane is found on the Postsynaptic Sarcolemma between the Pre and Postsynaptic Cells and is where Cholinesterase is found
- Bernard Katz suggested that vesicles fuse with the presynaptic cell membrane to release their content into the Synaptic Cleft (Vesicle Hypothesis)
- Density of nAChRs is greatest at the Crests of the Postsynaptic Folds, opposite Active Zones (where Vesicles congregate)
- Vesicles contain 5000-10000 ACh molecules
- Only around 50% of these molecules successful activate nAChRs as many are broken down by AChE present in the basement membrane before they are able to stimulate nAChRs found deep to the basement membrane on the Postsynaptic Sarcolemma
- Arrangement of AChE-Containing Basement Membrane and nAChRs on Postsynaptic Sarcolemma deep to it allows the rapid removal of ACh within <1 msec to allow for fast transmission

# Enhancing or Blocking Transmission

- Normal Synaptic Transmission at the Endplate = Nerve Impulse → Depolarisation of Nerve Terminal → Ca²⁺ Entry → ACh Release → nAChR Activation → Increased Postsynaptic Permeability to Na⁺/K⁺ → Generation of EPP at the Endplate Region of the Sarcolemma → Generation of AP and Muscle Twitch
- If the Localised Depolarisation caused by ACh (EPP) is large enough, it triggers an AP followed by a muscle twitch

### Common sites of Drug Action Regarding Synaptic Transmission

1. Uptake of Precursor
2. Transmitter synthesis from precursor
3. Transmitter Packaging into vesicles
4. Exocytosis of Vesicle Content
5. Competitive Antagonist binding to the Postsynaptic Receptor
6. Non-Competitive Antagonist (acting at a site beyond the receptor)
7. Block of Transmitter breakdown (applies mainly to Cholinergic and Purinergic Synapses)

### Normal Sequence of Events at the NMJ

1. ACh in Vesicles is released into the cleft (some of which acts on ACh Receptors)
2. ACh in the cleft is inactivated by Cholinesterase by converting it to Choline
3. Choline is uptaken back into the Nerve Terminal by a Choline Carrier Mechanism
4. Choline is converted into ACh inside the nerve terminal by Choline Acetyl Transferase

# Drugs Acting on the NMJ

## Presynaptically Acting Substances

### Hemicholinium

- Resembles Choline in structure and so, competes with it for the Uptake Carrier in Cholinergic Nerve Terminals
- Choline uptake is inhibited and the synthesis of ACh fails to keep up with the release, reducing ACh release
- It is not used therapeutically but is useful experimentally

### Botulinum Toxin (BTx)

- Tetanus toxin works in a similar manner but is much less potent
- Both Tetanus and BTx are high molecular weight proteins produced by Anaerobic Clostridium bacteria that can grow in badly tinned food (E.g fish) and badly preserved meats, sausages, yogurts etc.
- BTx blocks the Ca²⁺-step in the Vesicle Release process and the docking and fusion of vesicles with the presynaptic membrane
- It provides almost complete blocking of the release of the transmitter but has no effect on Transmitter synthesis or on the postsynaptic membrane
- It is the most toxic substance known as <10 molecules per endplate are needed to completely block transmitter release
- Hence, very few molecules (Few 100,000s - too small to measure by conventional means) will produce a complete irreversible paralysis of muscles like the Diaphragm, which would impair breathing
- The effects of BTx can only be corrected by the synthesis of new endplates as there is no good antidote
- Prognosis is poor in the elderly and the very young

### Aminoglycoside Antibiotics

- E.g Streptomycin
- Inhibit transmitter release, likely by blocking Ca²⁺ entry into the nerve terminal (Less severely than BTx)
- These cause Muscle Weakness as a side effect of their use and hence, they can potentiate the action of Neuromuscular Blockers
- This can be an important consideration after surgery, where neuromuscular blockers are often used

## Postsynaptically Acting Substancs

- Used in surgery to cause muscle relaxation to reduce the amount of general anaesthetic is needed, especially during longer procedures

### Competitive Blockers

- Tubocurarine, Atracurium, Gallamine and Pancuronium
- Compete with ACh for receptor sites
- Neuromuscular Blockade produced induces a gradual block of the Muscle Twitch response

![lWNg1KJOFx5dTPZC.png](%5BUMP2003%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20the%20Neuromuscular%20Juncti%204d701220e628473dadf4988a34a62f31/lWNg1KJOFx5dTPZC.png)

### Depolarising Blockers

- Suxamethonium
- Activates ACh receptors but its effect is sustained instead of transient
- Sustained depolarisation of excitable cells tends to inactivate Na⁺ Channels involved in AP generation.
- This means that the muscle fibres can no longer produce APs, preventing Muscle Twitch generation

### Suxamethonium Sensitivity

- Suxamethonium is the most widely used depolarising blocker
- In normal individuals, its action usually only lasts around 5 minutes as it is rapidly hydrolysed by Plasma Cholinesterase (Pseudocholinesterase)
- Pseudocholinesterase is not associated with synapses but is present in blood plasma in most people
- If Plasma Pseudocholinesterase activity is low, Suxamethonium action is prolonged, sometimes for hours.
- 1:3000 ppl have a genetic condition where [Plasma ChE] is low or absent.
- 1:50 ppl are heterozygous for this gene and hence, are poor at breaking down Suxamethonium
- Liver DIsease, Malnutrition, Pregnancy and use of a Cholinesterase blocking drug can cause low [Plasma ChE]
- Competitive and Depolarising Blockers are widely used clinically, but in different circumstances

# Ganglion Agonists and Blockers

- Ganglia nAChR differ in pharmacology and Subunit AA Sequence to Muscle nAChR
- This means that drugs that act on Ganglia nAChRs don't necessarily act on Muscle nAChRs and vice versa
- All outputs from the Ventral Spinal Cord (motor and preganglionic neurons) release ACh onto nAChRs
    
    ![Z7XBRwNyjbclrYLw.png](%5BUMP2003%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20the%20Neuromuscular%20Juncti%204d701220e628473dadf4988a34a62f31/Z7XBRwNyjbclrYLw.png)
    

## Ganglion Agonists

### Nicotine

- Volatile tertiary amine
- Uncharged
- Absorbed via the lungs
- Affects the CNS

### Tetramethyl Ammonium

- Charged quarternary amine
- Not readily absorbed

### ACh

### Carbachol

## Ganglion Blockers

- Selective for autonomic ganglia nAChR but do not distinguish between SNS and PSNS Ganglia, so their side effects are therapeutically undesirable

### Hexamethonium

- Charged quarternary amine
- Poorly absorbed
- First effective treatment for High BP

### Trimethaphan

- Ganglion Blockers like Trimethaphan are used by Anasthetists to reduce Cerebral Blood Flow

# Anti-Cholinesterase Drugs

- Two types of AChE exist in the body - Cholinesterase (Present at Cholinergic Synapses) and Pseudocholinesterase (Soluble, present in Blood Plasma)
- Cholinesterase Blockers are non-specific, inhibiting both types of AChE

## Hydrolysis of ACh

- ChE has 2 Active Sites:
1. Esteratic Site - Has serine residue in a prominent position, where the reactive serine hydroxyl group can break the ester bond in the ACh Molecule.
- It is named this as it combines with the Ester group in the ACh molecule
1. Anionic (-ve) Site - Where initial binding occurs. An Ionized carboxyl group forms an ionic bond with the positively charged cationic head of ACh
- ACh Hydrolysis occurs in discrete steps:
1. Acetyl group (CH₃-C=O) is transferred to the Serine OH Group
2. Choline part of the molecule dissociates from the active site to leave an 'Acetylated Enzyme'
3. Bond holding the Acetyl Group to the OH of the Serine is rapidly hydrolysed to produce Acetic Acid and the regenerated enzyme
- The active site has a high rate of catalytic activity, allowing for a high rate of ACh hydrolysis so that all the ACh that is released into the Cleft per nerve impulse can be hydrolysed in < 1 msec

![WmMuBbyW9EaQfiWa.jpeg](%5BUMP2003%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20the%20Neuromuscular%20Juncti%204d701220e628473dadf4988a34a62f31/WmMuBbyW9EaQfiWa.jpeg)

- 3 Main Types of Cholinesterase Blockers:

### Short Acting Reversible Blockers

- E.g Edrophonium
- Structurally similar to ACh
- Its quaternary ammonium group combines with the enzyme only at its anionic site as it lacks an esteratic group
- It displays simple competition with ACh at the anionic site
- It combines rapidly but weakly with ChEs, meaning onset of action is abrupt, but duration of action is very short
- It is used as a diagnostic tool for certain muscle diseases

### Medium/Long Acting Reversible Blocker

- E.g Neostigmine, Pyridostigmine and Eserine
- Contains a Quaternary Ammonium group that binds at the anionic site and an ester bond forms with the Serine OH group at the Esteratic Site
- Stages of enzyme interaction are identical to those for ACh, except the rate of reaction is much slower
- Carbamyl Esters (E.g Neostigmine) act as alternative substrates however, their rate of Hydrolysis of 200,000x is slower than that for ACh - During which time the enzyme is unable to Hydrolyse ACh
- They are Therapeutically important, used to treat Myasthenia Gravis and to reverse Competitive Blockers

### Long-Acting Irreversible Blockers

- E.g Parathion, Paraoxon, Dyflos/DFP
- Almost exclusively pentavalent organophosphate compounds
- Lack a quaternary N⁺ and hence, only react with the Esteratic Site of the Enzyme, not the Anionic Site
- Low [ ] bind reversible with the Esteratic Site but High [ ] bind irreversibly
- The fluoride of DFP is removed by Hydrolysis, permanently phosphorylating the Esteratic site, inactivating it
- Dissociation of the Phosphoryl group from ChE by hydrolysis is extremely slow (E.g Months).
- There are a number of Central and Peripheral Cholinesterase Reactivators that can be used as antidotes to treat poisoning with Cholinesterase blockers
- They were prepared as Nerve Gases
- Recent examples include Novichok and also Potent Insecticides using less potent Long Acting Irreversible Blockers

# Uses of Cholinesterase Blockers

### Treatment of Glaucoma

- Reduces IOP by enhancing PSNS Synaptic Transmission
- Physostigmine or an irreversible blocker can be applied topically

### GI Tract

- Neostigmine is used to enhance muscle tone post-operatively

### Myasthenia Gravis

- Neostigmine and Pyridostigmine are used to enhance synaptic transmission at the end plate

### Reversal of Neuromuscular Block After Anaesthesia

- Effects of muscle relaxants (E.g Tubocurarine) are rapidly reversed by enhancing ACh transmission with a Cholinesterase blocker

### Organophosphate Insecticides

- Parathion, Carbamates etc. are widely used in sheep and cattle dips
- They are hazardous to farm workers and animals but also gardeners and non-injurious insects
- As insects have a short life cycle/rapid reproduction rate, many have been able to develop resistant forms of Cholinesterase
