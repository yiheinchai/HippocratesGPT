# Theory of Chemotherapy and Underlying Problems

### Theory of Chemotherapy

- In chemotherapy, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, helminths, viruses and
cancer cells are considered parasites.
- Ehrlich showed that some dyes preferentially bind to Human Tissue and others for microbes, indicating qualitative differences in the molecules found between Human Tissue and Microbes
- Therefore, if there was a biochemical pathway that was uniquely expressed in a Microbe and essential to its survival but not seen/important in Human Tissue which gave rise to these qualitative differences, this pathway could be selectively targeted to destroy the microbe without affecting the host tissue
- The standard Model of Chemotherapy invovles trying to find a qualitative difference between the Parasite/Microbe and the Human Host Cell due to the expression of a unique biochemical pathway within the Microbe that is not found in the Human Cell
- If this cannot be achieved, quantitative biochemical differences can be identified where there is a common biochemical pathway in Parasites and Human Cells but this pathway is more significant/important for survival in the Microbe than it is in the Human Cell
- When this difference is established, a drug is used that selectively targets this unique pathway in the Microbe or that has higher affinity for the Microbe Biochemical Pathway than its corresponding pathway within the Human Cell to provide selective microbe toxicity with minimal effects on the Human Cell as the drug has very low affinity for the Human Biochemical Pathway but a high affinity for the Microbe Biochemical Pathway
- If the same target and biochemical pathway is found in the Host Cell and Microbe, whilst drugs may theoretically act equally on the Host and Microbe Cell to cause Cytotoxicity in both cells, the Host Cell may have a unique safety pathway that prevents cell damage/destruction following inactivation of the specific biochemical pathway in the Host Cell (E.g may produce same product of Biochemical Pathway)

- Genomic Analysis of Cancerous and Healthy Cells can be used to identify biochemical differences between two cells, allowing for the identification of potential drug targets in the Cancer Cell not found in the Human Cell which can be used to Rx the Cancer with Minimal Toxicity

### Underlying Problems

- Bacteria have a cell wall whereas human cells do not, so many antibacterial agents target this difference (E.g Inhibition of Enzymes involved in Cell Wall Synthesis) to selectively destroy bacteria without affecting Human Cells.
- When considering Chemotherapy against Viruses, it is not possible to target Biochemical Machinery used by the Virus to replicate as the Virus utilises Host Machinery, so disruption of Viral Biochemical Pathways would damage the Host Machinery and cause Toxicity
- Instead, Chemotherapy Agents Vs Viruses are targeted Biochemicals that are uniquely encoded for within the Viral Genome (E.g Enzymes like Reverse Transcriptase) to provide Selective Viral Toxicity
- As Cancer Cells are derived from Host Cells that have undergone Malignant Transformation, there are very few Qualitative biochemical differences between the cells which can be exploited by Chemotherapy to produce selective toxicity.
- However, they do show quantitative differences (E.g Proliferation Rate) due to Alterations in Cellular Physiology that occurs when Malignant Transformation Occurs, which can be exploited to produce Chemotherapy Agents against Cancer

### Asparaginase

- Asparagine is a non-essential AA that can be sourced exogenously from the diet but also endogenous via cellular biochemical pathways
- Aspartic Acid can be converted into Asparagine via Asparagine Synthetase
- Acute Lymphoblastic Leuakaemia cells have a reduced ability to convert Aspartic Acid into Asparagine so in these cells, Asparagine becomes an Essential AA that can only be sourced exogenously (not endogenously) - This means that the cell rapidly uptakes and accumulates Asparagine from the Plasma
- In Px with ALL, Asparaginase can be given to break down Serum Asparagine into Aspartic Acid to reduce Asparagine uptake by ALL Cells and hence, proliferation, without disrupting Asparagine availability to Normal Cells as they are still able to synthesise Asparagine Endogenously
- However, as Asparaginase is a large protein, its injection into a Px can trigger Hypersensitivity Reactions

### Possible Drug Targets in Cancer Rx - Quantitative Differences

| Targetting Differences Between Normal and Tumour Cells at the Phenotypic Level | Targeting Host Biochemical Pathways |
| --- | --- |
| Proliferation Rate and Extent of Control (Neoblastic ): most of our drugs target this		 | Angiogenesis → Cancer Cells tend to stimulate Angiogenesis  |
| Differentation (Anaplastic) - Retinoids | Immune System → Cancer Cells seem to be able to suppress the Immune System to reduce Immunosurveillance |
| Metastasis and Invasiveness: adhesion molecules and metalloproteases inhibitors. | Inflammation |
- As a cell differentiates and alters its phenotype, its ability to proliferate decreases. Therefore, where Cancer cells are less differentiated than normnal cells, they maintain a high proliferative ability which causes them to often have a higher proliferation rate than normal cells
- Normally, TFs and Growth Factors prevent a cell from growing into and invading Adjacent Tissue. However, Malignant Cells become resistant to these signals, allowing them to grow into and invade other tissues via the expression of Matrix Metalloproteinases that digest the surrounding ECM to allow Malignant Cells to migrate and invade nearby tissue
- Chemotherapy is usually used in conjunction with therapeutic modalities (i.e. with surgery or radiation) to ensure complete removal of cancerous cells to prevent remission.

# Pharmacological Problems of Chemotherapy and Cancer Rx

- Therapeutic Index is a measure of drug safety based on populations
- ED50 (Median effective dose) = Dose that produces the therapeutic effect in in 50% of the population.
- TD50 (Median toxic dose) = Dose that produces the toxic effect in 50% of the population → Used in Human Studies
- LD50 (Median lethal dose) = Dose that produces the Lethal effect in 50% of the population → Used in Animal Studies.
- TI in Humans = TD50/ED50 but TI in Animals = LD50/ED50
- As TI increases, the therapeutic window of safety increases, meaning there is a greater [ ] where a drug is effective and does not produce side effects
- Penicillin has a very high therapeutic index.
- Chemotherapeutic agents are incredibly low (close to 1) as they show little selectivity for cancerous cells over human cells - This means that there is a very small range of [ ] where the drug produces therapeutic effects without toxic effects, meaning toxicity is commonly seen

### Adverse On Target Effects

- Cancer Chemotherapy therapies rely on quantitative (usually proliferation/growth rates) rather than qualitative differences.
- Therefore, as Human Host Cells are also proliferating (at a lower rate however than cancer cells), they are targeted by the Chemotherapy agents, causing Toxicity because proliferation of these cells is also inhibited, causing cell toxicity
- Poor Selectivity of Chemotherapy Agents is commonly seen between Cancerous Cells and Healthy Cells with a high proliferation rate, giving rise to toxic effects such as:
1. Bone marrow (G-CSF shortens the period of Leukopenia).
2. Healing
3. Alopecia
4. Damage to gastrointestinal epithelium, which affects nutritional status by impacting absorption.
5. Depression of growth in children.
6. Sterility
7. Teratogenicity
8. Severe nausea, commonly due to damage to GI Epithelium (Rx with 5-HT3 receptor antagonist).

### Secondary Malignancies

- Many Cancer Chemotherapeutic Agents work by directly interacting/binding with DNA and hence, can interact with Healthy and Cancerous Cells
- When they interact with DNA In Healthy Cells, they can cause DNA Damage here which causes Mutations to arise - Instead of leading to Apoptosis (Mechanism by which these drugs kill Cancer Cells), these Mutations can drive Malignant Transformation of previously healthy cells, causing progression of Cancer due to Chemotherapy Agents

![Screenshot 2022-03-27 at 17.11.52.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-27_at_17.11.52.png)

### Heterogeneity of Cancer Cells

- Within a Single Tumour, different cells can have different mutational profiles and hence, different genomes, producing Genetic Heterogeneity
- This Genetic Heterogeneity can be seen within a single tumour (Intraheterogeneity) or in the same tumour type across different patients/locations within the body (Interheterogeneity)
- This lack of Genetic Uniformity within a Single Tumour Type within a Px means that Chemotherapy Agents will show different levels of effectiveness across different Tumours of the same type (different cells within a single tumour show different sensitivities/resistances to the chemotherapy agent) depending on the specific mutational profile of the cells in the Tumour, what proportion of the cells express the drug target and at what levels this target is expressed in each cell.
- Due to Genetic Heterogeneity, some cells within a tumour may be sensitive to the chemotherapy agent (if they express the drug target) whilst others may be resistant (if they do not express the drug target). This means that following destruction of susceptible cells due to the Chemotherapeutic Agent, there is increased space and reduced competition for the Resistant Cells, allowing them to proliferate more rapidly to produce resistant tumours where the previous Rx is no longer effective

### Drug Resistance

- Due to Genetic Heterogeneity and Phenotypic Instability of Tumours due to their predisposition to acquiring new mutations, this can lead to the development of drug resistance clones.
- Drug Resistance can arise due to:
1. Changes to PK
2. Drug Inactivation
3. Generation of Escape Mechanisms that produce the end product of the Biochemical pathway targeted by the Chemotherapy Agent so that the Agent no longer prevents the production of the Product
4. Adaptation of Cellular Responses to the Drug
- This Resistance can be drug-specific or class-specific
- Example of Multidrug Resistance Protein - P170 is encoded by mdr1 gene and P170 acts as an efflux pump to efflux noxious agents (including Chemotherapeutic Agents) out of the cell, preventing Chemotherapy Agents from acting intracellularly to destroy cancerous cells

![Screenshot 2022-03-27 at 17.27.54.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-27_at_17.27.54.png)

### Cell Cycle

- The susceptibility of Cancer Cells To a Given Drug is Often Dependent on the Cell Cycle
- Most Chemotherapeutic drugs only specifically target a cell in a particular phase of cell cycle.
- Antimetabolites and Alkylating Agents only target S phase and Plant Alkaloids mainly target M Phase.
- Bleomycin is one of the only drugs that acts to cause cellular arrest in the G2 and G0 Phases of the Cell Cycle
- In Response to many Chemotherapeutic Agents due to their effect on the Cell Cycle, this causes many Cancer Cells to stop proliferating as there is increased drug activity causing increased cellular arrest
- This means that as the [Chemotherapeutic Agent] increases, the effectiveness of the Drug (Cell Number) reaches a plateau as when Dose and hence, drug activity increases, the number of cells that undergo Cell Cycle arrest (and hence, become resistant to the Chemotherapy agents) increases, so as these Chemotherapy drugs only act on cells that are progressing through the cell cycle, the proliferation blocking effect of the Chemotherapy drugs means that the therapeutic effects of the drug plateaus as dose increase

![Screenshot 2022-03-27 at 17.37.22.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-27_at_17.37.22.png)

### Growth Fraction (% of Cells Actively Dividing and Diagnostics)

- Cancer Cells in a tumour where a Px is receiving Rx can be divided into 3 groups:
1. Cells that are actively dividing 
2. Cells in G0 that can re-enter the cell cycle and proliferate but are currently not proliferating
3. Cells that are senescent and non-proliferative which cannot re-enter the Cell Cycle in the future
- On Average, a tumour with 10⁹ Cells = 2cm diameter → This is usually the smallest diameter of tumour that can be Dx via Physical Examination or Physiological Alterations
- A Cancer with 10¹² Cells = 20cm Diameter → At this size, the tumour has a major impact on the Px’s Physiology
- As a Cancer Progresses, the proportion of cells that are actively proliferating and going through the Cell Cycle decreases.
- This means that as most Chemotherapy Agents work on cells that are actively proliferating and moving through the Cell Cycle, as a Cancer Progresses, Chemotherapy Agents become less effective as a smaller % of Cells in these tumours are actively targeted and hence, sensitive to damage by Chemotherapy Agents
- This means that Cancers are most effectively Rx early on in their progression as this is when Cancers contain the greatest % of Cells that are actively proliferating and hence, sensitive to destruction by Chemotherapy Agents

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 15.25.30.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_15.25.30.png)

![Screenshot 2022-03-24 at 15.26.11.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-24_at_15.26.11.png)

### Minimal Immune Response

- In types of Anti-Microbial Chemotherapy, the Immune System acts alongside the drug to completely kill the Pathogen to help Rx an Infection completely and prevent any residual bacteria from remaining
- As Malignant Cells are derived by Host Cells, they commonly maintain the same/very similar Phenotype and Ag Expression Profile as the Normal Cell, meaning they are not easily detected by the Immune System so it is harder for the Immune System to support the action of Chemotherapeutics by destroying residual Cancer Cells in order to completely treat an Infection following Rx
- In Addition, many Cancer Chemotherapeutics can produce Bone Marrow Toxicity, which reduces the Ability of the Bone Marrow to synthesise new Immune Cells, further reducing the ability of the Immune System to recognise and destroy Cancerous Cells alongside Chemotherapies
- As Cancer cells can Metastasise, they can hide in immunologically privilege sites such as the Brain where they avoid recognition by the Immune System which further prevents Immune Destruction of Cancerous Cells
- It has been shown that cancerous Cells actively suppress the T Cells response against Cancer Ag to prevent Immune Destruction and therefore, Checkpoint Inhibitions can be used to block these Immunosuppressive Cancerous Molecules to enhance the T Cell Response against Cancerous Cells to help destroy Cancerous Cells
- E.g Ipilimumab and Nivolumab = mAb vs CTLA-4 and mAb vs PD-1

### Extravasation and Tumour Lysis Syndrome

- At High [Chemotherapy], Chemotherapy Agents cause Ulceration and Inflammation and therefore, at Injection Sites where these Chemotherapy Agents are first introduced and then transported around the Body, Transient High [Chemotherapy] can lead to Extravasation and Ulceration Here due to significant tissue damage occurring
- Tumour Lysis Syndrome - Chemotherapy causes Lysis of Large Numbers of Tumour Cells (E.g ALL and Burkitt’s Lymphoma) causing the release of Large Quantities of Intracellular Components such as DNA and Electrolytes (K⁺) into the Plasma, which can contribute to Systemic Inflammation which can damage organs and be life threathening

### Pharmacogenetics

- Pharamcogenetics is the study of genetics and genetic variation on a drug’s action.
- This can impact Cancer Chemotherapy by impacting:
1. Drug Exposure → This can include variation in various proteins involve in Transport, Uptake and Metabolism/Inactivation of Drugs which alters the [Drug] that reaches the Target
2. Px Sensitivity → This can impact the severity and likelihood of Toxicity occurring at a given dose, and can be influenced by other underlying disease
3. Tumour Sensitivity → This can include mechanisms by which a tumour becomes sensitive/resistant to a Rx and its Microenvironment
- Most of these variations are mediated by germline mutations which are inheritable but Tumour Sensitivity can be determined by Somatic Mutations alongside Germline Mutations

![Screenshot 2022-03-27 at 18.00.19.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-27_at_18.00.19.png)

### Cachexia

- Cachexia is a complex syndrome that causes weight loss, muscle loss and decreased BMI
- It is associates with Many Chronic Diseases such as Congestive HF, Chronic Inflammation and Notably in Cancer (50% of all cancer Px show signs of Cachexia)
- The Mechanisms underlying Cachexia are unknown but it is believed that inflammation may be important, with current Rx of Cachexia currently focusing on targeting many pro-inflammatory mediators
- Due to the strain that Cachexia puts on the Body and its effects on body strength, Cachexia reduces the likelihood that a Cancer Px will be able to tolerate a Chemotherapy and its side effects

### Paraneoplastic Syndrome

- These are seen in 8-10% of all Cancer Pxs
- This is a pathology/syndrome seen in Px with Cancer which is not due to the mass effect of the tumour (or treatment), but due to its presence, usually via the production of certain molecules by the tumour such as:
1. Cross reactive antibodies which crossreact with Endogenous Ag to cause an Autoimmune Type reaction
2. Production of biochemical/hormones/transmitters such as Cytokines which can initiate pathogenic responses
3. Interference with normal metabolic pathways
4. Idiopathic
- These syndromes are classified as either:
1. Endocrine
2. Neurological
3. Mucosal-cutaneous
4. Haematological
5. Other

# Drugs Currently Used to Rx Malignancies

### Classic Chemotherapeutic Drugs

- Alkylating agents
- Anti-metabolites
- Cytotoxic antibiotics
- Plant derivatives

### Other Therapies

- Hormone Based Therapies
- Antineoplastic drug (do not fall into other classes)
- Protein kinases inhibitors
- Monoclonal antibodies
- Cell Based Therapies

---

# Alkylating Agents

- Examples: carmustine, estromustine, cyclophosphamide (still
used), melphan, chloramabucil, bulsuphan, treosuphan, cisplatin,
carboplatin, oxaliplatin.
- This includes Nitrogen Mustards, Nitrosoureas, Cisplatin, Platinum and Oxaliplatin
- Alkylating Agents were investigated for their Anti-Cancer Properties after it was noticed that certain members of this class could cause Leukopenia and Lymphopenia (Low WBCs and Bone Marrow Suppression), leading to the usage of Alkylating Agents in the Rx of Haematological Malignancies (Leukaemias and Lymphomas)
- They are generally bifunctional and highly active electrophiles and hence, have very similar general mechanisms of action. but with different specific steps

### Mechanism of Action

- Following the administration of a Bifunctional Alkylator and its entry into the Cell, it loses a Cl⁻ to form an Ethylene Immonium Ion, which can then be converted into a Carbocation
- Both Ethylene Immonium Ions and Carbocations are Electrophilic, so they can be attached by Nucleophilic Sites within DNA
- Depending on the Specific Alkylating Agent, different Alkylation Groups can be formed at Various N, O and other Sites within the DNA-Phosphate Backbone
- Notably, N and O Species within Guanine Residues are susceptible to Alkylation
- As the Alkylator is Bifunctional, the formation of One Covalent bond between Guanine and the Alkylator means that there is another region of the Alkylator that is free to form a covalent bond with another Base and when this occurs, the Bases within DNA are cross-linked

![Screenshot 2022-03-27 at 19.54.42.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-27_at_19.54.42.png)

### Cross-Linking

- Alkylation of DNA Bases can form:
1. Intrastrand Linkage - Crosslinks formed between Bases found within the Same DNA Strand
2. Crosslinkinage between bases in 2 different DNA strands
- Accumulation of these DNA Linkages will eventually inhibit DNA Synthesis within Cancer Cells, preventing Cellular Proliferation and sometimes causing cell death
- As well as this, Alkylation of DNA Residues can inhibit Cancerous Growth via:
1. Cleavage of the Ring Structure of the Nucleotide
2. Abnormal Base Pairing
3. Excision of Guanine Residues via DNA Repair Mechanisms
4. Protein Interactions
- Alkylation is not specific to cancer cells as all cells engage in DNA Synthesis, meaning Alkylation (whilst occurring in a higher rate in Cancer Cells) also occurs within Healthy Cells following the Administration of Alkylating Agents, causing Side Effects → Alkylating Agents are associated with Significant Toxicities (Notably in cells with High proliferation rate like the Bone Marrow) including Blister Formation at their Injection Site

![Screenshot 2022-03-27 at 23.32.24.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-27_at_23.32.24.png)

### Cyclophosphamide and Cisplatin

- Used for the Rx of Leukaemias, Lymphomas and some Neuroblastomas
- Following its Adminsitratin, Cyclophosphamide is converted into 4-Hydroxycyclophosphamide, which is converted into Aldophosphamide within the Liver
- Aldophosphamide can eventually be converted into Phosphamide Mustard, which is the bioactive form of Cyclophosphamide, which can crosslink Base Pairs
- This series of reactions that produces Phosphamide Mustard from Cyclophosphamide also produce Acrolein as a side product, which is a very toxic molecule
- In Aqueous Solutions, Cisplatin loses its Chloride Ion to form an Electrophile which can then crosslink DNA bases via the formation of Covalent Bonds with N and O Species in DNA Bases
- Cisplatin is administered IV and is particularly effective for the Rx of Testicular and Ovarian Cancers
- There have been a number of mechanisms of Drug Resistance that have been identified that means that some Tumour Cells are no longer sensitive to Alkylating Agents:
1. Decreased Permeability of the Cell to the Alkylating Agent
2. Increased production of Glutathione (Antioxidance) which is attacked by the Electrophile Intermediate Ion formed by the Alkylating Agent instead to DNA to prevent DNA Crosslinking from occurring
3. Increased DNA Repair
4. Increased Metabolism of Drugs

---

# Anti-Metabolites

- They tend to be very similar in structure to other DNA Bases or to Nucleosides (e.g 5-Fluorouracil is similar in structure to uracil and Cytosine Arabinoside being similar to Cytosine)
- These compounds compete with the Normal Substrates of the Nucleotide Biosynthetic Pathways and once incorporated, they prevent Nucleotide Synthesis to inhibit DNA or RNA Synthesis

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 00.11.23.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_00.11.23.png)

![Screenshot 2022-03-27 at 23.49.43.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-27_at_23.49.43.png)

- Tetrahydrofolate is an important cofactor in a number of important biochemical pathways, with many Chemotherapy Agents targeting the Folate Pathway to produce their therapeutic effects
- E.g Trimethoprim and Pyrimethamine

### Methotrexate and Folate Pathway

- Folate is influxed into the cell via transporters and once inside, Folate is converted into Tetrahydrofolate, via 2 reactions which are both catalysed by Dihydrofolate Reductase
- Tetrahydrofolate then acts as a cofactor for the activity of Thymidylate Synthase to convert Deoxyuridylic Acid (DUMP) into Deoxythymidylic Acid (DTMP)
- Trimethoprim, Pyrimethamine and Methotrexate all act by Inhibiting the Synthesis of Tetrahydrofolate by inhibiting Dihydrofolate Reductase but they all have different functions as they have differing affinities for Dihydrofolate Reductase in different organisms - Trimethoprim = ABx as it has the highest affinity for Bacterial Dihydrofolate Reductase, Pyrimethamine = Anti-Malarial as it has the highest affinity for Protozoal Dihydrofolate Reductase and Methotrexate = Anti-Cancer as it has the highest affinity for Human Dihydrofolate Reductase
- Methotrexate is a mimic of folic acid that competitively inhibits Dihydrofolate Reductase to prevent Tetrahydrofolate Synthesis
- Methotrexate has been shown to show some selectivity to cancer cells over Human Cells as Methotrexate accumulates within Cancerous Cells but not within Normal Cells
- This accumulation occurs as Glutamate Residues are added to Folate to trap Folate within the Cell to allow it to acccumulate - The enzyme responsible for this is overexpressed in Cancerous Cells and hence, there is excess accumulation of Folate and hence, Methotrexate within Cancerous Cells than Normal Cells
- Mechanism of resistance:
1. ↓ transport into cells via the same transporters that mediate Folate Influx.
2. ↓ affinity of dihydrofolate DHF) reductase for Methotrexate.
3. ↑ levels of DHF reductase.
- Uses: administered orally or I.V.
1. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
2. Burkitt’s lymphoma
3. Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

### 5-Fluorouracil

- Conversion of Deoxyuridylic Acid into Deoxythymidylic Acid via the activity of Thymidylate Synthase involves a transfer of a Methyl Group from Tetrahydrofolate to the Acid
- 5-Fluorouracil is converted into Fluorouracil-Deoxy Uridine by Thymidine Phosphorylase, with Fluorouracil-Deoxy Uridine then complexing with Tetrahydrofolate which allows it to inhibit Thymidylate Synthase to prevent the formation of Deoxythymidylic Acid from Deoxyuridylic Acid
- Mechanism of resistance:
1. ↓ levels of thymidine phosphorylase.
2. ↓ affinity for 5-Fluorouracil.
- Uses: parenteral administration (any non-oral method)
- Breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, hepatic carcinomas.

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 00.13.29.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_00.13.29.png)

### Cytarabine/Cytosine Arabinoside

- Cytosine Arabinoside is a Cytosine Analogue and has a similar mechanism of action to NRTIs
- It is phosphorylated to a Triphosphate Form by Cellular Kinases, which forms the Bioactive form of the Molecule, which can then be incorporated into the Growing DNA Chain where it causes premature Chain Termination and hence, prevent cellular proliferation
- Mechanism of resistance:
1. ↓ levels of deoxycytidine kinase which phosphorylate and hence, activate the Cytosine Arabinoside.
2. ↑ in dCTP.
- Uses: administered oral and I.V.
- Chronic granulocytic leukaemia.

# Cytotoxic Antibiotics

- Example: bleomycin, dactinomycin, doxorubicin

### Doxorubicin and Dactinomycin

- Doxorubicin and Dactinomycin act via Inhibiting Topoisomerase II Activity
- Topoisomerase II creates Nicks in DNA during DNA Replication to allow for the DNA to unwind so that DNA Polymerase can access, bind to and replicate the unwound DNA Segment
- The Nicked Ends of the DNA formed via the activity of Topoisomerase II are particularly vulnerable to damage via ROS so therefore, the cell minimises the time that these nicks are present for by rapidly repairing these nicks via Topoisomerase II
- Doxorubicin and Dactinomycin bind to and inhibit Topoisomerase II to stabilise the Nicked DNA-Topoisomerase Complex, causing DNA to remain in the exposed, nicked form for a longer period of time, increasing the risk of ROS attacking the Nicked Ends of the DNA to denature the DNA, preventing further cell replication and sometimes causing cell death
- Mechanism of resistance:
1. Multidrug resistance → Cause increased efflux of Cytotoxic ABx from the Cell
2. ↑ glutathione peroxidase to increase Glutathione (Antioxidant) production to reduce damage to DNA Nicks via ROS.
3. ↓ topoisomerase
- Uses: administered I.V.
1. Acute lymphocytic leukaemia.
2. Acute granulocytic leukaemia.
- Etoposide is a vinca alkaloid which also inhibits Topoisomerase II.

### Bleomycin and Dactinomycin

- Bleomycin and Dactinomycin can bind to DNA Directly to inhibit DNA Replication and cause cell death by binding to the Minor and Major Grooves of DNA Respectively
- Bleomycin is one of the few chemotherapeutic agents that works in G0 of the Cell Cycle
- Bleomycin is an Iron Chelator that can generate ROS (Notably OH Radicals) via Fenton Chemistry
- When Bleomycin is associated with DNA in its Major Groove, it can cause DNA Denaturation, prevent Cellular Replication and eventually lead to cell death
- Mechanism of resistance:
- ↑ anti-oxidant and DNA repair mechanisms.
- Uses: parenterally administered with t1/2 = 3 hours
- Treatment of testicular and ovarian cancer.
- As Bleomycin generates OH Radicals which can damage tissues, Bleomycin is often associated with serious side effects
- Side effect: 1-2% of patients develop Pulmonary Fibrosis (can be
fatal).

# Plant Derivatives

- Example: Taxol, vincristine, vinblastine.
- These mainly disrupt Microtubule Formation which hence disrupts the formation of the Cytoskeleton
- This Cytoskeleton is involved in Vesicular and Molecular Transport around the Cell, Phagocytosis, Cell Migration and Mitosis
- Microtubules are polymers made up of tubulin dimers, which are in turn comprised of α and β Tubulin Monomers
- Microtubules show Dynamic Instability so that these polymers are being continuously assembled and disassembled within the cell
- While Microtubule Polymers can be extended via the Addition of Tubulin Dimers to the +ve or -ve end of the Microtubules, Dimers preferentially bind to the -ve end
- Plant Alkyloids can modulate the assembly of the Microtubules and hence, impact Mitosis by altering the function/activity of the Microtubules

### Vincristine and Vinblastine

- Vincristine and Vinblastine Bind to the +ve end of the Microtubule Polymer and prevent the further addition of Tubulin Dimers to the Polymer
- This causes Truncation of the Microtubule and eventually, disassembly of the Microtubule and the loss of its function, preventing Mitosis and hence, proliferation from occurring
- Mechanism of resistance:
1. Multidrug resistance
2. Altered tubulin molecules which prevents Vincristine and Vinblastine from binding
- Uses: administered I.V. with t1/2 = 20 hours
1. Childhood leukaemia’s
2. Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
3. Testicular and ovarian carcinomas.
4. Brain tumours

### Taxol

- Taxol binds to and stabilises the Microtubule to cause overelongation of the Microtubule which eventually causes the Microtubule to become dysfunctional/non-functional, preventing the cell from undergoing Mitosis and proliferating
- Mechanism of resistance - Altered tubulin molecules which prevent Taxol from Binding
- Uses: administered I.V.
- Metastatic ovarian and breast cancer.

# Newer Anti-Cancer Drugs

### Imatinib

- In response to pro-proliferative signals, Some Cancer Cells upregulate various Tyrosine Kinases, to increase the activstion of Proliferative TFs to increase the rate of Proliferation
- Mechanism of action: Tyrosine Kinase inhibitor to prevent downstream signalling and hence, excessive proliferation.
- Uses: Oral
- Chronic myelogenous leukaemia for Px where IFN-γ is uneffective.
- Caused by reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 forms the Philadelphia chromosome with a BCR-ABL Fusion gene which encodes a Tyrosine Kinase which is expressed constitutively and is not regulated, causing increased proliferation

### Bortezomib

- Multiple Myeloma is characterised by high proliferation rates and a lack of apoptosis of Cancer Cell
- Mechanism of action: proteasome inhibitor.
- NF𝜅B is expressed by some tumour cells (this is a gene with inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties) which keeps cell immortal by preventing cellular apoptosis.
- I𝜅B𝛼 is inhibitor of NF𝜅B and hence, a pro-apoptotic factor, but this is broken down by cell’s proteasome in Cancer Cells to maintain .NF𝜅B activity.
- Therefore, Bortezomib inhibits proteasome, so [I𝜅B𝛼] ↑, inhibiting NF𝜅B, so tumour cell can undergo apoptosis
- Uses - Multiple Myeloma

# Tumour Treatment (Idealised)

- Initially, the Tumour grows very rapidly, demonstrating a Log-Linear Growth Phase
- At this point, the Tumour is clinically undetectable however, this is the point in the disease progresssion when the Tumour is most susceptible to Rx due to its very high proliferation rate
- When the Tumour has 10⁹ Cells, it become clinically detectable and is Dxed but when the Tumour reaches 10¹² Cells, it is usually fatal
- In Chemotherapy A, each Round of Rx leads to the eradication of 99% of the Tumour and after successive rounds, there is eventually complete eradication of the Tumour
- This therapy can be combined with another tumour Rx Modality like Surgery where Surgery is used to remove the Bulk of the Tumour and remaining cells are destroyed using Chemotherapy
- Initially, Chemotherapy B is successful but over a short amount of time, Cancer develops resistance so growth resumes, leading to an increase in Tumour Mass

### Goldie-Coldman Hypothesis

- Resistance occurs when a mutation within a cancer cells leads to a decreased in the sensitivity of the cell to a Chemotherapeutic Drug. This can be drug specific, drug class, mechanism type or general resistance depending on the specific mutation
- P (Resistance Cell Forming) = Mutation Rate x Number of Tumour Cells

### Effect of Combination Therapy on Resistance

**One Drug**

- A mutation occurs every 100,000 cells that leads to resistance to Chemotherapeutic drug B.
- Detection of Tumours occurs at a mass of 1 gram when it contains 10⁹ cells.
- Therefore, the tumour contains 10000 cells that are resistance to Chemotherapeutic Drug B

**Two Drugs**

- A mutation occurs in every 100,000 cells that leads to resistance to Chemotherapeutic drug A.
- A mutation occurs every 100,000 cells that leads to resistance to Chemotherapeutic drug B.
- No single mutation leads to resistance to both Chemotherapeutic drug A and B so that if a Drug Develops resistance to Chemotherapeutic Drug A, they will still be sensitive to B and vice versa
- Therefore, the probability that a cell will be resistance to Both A and B is 10⁵X10⁵=10¹⁰
- Detection of Tumours occurs at a mass of 1 gram about 10⁹ cells.
- Therefore, there is only 1 in 10 chance that 1 cancer cell is resistance at start of treatment
- Therefore, as the number of drugs used to Rx a Px increases, the probability of success increases as the probability that a single cell is resistant to all Rx significantly decreases

### Modelling Combination Therapy

- In the following, evolutionary model additional parameters include:
1. Tumour size when treatment started
2. Growth rate of tumour
3. Death rate of tumour with drug
4. Number of genes which can lead to drug resistance
- The following model uses values for parameters based on clinical data & uses probabilities of resistance clones arising to determine the success mono and dual chemotherapy treatment
- N = Number of Mutations that can lead to resistance to a Therapy
- Under Normal Conditions, a certain % of Cancer Cells will die (representated by d)
- Blue Lines = Total Number of Cancer Cells and Red Line = Number of Resistance Cancer Cells
- When considering Monotherapies, increasing the Natural Rate of Tumour Death, none of the Monotherapies (Despite Initially being successful) lead to Tumour Eradication as resistant cells develop quite rapidly within the Tumour, which can then proliferate significantly to increase the tumour size
- In Dual Therapy, As the Natural Death Rate of Tumour Cells increases, the Dual Therapy is able to more rapidly eradicate the tumour without the development of resistant cells and hence, the Dual Therapy is more successful

![Screenshot 2022-03-28 at 08.15.55.png](%5BUMP2047%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Chemotherapy%201a94b77192a14e45ac70584eac6ae075/Screenshot_2022-03-28_at_08.15.55.png)

### Conclusions From 2nd Model

- As a Tumour is detected at a progressively later stage (with more cells), the probability of complete tumour eradification decreases as it is more likely that when a tumour is larger, there are already cells present in the tumour that are resistant to the Chemotherapy
- However, at a Given Number of Tumour Cells, the probability of Eradication for Combination Treatment is always higher than that of Monotherapy, with success rate at a given number of Tumour Cells at Dx increasing as the number of Chemotherapeutics used also increases
- Therefore, the probability of tumour eradication depends on
1. The time when treatment started (Number of Tumour Cells present).
2. The use of optimized drug combinations

# Drug Combination

- Analysis and experience appears to indicate combination chemotherapy is a more successful therapy than monotherapy in the Rx of Cancer.
- We must ensure that combination of drugs seen in a Chemotherapy Dual Therapy:
1. Provide an significant therapeutic benefit compared to monotherapy.
2. Do not result in unacceptable toxicity

### General Considerations

- Individual drugs must be active against the tumor
- Drugs must have different modes of action to:
1. Minimize drug resistance from developing
2. Hit cancer cells in different parts of cell cycle
- Drugs must have limited overlapping toxicity to prevent high magnitude toxicity
- Drug additive, synergistic, antagonistic effects must have been investigated to investigate their effectiveness when used in Combination
- Individuals should be optimally scheduled
