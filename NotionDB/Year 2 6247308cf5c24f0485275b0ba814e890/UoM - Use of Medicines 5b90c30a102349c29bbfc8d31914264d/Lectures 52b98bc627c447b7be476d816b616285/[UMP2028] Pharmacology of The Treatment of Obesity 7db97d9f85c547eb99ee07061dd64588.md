# [UMP2028] Pharmacology of The Treatment of Obesity

# Introduction and Obesity Treatment Strategies

### Introduction

- BMI = $\frac{Mass(Kg)}{Height^2(m)}$
- BMI < 18.5: underweight
- BMI 18.5 < ùë• < 25: normal weight
- BMI 25 < ùë• < 30: overweight
- BMI > 30: obese
- **Energy expenditure**:
- **BMR male**: 23.5 kCal/kg
- **BMR female**: 22.5 kCal/kg
- Obesity ‚Üë risk of T2DM.
- Obesity co-morbidities: T2DM, gallstones, hypertension, coronary heart disease.

### Obesity Treatment Strategies - NYC

- Food intake is determined by a combination of homeostatic and hedonic factors:
1. Targeting of peripheral factors that signal energy balance from the GI Tract.
2. Targeting of central nervous pathways.
- Can nutrient absorption be prevented?
1. Consume non-nutritious/low calorie food to satisfy hedonic needs whilst minimising increases in energy interake.
2. Interfere with gut epithelium to reduce calorie uptake.
- energy expenditure:
1. Interfere with mitochondrial function to reduce metabolic efficiency to increase metabolic rate.
- GWAS studies identify ‚Äòobesity genes‚Äô:
- **MC4R** (melanocortin receptor 4): mutation in 5% of obese population.
- **FTO** (fat mass and obesity-associated protein): 16% of Europeans show risk variant for obesity.
- Gastric bypass surgery to ‚Üì capacity to eat.

# Central Control of Bodyweight and Food Intake

### Anorexigenic - Reduce Food Intake

**Peripheral Signals**

- Adiposity Signals = Leptin, Adiponectin (Insulin)
- Satiety Signals released from the GI Tract = GLP-1, PYY, CCK and Gastric Distension

**Central Signals**

- 5-HT
- NA
- Melanocortins (ùõº-MHS)

### Orexigenic - Increase Food Intake

**Peripheral Signals**

- Ghrelin

**Central Signals**

1. NPY, Orexin and AGRP
2. Central Hypoglycaemia
3. Endocannabinoids
4. Emotions - Food as Reward

---

# Central Control - Brain Structures

- Early animal experiments demonstrated:
- Lesion of **ventromedial hypothalamus** causes hyperphagia and obesity (satiety centre).
- Lesion of **lateral hypothalamus** ‚Üì food intake and bodyweight (feeding centre).
- Injection of **glucose antimetabolites** (glucose that cannot be metabolised and hence, mimicks hypoglycaemia) into 4th ventricle induces feeding (brainstem involved in control of food intake).

### Simplified Diagram of Pathways and Receptors Involved in Regulation of Food Intake

- Hypothalamus and Brainstem are involved in Metabolic Regulation of Food Intake
- Mesolimbic System is involved in reward in response to food
- Brainstem (Dorsal Vagal Complex) tends to be where Satiety Pathways originate and received input from Peripheral Satiety Signals and neural input
- Hypothalamus is important for integration of Satiety (via POMC Neurons) and Orexigenic (Agouti-Related Peptide Neurons) Pathways

# Orexigenic Factors

- Neuropeptide Y (NPY): released from neurons within arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, which then project to paraventricular nucleus.
- Inhibit Melanocortins from POMC Neurons Release to inhibit Satiety Pathways to produce Hunger
- This reduced Energy Expenditure and Satiety and stimulates Lipogenesis
- Agouti-related peptide (AgRP): co localises with NPY and is an antagonist of melanocortin system.
- This reduces energy expenditure
- Endocannabinoids: peripheral administration of anandamide ‚Üë
food intake.
- Opioids: may promote rewarding aspects of food (Stimulated Hedonic Feeding)

---

# Anorexigenic Factors

- Melanocortins (E.g ùõº-MSH): made from POMC neurons. ‚Üì food intake and ‚Üë energy expenditure through activation of MC4R.
- ùõº-MSH is synthesised in arcuate nucleus neurons that project to hypothalamus.
- Serotonin (5HT)
- Noradrenaline: ‚Üì food intake through ùõº1 adrenoceptor and ùõΩ adrenoceptor in hypothalamus.
- Nicotine
- CART (cocaine amphetamine regulated transcript)
- Dopamine

---

# Peripheral Mediators

- Leptin: produced by adipose tissue in proportion to the size of lipid stores, providing Adiposity Feedback signalling
- Stimulates POMC Neurons and Inhibits NPY Neurons in the Hypothalamus to produce Satiety
- It also stimulates GLP-1 in the Brainstem to further produce satiety
- Insulin ‚Üì NPY synthesis and stimulates POMC Synthesis to produce Satiety
- Ghrelin: secreted by stomach before a meal when it is empty and is orexigenic
- Signals released by the Gut upon contact of Gut Epithelium with Ingested Food:
- Peptide YY: produced in gut and inhibits feeding.
- Cholecystokinin (CCK): promotes satiety and meal termination
- GLP-1 - Incretin (Stimulates Insulin Release to prevent Postprandial Hyperglycaemia but also terminates meals)

# Targets for Antiobesity Agents

- ‚Üì energy intake:
1. Target central transmitters and/or their receptors.
2. Target peripheral satiety/hunger hormones and/or their receptors.
3. Inhibit fat/nutrient absorption.
- Peripheral Hormonal Activity is usually determined by selective receptor expression in target tissues (As Hormones are present Systemically vs Locally) ‚Üí Specificity is provided by the Molecule itself
- Central Neuronal Activity is usually determined by localisation of Neurotransmitter release (As different isoforms for a neurotransmitter receptor are expressed in wide parts of the Brain, where they can produce different effects) ‚Üí Specificity is provided by localisation of Molecule
- Therefore, it is easier to target peripheral hormonal mechanisms than central neural mechanism to maximise specificity/minimise side effects
- Enhance energy expenditure:
1. Burn energy at cellular level.
2. Stimulate fat mobilisation.
3. Exercise

# Antiobesity Agents

### Historic Agents

1. Thyroid Extract - Increase Metabolic Rate
2. Dinitrophenol - ETC Uncoupler to reduce Metabolic Efficiency
3. Amphetamine - Sympatheticomimetics to increase Energy Expenditure
4. Sibutramine - 5-HT and NA Reuptake Inhibitor
5. Rimonabant - CB1 Receptor Antagonist
6. Orlistat - Gastric Lipase Inhibitor (Reduced Absorption)
7. Lorcaserin - 5-HT2C Receptor Agonist
- These all produced serious side effects, significantly Cardiovascular

### Orlistat

- Currently the only anti-obesity drug that has not been withdrawn from the market due to side effects
- Inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipase and so prevents breakdown of fat to fatty acids and glycerol.
- ‚Üë faecal fat, so patients must adhere to low-fat diet to avoid unpleasant gastric side-effects, which often causes low compliance.
- It produces rapid initial weight-loss, with weight slowly increasing after this but not back to normal levels (Produces Weight Loss but a significant proportion of this weight loss is due to Placebo Effect)
- Lorcaserin also shows a similar pattern of weight loss and Efficacy, reducing the magnitude of weight increase seen after being withdrawn from the drug in comparison to a placebo
- This means that weight loss achieved by medication is usually in the range of 5%, meaning medication are often quite uneffective

# Gastric Bypass Surgery

- Roux-en-Y (Most common form of GBS): complete bypass of stomach and duodenum.
- Small gastric pouch is connected to mid-jejunum.
- Sleeve gastrectomy: significantly ‚Üì size of stomach.
- GBS is a very effective way at ‚Üì patient‚Äôs body weight (around 20-30% weight loss) and is still most effect treatment in obese patients (significantly more effective than drugs).
- Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is the most effective form of GBS, followed by Sleeve Gastrectomy

# Consequences of Gastric Bypass Surgery

### GLP-1

- Fasting GLP-1 levels after these procedures are not altered, including compared with obese patients who experienced similar weight loss achieved by a low-calorie diet (1,300-1,800 kCal/day) or by gastric band.
- Enhanced postprandial GLP-1 responses are observed after a meal even at 1-3 days postoperatively.
- GLP-1 response is ‚Üë after RYGBP than after SG (5x vs 3x respectively), likely due to increased nutrient delivery to the Jejunum, increasing GLP-1 Release.
- Enhanced GLP-1 response was not observed in obese patients who were calorically restricted.
- There is usually a progressive ‚Üë in GLP-1 response during first postoperative year.
- Enhanced GLP-1 responses persist in long term
- Changes in GLP-1 secretion are in stark contrast to relatively unaltered secretion of its incretin counterpart GIP.
- Therefore, increased GLP-1 Signalling has been shown to be central to the effectiveness of GBS
- GLP-1 Agonists (E.g Liraglutide ‚Üí Used in Rx of T2DB) have been shown to produce significant increases in the magnitude of weight loss and the number of Px receiving the drug who experienced weight loss in comparison to Orlistat (Current Gold Standard Weight Loss Drug)
- GLP-1 Agonists are still less effective than GBS

---

# Conclusions

- Utilising neurotransmitters or their receptors as target for weightloss drugs is difficult because of side effects due to widespread expression of neurotransmitter receptors in the brain.
- Targeting circulating factors involved in appetite control might be easier as specificity of action is determined by the molecule/receptor rather than its localisation:
1. GLP-1 mimetics might be a good option.
2. Development of non-peptide (oral) or Gastric-Resistant Peptide GLP-1R agonists would be useful so that these drugs do not have to be administered IV.
- Amount of weight-loss achieved due to pharmaceutical intervention is small.
- Currently gastric bypass is most effective procedure to achieve sustained, substantial weight-loss.
- However, maintained calorie restricted diet achieves same and placebo effect is significant (often due to role of Motivation to Lose Weight in Adherent to Calorie restriction).
- Suggestion: sustained life-style changes (‚Üë exercise and calorie balanced diet) might be best way to a healthy weight and life.
