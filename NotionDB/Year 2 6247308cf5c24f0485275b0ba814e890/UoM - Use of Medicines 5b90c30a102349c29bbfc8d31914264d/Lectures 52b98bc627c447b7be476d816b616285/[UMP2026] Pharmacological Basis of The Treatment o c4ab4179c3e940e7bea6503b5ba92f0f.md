# [UMP2026] Pharmacological Basis of The Treatment of Anxiety and Sleep Disturbance

# Anxiety, Stress and Sleep Disorders

### Anxiety and Stress Disorders

- Panic disorders (PD): unexpected panic attack, worry over future attack, symptoms of racing heart rate, short breath, paraesthesia (tingling sensation), and irrational fear. Agoraphobia (fear of unfamiliar environments where escape might be difficult).
- Phobias: excessive fear triggered by an object (food) or environment (tall buildings, cliffs).
- Social anxiety disorder (SAD): fear of social gatherings, judgement by others, leading to embarrassment.
- Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD): persistent worry and apprehension from diverse sources which can give rise to cognitive dysfunction.
- Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): follows significant trauma, injury, threat to personal well-being, typified by re-living trauma, flashback, negative mood, disrupted cognition.
- Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): disturbing worrying thoughts (terrible event will occur) and need for perfection that are offset by engaging in repetitive, ritualistic behaviour.
- Anxiety is the most common of all mental health disorders

### Sleep Disorders

- Transient insomnia: noise related factors/shirt work patterns/jet lag. Often temporary and self-resolving.
- Intermediate insomnia: emotional or illness related episode (particular stressful). These also tend to be self-resolving but last for a longer amount of time than Transient Insomnia
- Chronic insomnia: associated with psychiatric disorders like, anxiety, depression, drugs, alcohol.

### Pathways

- Arousal of the Sensory System via the Sensory Cortices of the Brain and then to the Thalamus are processed, stimulating the Limbic System (produces Emotional Responses)
- Medial Prefrontal Cortex, Hypothalamus, Amygdala (Important in Anxiety, Stress and Fear Responses), Hippocampus and Brainstem are important in establishing the relationship between Stimuli and Stress/Anxiety
- Stress and Anxiety disorders are characterised by ‚Üë glutamatergic activity: ‚Üë HR, respiratory rate, change in behaviour.
- Therefore, increasing Inhibition of Hyperactive Glutamatergic Systems can correct the Physiological Sx of Stress and Anxiety Disorders

# Neurotransmitters and Receptors

### Ionotropic Receptors

- GABA and inhibition: site of actions of barbiturates and benzodiazepines.
- ‚Üë GABAergic activity ‚Üì anxiety and promotes sleep.
- GABA-A Receptors are also found outside the synapse, where they have a Œ¥ vs Œ≥ subunit and sense low levels of GABA to produce a tonic inhibition to control long term cell excitability
- Their lack of Œ≥ subunit means that BDZ and Z Drugs cannot bind to and hence, activate these Extrasynaptic GABA-A Receptors
- Ubiquitous distribution throughout brain, meaning they are a common Drug target.
- Glutamate: major excitatory transmitter via AMPA(R), NMDA(R) and metabotropic receptors (mGluRs).
- It is a Complex System as both potentiation/inhibition of NMDARs confers anxiolysis (anxiety relief).
- No approved drugs for Anxiety target the Glutamatergic System.

### GPCRs

- Serotonin (5HT): projections from raphe nucleus to forebrain. ‚Üë serotonergic drive ‚Üì anxiety.
- Large receptor family (14 subtypes).
- Agonists at 5-HT1A receptors are anxiolytic.
- Noradrenaline (norepinephrine): projections from locus coeruleus (pons) to forebrain.
- These pathways are upregulated in anxiety.
- Mediates physiological effects of anxiety, predominantly but may also directly produce anxiety via ùú∑-ARs.
- Antagonists of ùú∑-adrenoceptors are
anxiolytic.
- Dopamine (DA): projections from mid brain (ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra) to cortex, striatum and limbic nuclei.
- Complex role, upregulated in anxiety.
- Blocking D2 receptors is anxiolytic (anti-psychotic).

# GABA Pharmacology - Anxiety and Insomnia

### Benzodiazepines

- Bind to GABA-A receptors (GABARs). ‚Üë inhibition at synapses.
- Receptor is a pentamer with subunit structure Œ±‚ÇÇŒ≤‚ÇÇŒ≥.
- 2 GABA molecules bind to one GABA-A receptor at 2 sites between the Œ± and Œ≤ subunits, where it activates the  receptor, allowing Cl‚Åª to flow into cell.
- These rapidly hyperpolarises cell, driving down excitation.
- Benzodiazepine bind to a single different site (not the same as GABA), between ùõº and ùõæ subunit alongside 2 x GABA.
- This allow more Cl‚Åª to flow into the cell, by opening channel more frequently, to increase the magnitude of inhibition produced (Positive Modulators of GABA-A).

### Structure and Effects

- Sedation (anxiolytic)
- Hypnosis
- Muscle relaxation
- Anti-convulsant (treatment of epilepsy)
- Amnesia

### What do they do?

- Effect of GABA on the GABA-A Receptor
- [Red] GABA with BDZ. Doesn‚Äôt compete with GABA binding sites as Benzodiazepine binding site is unique.
- Shifts dose-response curve to left, making GABA more potent at synapse (EC50 drops).
- [Brown] GABA with BDZ competitive antagonist (flumazenil - often used in BDZ overdose).
- This reverses effect of BDZ agonist by preventing it from binding to the BDZ Site and acting as a Positive Allosteric Modulator here, restoring the Dose-Response Curve back to the same position as it was when no BDZ was present.
- [Green] GABA with BDZ inverse agonist (ùú∑-carbolines) that binds to the BDZ site.
- Shifts curve to right hand side, making GABA less potent
- Only BDZ agonist and antagonist are clinically relevant as GABA Inverse Agonists can increase risk of Convulsants.

| Benzodiazepine | Duration (Hours) | Active Metabolite | Uses |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Midazolam (Half Life = 3 Hrs) | 4 | -OH | Amnesic, Pre-Med Surgery (Endoscopy) |
| Lorazepam, Oxazepam and Temazepam | 15 |  | Anxiolytic, Hypnotic |
| Alprazolam (Half Life = 24 Hrs) and Nitrazepam | 24 | -OH | Anxiolytic, Panic Attacks and Hypnotic |
| Chlordiazepoxide/Librium and Diazepam (Half Life = 20 Hrs) | 48 | Nordiazepam (-Me + =O) | Anxiolytic, Muscle Relaxant and Anticonvulsant (Diazepam) |
| Clonazepam and Flurazepam (Half Life = 1 Hrs) | 60 | Desmethy (-Me) | Anticonvulsant and Anxiolytic (Clonazepam) Anxiolytic (Flurazepam) |
- Diazepam and flurazepam duration is significantly longer than their half-lives, because they are converted to active metabolites that have a long duration of action.
- Uses of Benzodiazepines is mainly based on their duration of action (Pre-med = Short Half Life for short effect to reduce consciousness, Anxiolytic = Intermediate Half Life for duration during the Day, Anticonvulsant = Long Half Life to provide continuous/sustained inhibition of Cerebral Activity to prevent against epilepsy and muscle spasticity)

### Benzodiazepine Adverse/Side Effects

| Unwanted Side Effects | Tolerance | Dependence | Toxic Adverse Effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Confusion | Factor of Receptor Occupancy | Major Problem in Clinical Use | Overdose |
| Drowsiness | Factor of Dose Duration | Rebound Anxiety with Abrupt Withdrawal | Prolonged Sleep |
| Forgetful | Surface Receptor Numbers | Tremor | Less Dangerous than Barbiturates |
| Muscle Incoordination (Often due to Muscle Relaxation) |  | Apetite Loss | Respiratory Depression with Ethanol |
| Day After Impairment (E.g Falls) |  | Disrupted Sleep | Safeguard of Flumazenil as a competitive BDZ Antagonist to reverse overdose |
| Driving or Manual Skill Impairment |  | Slow Onset of Dependency unlike Opioids  |  |
|  |  | Limited Craving |  |
|  |  | Gradual/Tapered Withdrawal of the Drug minimises risk of Dependence |  |

# Endogenous Neural Anxiolytics In the Brain

### Neurosteroids (Allosteric Modulator)

- Allopregnanolone and tetrahydro deoxycorticosterone:
- These are derived from Progesterone and Corticosterone
- Endogenous Allosteric modulaters of GABA-A receptor.
- Consist of 4 Connected Rings, 2 Methyl Groups that stick out above the plane of the Rings, and 2 Polar Groups that are attached to the Rings at each end of the molecule
- This regular basic structure allows for Anxiolytic drugs to be developed from these Neurosteroids
- These are synthesised by Glia and Presynaptic Neurons, released in a Paracrine Manner
- At low [ ], they bind between Œ± and Œ≤  Subunits on Synaptic GABA-A Subunit but deeper down in the Transmembrane Domain (GABA also binds between these subunits but at the Extracellular Domain)
- They also bind to Extrasynaptic GABA-A Receptors at a site between their Œ± and Œ¥ subunits
- After binding, they promote Cl‚Åª influx to suppress synaptic transmission/excitability of neurons and tonic discharge respectively
- Function (Similar to BDZ):
1. Anxiolytic
2. Sedative/hypnotic
3. Anticonvulsant
4. Motor incoordination
- When there is defective/changes in Neurosteroid Production:
1. Stress responses
2. Premenstrual stress disorder (Notably due to Variations in [Allopreganolone] in the Female Menstrual Cycle)
3. Sleep regulation
4. Neuronal development
5. Ethanol/drug intoxication
6. Catamenial epilepsy (Due to low [Allopreganolone] during the Menstrual Cycle)
7. Depression
8. Pain

### Diazepam Binding Inhibitor Protein (DBI)

- Endozepines: bind between ùõº and ùõæ subunits (BDZ Site) to potentiate the activity of GABA at GABA-A to produce anxiolytic effects
- Due to this, their activity can also be blocked by Flumazenil
- These are prodominantly found in the Thalamic Reticular Nucleus
- Due to their complex peptide structure, it is hard to formulate Anxiolytic Drugs which mimic the action of DBI

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 18.42.32.png](%5BUMP2026%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20The%20Treatment%20o%20c4ab4179c3e940e7bea6503b5ba92f0f/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_18.42.32.png)

# Other Anxiolytics

### Serotonergic System

- 5HT1A is inhibitory autoreceptor found on the Soma and Dendrites of 5-HT nerves and produces postsynaptic inhibition by inhibiting adenylate cyclase presynaptically via Gi/Go.
- Buspirone: 5HT1A partial agonist.
- Desensitises presynaptic 5HT1ARs.
- Very slow onset (weeks) as receptor desensitisation is a slow process.
- Effective for generalised anxiety disorder but not for phobias.
- Less problematic side effects in comparison to BDZs (No tolerance and addiction):
1. Dizziness
2. Headache
3. Nausea
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 18.43.35.png](%5BUMP2026%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20The%20Treatment%20o%20c4ab4179c3e940e7bea6503b5ba92f0f/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_18.43.35.png)
    
- Buspirone desensitises 5HT1A receptor.
- In the acute setting, Buspirone stimulates presynaptic 5-HT1A to increase presynaptic inhibition of 5-HT Neuron to reduce the frequency of AP generation and hence Serotonergic Transmission, reducing Postsynaptic Inhibition due to reduced stimulation of Postsynaptic 5-HTRs
- Inhibition of a postsynaptic inhibitory receptor (Disinhibition)
- Initially patient‚Äôs symptoms are worse (because rate of firing is inhibited which
worsens symptoms of anxiety).
- In the chronic setting, desensitisation of Presynaptic 5-HT1A reduces Presynaptic Inhibition of Serotonergic Neurons. This increases AP Firing Rate and hence, Serotonergic Transmission, increasing Postsynaptic Inhibition to produce Anxiolytic effects

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 18.44.29.png](%5BUMP2026%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20The%20Treatment%20o%20c4ab4179c3e940e7bea6503b5ba92f0f/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_18.44.29.png)

### Adrenergic System

- ùõΩ adrenoceptor antagonists are Anxiolytic
- Propranolol: (treats symptoms by likely acting centrally and peripherally)
1. Anxiety with clear physical signs.
2. Sweating
3. Tremor
4. Tachycardia
5. Peripheral autonomic effects

### Anti-Depressants

- Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - Fluoxetine and Paroxetine
- Serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) - Venlafaxine and Duloxetine
- Used for GAD, SAD, PTSD, phobias as they Increase Postsynaptic Serotonergic Inhibition to produce Anxiolytic effects.

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 18.47.20.png](%5BUMP2026%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20The%20Treatment%20o%20c4ab4179c3e940e7bea6503b5ba92f0f/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_18.47.20.png)

### Anti-Convulsants

- Tigabine: blocks GABA uptake. Raises GABA levels at inhibitory synapses.
- Valproate: blocks GABA metabolism. So more GABA in neurones.
- Used for GAD.

### Anti-Psychotics

- Olazapine: antagonise D2 receptors linked to Gi. Inhibits adenylate cyclase, ‚Üì cAMP, PKA activity.
- Risperidone
- Used for GAD and PTSD.

# Other Hypnotics and Historical Drugs

### Others

- Chlormethiazole: acts via GABA receptors (potentiates them).
- Used as hypnotic only for elderly: no hangover effect to reduce the risk of falls and confusion.
- General advice on use of hypnotics:
- Short term treatment with hypnotics preferred.
- Tolerance develops over 2 weeks.
- Withdrawal: rebound insomnia, vivid dreams (can last weeks).

### Historical Drugs

**Barbiturates**

- Act via GABA-A receptors (and can directly activate receptor as well as acting as Positive Modulators at GABA-A in response to Endogenous GABA).
- Due to their strong effects on GABAergic Transmission, they would produce significant sedation and memory impairment so that Px forgot they already took their dose and took another dose, with this cycle repeating and often leading to Overdoses
- Induction of Anaesthesia: thiopental
- Severe intractable insomnia: amylobarbitone, secobarbital, butobarbital.
- Epilepsy: phenobarbitone
- Can produce respiratory depression which cannot be reversed as there is no Direct Antagonist which can be used in situations of overdose (and hence, are riskier in situations of Overdose).
- Not for use in elderly who may forget they have taken their dose already and are at risk of overdose or for sedation as they are too potent.

### Non-Prescription Anxiolytics/Sedatives

- Antihistamines: H1 receptor antagonists. Sedation, hypnotic.
- Diphenhydramine
- Promethazine
- Tolerance to these H1 Antagonists can quickly develop
- Valarian extract (Valeriana officinalis)
- Valerenic acid
- Potentiates GABA receptor function.

---

# Future Developments

- Receptor specific therapies
- GABA-Rs can contain various different isoforms of the various subunit types ‚Äì Œ±1-6, Œ≤1-3, Œ≥1-3
- Œ±2 subunit-containing GABA receptors
important for anxiolytic action of BDZs and hence, selective targeting of Œ±2-expressing GABA-A Receptors can produce selective Anxiolytic Actions without producing side effects (E.g Sedating, Amnesia, Muscle Relaxation)
