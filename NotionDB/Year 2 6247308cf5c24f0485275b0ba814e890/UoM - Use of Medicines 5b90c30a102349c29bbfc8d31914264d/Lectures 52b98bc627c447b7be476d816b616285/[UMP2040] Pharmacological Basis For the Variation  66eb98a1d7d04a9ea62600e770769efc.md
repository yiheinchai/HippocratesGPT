# [UMP2040] Pharmacological Basis For the Variation in Drug Response

# Factors Contributing to Altered Drug Effects In Elderly

- As we age:
- Total Body Water decreases
- The fraction of Lipophilic Drug found within Adipose Tissue increases
- Capacity of Hepatic Drug Metabolism peaks in Young Adults but is low either side
- Capacity of Renal Elimination peaks in Young Adults but is low either side

### Altered Drug Absorption and Disposition

- ‚Üì gastric acid.
- ‚Üì lean body mass.
- ‚Üë % body fat.
- ‚Üì liver mass and blood flow.
- ‚Üì renal function.

### Altered Response to Drugs

- Altered receptor and/or postreceptor properties.
- Impaired sensitivity of homeostatic mechanisms.
- Common diseases: diabetes, arthritis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, cancer, glaucoma.

### Social and Economic Factors

- Inadequate nutrition
- Multiple-drug therapy.
- Non-compliance

# Drug-Disease Interactions

| Drug | Disease |
| --- | --- |
| NSAIDs | GI tract haemorrhage, ‚Üë BP, renal impairment. |
| Digoxin | Dysrhythmias |
| Levothyroxine | Coronary Artery Disease |
| Prednisone and Other Glucocorticoids | Peptic Ulcer Disease. |
| Verapamil and Diltiazem | Congestive Heart Failure |
| Propranolol and Other ùú∑-Blockers | Congestive Heart Failure, Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. |

# Basic Factors Affecting Response

- Difference in drug disposition: pharmacokinetics. For a given dose, different drug concentrations at site of action.
- Differences in response mechanism: different responses for same concentration at site of action.

---

# Pharmacokinetic Differences

### Drug Absorption

- Variation in extent and rate.
- Disease affecting structure of mucosa.
- Example: coeliac disease (immune damage to villi reducing SA of the Small Intestines), diarrhoea, vomiting.
- Surgery ‚Üí Region of the SI is removed, reducing the length and hence, SA of the SI
- Interaction with other drugs or food in gut.
- Example: Griseofulvin (antifungal) is absorbed better with a fatty meal.
- Compliance: patient may not be taking drug properly, or perhaps not at all.

### Drug Distribution

- Drug concentration in body will be determined by volume of distribution and hence by body size.
- It is appropriate to adjust dose to body weight to achieve optimal plasma concentration.
- Composition of body might also influence drug distribution.
- Obesity and oedema change the relative proportions of lipid and water within the body.
- Fat soluble drugs likely to be sequestered in adipose tissue.
- Plasma protein binding of drugs might also vary if the disease process alters the concentration of Plasma Binding Proteins.

# Calculation of Child Dose

- CD (child‚Äôs dose), AD (adult‚Äôs dose), CA (child‚Äôs age), CW (child‚Äôs weight), SA (surface area).

### According to Age

- Young‚Äôs Formula ‚Üí $CD = \frac{CA(Years)}{CA(Years)+12}√óAD$
- Used for children < 12 years of age.
- Dilling‚Äôs Formula ‚Üí $CD = \frac{CA(Years)}{20}AD$
- Fried‚Äôs Rule ‚Üí $CD=\frac{CA(Months)}{150 (Months)}√óAD$
- Used predominantly for infant‚Äôs dose calculation.

### According to Body Weight

- Clark‚Äôs Rule ‚Üí $CD=\frac{Cw(Kg)}{70}√óAD$

### According to Body Surface Area

- $CD = \frac{SA of Child}{SA of Adult}√óAD$
- Mosteller formula to calculate Body Surface Area ‚Üí

# Changes in Plasma Protein Concentration in Disease

- Certain conditions can ‚Üë or ‚Üì levels of plasma proteins.
- This affects whether drug can bind to plasma proteins or remain free in plasma and hence, alters the Free [ ] of the Drug in the Plasma (notably significant for Drugs with Low Therapeutic Index and high degree of Plasma Protein Binding like Warfarin where small changes in Free [Warfarin] produce large changes in Therapeutic Action).

### Effect of Protein Glycosylation on Binding of Sulfisoxazole to Plasma Proteins

- In diabetics, glycosylation ‚Üë, so ‚Üì drug binds to plasma proteins.
- Œ±-AGP = Œ±1 Acidic Glycoprotein

# Drug Elimination

- Probably major cause of variation in dosage requirements.
- Firstly, changes in drug metabolism with age.
- There are incompletely developed drug elimination systems in neonates, meaning that elimination is slower in neonates

## Differences in Drug Metabolism with Age

### Newborn

- Glucuronidation (conjugation reaction) is not fully developed at birth, meaning that Chloramphenicol (and other drugs) cannot be metabolised into a soluble form and hence, excreted.
- Moreover, they have inadequate renal excretion mechanism, which further allows Chloramphenicol to accumulate in the Blood, resulting in higher plasma concentrations and toxicity (most commonly seen in Premature Babies, where these elimination mechanism are further underdeveloped).
- A consequence is cyanosis (Due to Deoxy-Hb in Superficial Vessels) and the passage of loose, green tinted stools, so called ‚ÄòGray syndrome‚Äô.
- This usually presents 2-4 days after Rx and after 24 hrs, the babies start vomiting, refuse feeding, have Irregularly and Rapid Breathing and a Swollen Abdomen
- In the Long Term, babies turn an Ashen-Green Tint, flaccid paralysis occurs and Hyperthermic
- A Similar Syndrome has been reported in Adults when they overdose with Chloramphenicol

### Elderly

- General impairment of hepatic function.
- Dosage required in elderly are often significantly less than in younger adults due to reduced Hepatic Metabolism of drugs which leads to their inactivation/elimination, meaning Plasma [ ] following a set dose is higher in the elderly than young adults
- As age ‚Üë, t1/2 can also ‚Üë, which increases the risk of drug accumulation when multiple doses are taken, which can lead to Overdose

### Liver Disease

- Predictably ‚Üì hepatic function will ‚Üì rate of elimination of drugs metabolised by liver.

# Pharmacogenetics

- Genetic difference in enzymes involved in drug metabolism can result in a wide variation in rate of metabolism.
- Variations may be continuous or discontinuous (produce bimodal distribution of Plasma [ ] across a population due to population with normal enzyme and abnormal enzyme ‚Üí 2nd Peak at Higher [ ] is usually due to population with Mutation that impairs its function).

![Screenshot 2022-02-13 at 12.51.07.png](%5BUMP2040%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20the%20Variation%20%2066eb98a1d7d04a9ea62600e770769efc/Screenshot_2022-02-13_at_12.51.07.png)

- Phenytoin: dosage requirements are quite variable, necessitating a careful adjustment of dose.
- Eliminated by zero-order kinetics.
- Variations are found in both Vmax and Km
- 2 well-known examples of bimodal distribution (discontinuous variation) of rates of metabolism:
1. Atypical plasma cholinesterase: As Suxamethonium is metabolised by Plasma Cholinesterase, ‚Üì activity of Plasma Cholinesterase causes prolonged action of Suxamethonium, producing a prolonged neuromuscular block.
2. Acetylator status: rates of acetylation (conjugation reaction) of drugs like Isoniazid and Procainamide‚Üí In Px with Acetylators with a fast rate of reaction, Plasma [ ] is much lower than that seen with Px with Slow Acetylators as the rapid acetylators are able to rapidly conjugate the drug and hence, inactivate it/allow it to be excreted.
- These distributions can be found within populations of different nationalities

# Personalised Medicine

- This assess Clinical, Genetic and Environment Factors that determines individual Pharmacokinetics to personalise drug dosage and frequency of doses in order to more rapidly achieve a stable Plasma [ ] that is safe and therapeutically active (whilst also minimising Side Effects) ‚Üí This is commonly used in the Rx of Cancer, where there are specific biomarkers whose expression is altered
- However, Personalised Medicine has not yet been successful for Neurological Conditions (Especially significant for those with Non-Responsive Conditions)
- Genome Wide Association Studies alongside Metabolome Analysis can identify new Genetic Mutations that may give rise to Drug Resistant Neurological Conditions and hence, may act as Therapeutic Targets to Rx these Conditions

# Differences in Drug Metabolism Due to Drug Interaction

- Many drugs can either inhibit metabolism of other drugs or ‚Üë metabolism by enzyme induction.

### Changes in Renal Excretion

- Changes are found with age, and as expected, with renal failure.
- Renal function is not fully developed in neonates and GFR starts to ‚Üì beyond 25 years of age.

### Influence of Age on t1/2 of Antibiotics

- t1/2 in neonates and Px with Renal Disease is ‚Üë due to reduced capacity to excrete the drug, causing it to persist in the plasma for longer (longer t1/2).

### Effect of Kidney Disease on t1/2 of Antibiotics Excreted Predominantly in Urine

![Screenshot 2022-02-13 at 12.53.48.png](%5BUMP2040%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20the%20Variation%20%2066eb98a1d7d04a9ea62600e770769efc/Screenshot_2022-02-13_at_12.53.48.png)

- t1/2 ‚Üë in severe kidney disease.

### Effect of Renal Disease on t1/2 of Tetracycline

![Screenshot 2022-02-13 at 12.54.28.png](%5BUMP2040%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20For%20the%20Variation%20%2066eb98a1d7d04a9ea62600e770769efc/Screenshot_2022-02-13_at_12.54.28.png)

- t1/2 ‚Üë with worsening renal disease.

---

# Adjustment of Dose for Renal Disease

- It is possible to estimate degree of renal impairment by measuring creatinine clearance and adjust dose of drug accordingly.

# Differences in Tissue Response to a Drug

1. Down regulation of receptors: prolonged exposure to agonist can ‚Üì number of receptors in membrane in an attempt to normalise receptor signalling.
- In asthma patients, continued use of ùõΩ-adrenoceptor agonist (salbutamol) can produce tolerance which correlates with ‚Üì in ùõΩ-adrenoceptor density.
- In heart failure, there are fewer ùõΩ-adrenoceptors in myocardium.
1. Up regulation of receptors due to stimulation by other mediators:
- Thyroxine treatment can ‚Üë ùõΩ-adrenoceptor density in heart. This contributes to cardiac effects in
hyperthyroidism.
- Oestrogen can ‚Üë density of oxytocin receptors in uterine smooth muscle (normal change during pregnancy).
1. Presence of Anti-receptor antibodies increasing the effectiveness of Antagonists and decreasing the effect of Agonists:
- Example: myasthenia gravis - Tubocurarine (Reduced nAChR Stimulation) is more effective and Suxamethonium (Stimulates nAChRs to produce depolarising block) is less effective
1. Receptor desensitisation: in continued presence of a high [agonist], desensitisation may occur:
- Receptor can switch to desensitised conformation which does not responds to agonist (nicotinic receptor).
- Receptor is phosphorylated to a non-functional state (many GPCRs).
1. Adaptive changes: where a drug interferes with a control system (e.g. BP), homeostatic mechanisms may come into play to minimise disturbance and restore homeostasis.
- This is probably a further feature of opiate tolerance

### Altered Drug Response in the Elderly

- Increased Response to Drugs can produce side effects (E.g BDZ and Barbiturates ‚Üí Increased Sedation and Confusion) that cannot be explained by altered Pharmacokinetics

# Guidelines For Drug Prescribing in Elderly

- Many drugs exhibit narrow therapeutic index in elderly.
- Use non-pharmacological approaches when possible.
- Use lowest possible dose and smallest dose increment (start slow, go slow) to establish therapeutic dose with minimal side effects.
- Use smallest number of medications to minimise drug interaction.
- Regularly review drug treatments and potential interactions.
- Recognise any new symptoms.

---

# Summary

- A wide variation in drug dosage requirements is found. Importantly:
1. Differences in body weight.
2. Differences in drug elimination.
3. Down-regulation of receptors.
- How do you adjust for these differences
1. Adjust dose for weight.
2. Titrate dose until required effect is obtained.
3. Measure plasma concentration of drug
