# [UMP2010] Clinical Pharmacology of Congestive Heart Failure

# Definitions and Diagnostic Criteria

**Physiological Definition**

- Failure of the heart and its compensatory mechanisms to provide sufficient blood flow to meet metabolic demand

**Clinical Definition**

- A complex clinical syndrome that results from any structural or functional impairment of ventricular filling or ejection of blood
- Because some patients present without symptoms or signs of volume overload, the term ‘heart failure’ is preferred over ‘congestive heart failure’

### Diagnostic Criteria

| Symptoms | Signs on Examination | Tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reduced Exercise Tolerance | Elevated JVP | Echocardiogram (Looking for Signs of Impaired EF or Diastolic Dysfunction) |
| Orthopnoea (Shortness of breath when lying on your back, relieved by sitting or standing) | Bibasal Crepitations (Bilateral Crackles in the Lung Bases) | Serum B-Type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) Levels - Often used as an Initial Screening Test |
| Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnoea (Sudden, Random Bursts of Dyspnoea at Night, often when Sleeping) | Peripheral Oedema |  |
| Fatigue | Ascites (Abdominal Oedema due to Severe Heart Failure) |  |
| Ankle Swelling | S3 |  |
|  | Hepatomegaly (Due to Fluid Overload) |  |

# Symptoms and Frank-Starling Curve

### Symptoms

- In Left Heart Failure, Reduced Ejection of Blood from the Left Ventricle into the Systemic Circulation can cause Blood to pool/accumulate in the Left Ventricle, causing Left Ventricular End Diastolic Pressure to increase which reduced the Pressure Gradient driving the Return of Blood to the LV from the Lungs, causing Blood to remain in the Pulmonary Circulation
- When this occurs in the Pulmonary Circulation, this can lead to Pulmonary Venous Congestion which increases Pulmonary Hydrostatic Pressure, causing Pulmonary Oedema which leads to Cough and Frothy Sputum, Orthopnoea and Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnoea
- Decreased Cardiac Output can lead to Activity Intolerance and Signs of Decreased Tissue Perfusion.
- When very severe, HF can present with Cyanosis and Signs of Hypoxia
- When Left Heart Failure is so severe, Severe Venous Congestion can reduce the Ability of the Right Side of the Heart to eject blood into the Pulmonary Circulation, leading to Right Heart Failure
- When there is Right Heart Failure, Reduced Stroke Volume causes Blood to accumulate/pool within the Right Ventricle, which increases Right Ventricular End Diastolic Pressure
- This decreases the Pressure Gradient driving the return of Blood from the Systemic Venous Circulation into the RV, causing Venous Blood to Pool within Peripheral Tissues
- This Systemic Venous Congestion leads to Peripheral Oedema and Ascites.
- Venous Congestion within the GI Tract can lead to Anorexia/Reduced Apetite and Weight Loss
- Hepatic Congestion can lead to Hepatomegaly and/or Impaired Liver Function

### Frank-Starling Curve

- When plotting Preload (LVEDP) against Stroke Volume, the Height of the Curve Decreases
- This means that with increasing Preload, there is a reduced rate of increase of Stroke Volume

# Classification

- Heart Failure can be classified using the Ejection Fracture
- There are very few Pharmacological Treatments that have shown to be effective in the Management of Diastolic Heart Failure/Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fracture

| Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fracture | Heart Failure with Mid-Range Ejection Fracture | Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sx and Signs | Sx and Signs | Sx and Signs |
| LVEF < 40% | LVEF 40-49% | LVEF ≥ 50% |
|  | Elevated Natriuretic Peptides (ANP and BNP) | Elevated Natriuretic Peptides (ANP and BNP) |
|  | Structural Heart Disease/Diastolic Dysfunction on an Echocardiogram | Structural Heart Disease/Diastolic Dysfunction on an Echocardiogram |

# Pathophysiology and Pharmacology

### Pathophysiology

1. HF Causes a Reduction in CO
2. This triggers the Baroreceptor Reflex, increasing SNS Outflow
3. This increases Na⁺ and H₂O retention directly and via RAAS Activation
4. SNS Outflow also activates RAAS
5. SNS Outflow also causes Cardiac Remodelling
6. SNS Outflow causes Increased Afterload which further reduces CO
7. Reduced CO reduces Renal Perfusion, which further stimulates the RAAS
8. AT2 can directly cause Cardiac Remodelling and Vasoconstriction
9. Aldosterone can directly cause Cardiac Remodelling and can increase Na⁺ and H₂O retention, which further increases Preload

# Causes

1. Ischaemic Heart Disease (Most Common Cause)
2. Arrhythmias (Atrial Fibrillation)
3. Chronic Hypertension (Leads to Cardiac Remodelling which can lead to Heart Failure)
4. Idiopathic (Dilated Cardiomyopathy - More Rare. This can sometimes be caused by Alcohol)
5. Valvular Heart Disease

---

# Prognosis

- This establishes different classes of Heart Failure based on Sx and the limitations that they impose on daily functioning

| NYHA Class | Sx | Adjusted Hazard Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I | No Sx and No limitation in Ordinary Physical Activity | 1 |
| II | Mild Sx (Mild Dyspnoea and/or Angina) with Slight Limitation during Ordinary Activity | 1.54 |
| III | Marked Limitation in Activity due to Sx, even in less-than-ordinary activity/Normal Daily Activity (E.g Walking Short Distances). The Px is only comfortable at rest | 2.56 |
| IV | Severe Limitations. Experiences Sx even while at rest. These Px are mainly bed bound | 8.4 (50% 1 Year Risk of Death) |

---

# Causes of Acute Decompensation

- Acute Decompensation = Sudden Deteriorations/Exacerbations of Symptoms

**Causes of Acute Decompensation of Stable Chronic Heart Failure:**

Common

1. Tachyarrhythmias
2. Ischaemic Events
3. Hypertensive Crises
4. Increased Salt and Fluid Intake

Rarer

1. Hyperthyroidism 
2. Anaemia
3. Sepsis

---

# Trajectory of Chronic Heart Failure

- Px are often diagnosed when Heart Failure is Mild and the Heart is still functioning well
- Over time, the Heart Failure slowly worsens and causes a gradual reduction in Heart Functioning, which causes Sx to gradually get worse
- Acute Decompensations may occur as the Heart begins to slowly decline in function, Characterised by Pronounced sudden drops in Heart Function, after which the Px recovers back to a Similar Level of Heart Function
- Sentinel Events = Acute Decompensation Events
- The End Stage of Chronic Heart Failure is usually when Px undergo Acute Decompensation in Heart Function from which they do not recover, causing Heart Function to drop rapidly and not recover, leading to Death
- Stage 1 = Physically Well
- Stage 2 = Active Pharmacological Management of HF required
- Stage 3 = Palliative Care

# Pharmacological Management

1. ACEi (or ARB if Px does not tolerate ACEi well)+ β-Blocker + Loop Diuretic
2. If Px cannot Tolerate ARB/ACEi, give Vasodilator (Hydralazine or Nitrates) + Loop Diuretic
3. If after initial Rx, the Px still has NYHA II-IV, Give the Px a Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist (E.g Spironolactone)
4. If Px still has NYHA II-IV and a LVEF ≤ 35%, give Sacubitril Valsartan
5. If on an ECG, Px has a QRS Complex with a Duration > 130 ms, consider CRT-D (Cardiac Pacemaker and Defibrillator)
- Diuretics (Loop and Thiazide) are used as needed for Symptomatic Relief due to Fluid Overload in the Circulation but do not increase survival in Heart Failure

# Diuretics

- These act to Decrease Na⁺ and H₂O retention, to decrease ECV and Preload, hence preventing an increase in Cardiac Work and reducing the Volume of Fluid that is pooling in the Veins (Reduces Fluid Overload)
- Loop Diuretics are usually the main class of Diuretics Prescribed in Heart Failure but in Severe Cases of Heart Failure, Thiazides may also be prescribed

### Loop Diuretics

- Block NKCC2 in TALH
- This increases Na⁺,K⁺ and Cl⁻ Excretion by reducing their uptake here, causing increased H₂O excretion osmotically from the Blood into the Urine (Reducing ECV)
- Whilst these do not improve survival in Heart Failure, they do reduce the Sx that present due to Fluid Overload (Oedema etc.)

### Thiazide Diuretics

- Blocks NCC in DCT
- This increases NaCl excretion which increases H₂O excretion osmotically from the Blood into the Urine (Reduces ECV)

| Example | Furosemide (Loop), Metolazone (Thiazide). Metolazone is used in Advanced Heart Failure |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Decrease Na⁺ and Water Retention by Blocking NKCC2 in TALH and NCC in DCT respectively |
| Effect | Increased Diuresis (Osmotic Diuresis) |
| Side Effect | Hyponatraemia, Hypokalaemia, Renal Impairment |
| Indication | All NYHA Classes |
| Key Trials | No significant difference in efficacy or safety endpoints if IV Furosemide is given by Bolus (Rapid Administration) or Infusion (Slow Administration) |
| Clinical Use | Monitor Weight (to assess response to Drugs, as Diuretics cause a reduction in Body Water Content) and renal function (via Creatinine to assess GFR and to assess adverse effects on Na⁺ and K⁺ Homeostasis) |

### Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

- These are antagonists to the Aldosterone Receptor in the CCD
- This increases Na⁺ Excretion and K⁺ Retention

# ACE Inhibitors and **β-Blockers**

### **β-Blockers**

- When administering drugs like β-Blockers, ACEi and ARBs, A low dose is given initially and then this dose is slowly increased to the maximum tolerated dose to find the dosage at which side effects are minimal but the efficacy of the Drug is maximised

| Example | Bisoprolol, Carvedilol |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Block β1 and/or β2-AR |
| Effect | Anti-Sympathomimetic (Blocks effects of increased SNS Outflow), Prevent Adverse Cardiac Remodelling |
| Side Effect | Bradycardia, Erectile Dysfunction, Peripheral Coldness, Bronchospasm |
| Indication | All NYHA Classes |
| Key Trials | Reduce all cause mortality by 33% vs Placebo |
| Clinical Use | Start at low dose and increase to maximal tolerated dose (Target HR = 60 BPM) |

### ACE Inhibitors

- These prevent the conversion of AT1 into AT2
- First Dose Hypotension = Sudden and Pronounced Hypotension that occurs when going from Lying Down to Standing the first time that a drug is administered

| Example | Ramipril, Lisinopril, Enalapril, Captopril |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Inhibit Angiotensin II Production which Reduces Aldosterone Release, Decreasing Na⁺/H₂O Retention |
| Effect | Anti-Hypertensive (Via Vasodilation and Reduced ECV), Prevent Adverse Cardiac Remodelling |
| Side Effect | Cough, Hyperkalaemia (Due to reduced Aldosterone Release), Renal Impairment, First Dose Hypotension |
| Indication | All NYHA |
| Key Trials | Reduce all cause mortality by around 25% vs Placebo |
| Clinical Use | Start at Low Dose and Increase to Maximal Tolerated Dose, Monitor Renal Function for Adverse Effects |

---

# Angiotensin Receptor Blockers

- These prevent the effects of Angiotensin I on the Angiotensin Receptor (Primarily to prevent Aldosterone Release and Cardiac Remodelling)
- This is primarily given to Px who cannot tolerate ACEi due to the development of a Severe Cough - In this case, they are Prescribed an ARB instead
- They work identically to ACEi (Same Side Effects, Indications etc.) except they do not produce a Cough as they do not disrupt Bradykinin Metabolism

| Example | Losartan, Candesartan, Valsartan |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Inhibit AT2 Activity, preventing Aldosterone Release which Decreases Na⁺/H₂O Retention |
| Effect | Anti-Hypertensive, Prevent Adverse Cardiac Remodelling |
| Side Effect | Hyperkalaemia, Renal Impairment, First Dose Hypotension (NO COUGH) |
| Indication | All NHYA Classes if ACEi is not tolerated |
| Key Trials | Reduces Cardiovascular Mortality and Hospital Admission by 25% vs Placebo |
| Clinical Use | Start at Low Dose and Increase to Maximal Tolerated Dose, Monitor Renal Function for Adverse Effects |

---

# Vasodilators

- These are rarely used in the Management of Heart Failure
- These are primarily used to reduce TPR, to reduce BP and hence, Afterload, preventing a reduction in CO that would exacerbate HF due to SNS and RAAS Activation

| Example | Nitrates (Isosorbide Mononitrate etc.), Hydralazine |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Vasodilators |
| Effect | Reduce Preload and Afterload via Venous and Arterial Vasodilation respectively |
| Side Effect | Hypotension and Headache |
| Indication | All NHYA Classes, If ACEi or ARB are not tolerated |
| Key Trials | Reduced Mortality, Particularly in African Americans |
| Clinical Use | Nitrates Develop Tolerance (Become less effective with continued use) as with continuous use, there is reduced Receptor Expression, producing a weaker effect |

---

# Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists

| Example | Spironolactone, Eplerenone |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Decrease Na⁺ and H₂O Retention by Blocking the Activity of Aldosterone |
| Effect | Increased Diuresis and Prevent Adverse Cardiac Remodelling |
| Side Effect | Hyperkalaemia, Renal Impairment and Gynaecomastia |
| Indication | NYHA Class II-IV |
| Key Trials | Reduce Cardiovascular Mortality or Hospital Admission by around 33% |
| Clinical Use | Start at Low Dose and Titrate Up. Monitor Renal Function |

---

# Sacubitril Valsartan and Digoxin

### Sacubitril Valsartan

| Example | Sacubitril Valsartan |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Combination of Neprilysin Inhibitor (Sacubitril) with ARB (Valsartan) |
| Effect | Counteracts Vasoconstriction, Na⁺ Retention and Maladaptive  Cardiac Remodelling |
| Side Effect | Hyponatraemia and Renal Impairment |
| Indication | NYHA II-IV after given β-Blocker, ACEi/ARB and Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist |
| Key Trials | Reduced All Cause Mortality by 15-20% Compared to Enalapril alone |
| Clinical Use | Start at low dose and Titrate up/Increase Dosage slowly to reach Maximal Tolerated Dose. Monitor Renal Function |

### Digoxin

- Digoxin Increases CO by increasing SV (Positive Inotropy), Reduces Preload and Reduces SNS Outflow by increasing PSNS Outflow
- Digoxin has a very low Therapeutic Index (Similar Toxic and Therapeutic Doses), so it is important to monitor Plasma Digoxin Levels to prevent the drug accumulating to Toxic Levels

| Example | Digoxin (Cardiac Glycoside) |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanism | Positive Inotropic Effect, Reduces Preload and Inhibits SNS |
| Effect | Antiarrhythmic |
| Side Effect | Visual Disturbances and Arrhythmias (Notably Bradycardia) |
| Indication | NYHA II-IV in Px after given β-Blocker, ACEi/ARB and Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist and Sacubitril Losartan |
| Key Trials | No Mortality benefit but reduced Hospital Admissions |
| Clinical Use | Target Serum Levels Post Dose should be 0.5-1 ng/mL. Routine Drug Level Monitoring is not required once a stable/ideal dosage has been established |

---

# Devices

- Cardiac resynchronization (CRT-P) devices improve symptoms in patients with QRS >120 ms (Broad QRS) by stabilising/regularising the Heart Rhythm
- Implantable defibrillators (ICD) improve mortality in patients with a high risk of sudden cardiac death, regardless of QRS duration, by defibrillating the heart if it goes into VTach or VFib

# Drugs That Have No Effect In Heart Failure Management

### No Benefit

1. Anti-Thrombotic - Routine anticoagulation (e.g. warfarin) or antiplatelet (e.g. aspirin) therapy does not improve symptoms or prognosis for Px who do not have existing need for them (E.g Ischaemic Heart Disease, Arrhythmias AFib etc.)
2. Statins: e.g. Atorvastatin; no benefit in patients without hypercholesterolaemia or ischaemic heart disease

### Potentially Harmful

1. Non-dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers: e.g. Verapamil,
Diltiazem. Potentially harmful due to negative inotropic action which decrease CO, leading to increased SNS and RAAS activation
2. NSAIDs: e.g. Ibuprofen; can worsen the symptoms of heart failure by promoting salt and water retention, increasing ECV and hence, Preload and Cardiac Work
