# [UMP2004] Pharmacology of the Sympathetic Nervous System II

# Adrenoceptors Receptor Subtype

- 9 Subtypes, characterised by Selective Antagonists:
1. α1A, α1B and α1D
2. α2A, α2B and α2C
3. β1, β2 and β3
- Additional α1 and α2 subtypes are significant as subtype selective antagonists can be more easily developed and may have fewer side effects

---

# α-Adrenergic Antagonists

### Competitive Irreversible

- Non Selective α1 and α2 = Phenoyxybenzamine
- Competitive Irreversible antagonist that alkylates receptors
- First α blocker used clinically but not well tolerated as it also binds to non-Adrenoceptors alongside α receptors
- Correct dosage is harder to determine for irreversible blockers in order to provide sufficient but not complete α adrenoceptor blocking

### Competitive Reversible

- Non-Selective α1 and α2 = Phentolamine
- Selective α1 = Prazo**sin**, Doxazosin and Tamsulosin
- Selective α2 = Yohimine, Idazoxan and Atipamezole

---

# Therapeutic Uses of α-Adrenoceptor Antagonists

### Therapeutic Uses of α1 Antagonists

1. Hypertension
2. Phaeochromocytoma 
3. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)
- Phaeochromocytoma = Tumour of Chromaffin Cells in Adrenal Medulla, causing high Adrenaline Release, leading to Hypertension (α1-mediated Vasoconstriction). Hence, Antagonism of α1 prevents Vasoconstriction, preventing associated Hypertension

### Therapeutic Uses of α2 Antagonists

- May contribute to antidepressant activity of Mirtazapine as it is thought that Depression could be caused by low levels of NA and 5-HT Release in the brain
- Therefore, blocking Presynaptic α2-ARs could increase NA Release
- Release of NA from SNS Motor Neurons stimulate α1 AR on Arterioles, causing Vasoconstriction and increasing BP (Increased SNS Activity increases BP)
- α1-Antagonists block the action of NA on Arteriolar α1-AR, preventing NA-Mediated Vasoconstriction and hence, preventing subsequent Hypertension
- E.g Prazosin historically but more commonly, Doxazosin is used
- Selective α1 Antagonists are more effective than Non-Selective α Antagonists (Like Phentolamine) as Non-Selective α Antagonists would also block Presynaptic α2-AR, increasing NA Release, which would subsequently increase α1-AR Stimulation, Vasoconstriction and hence, BP (Opposes α1 effect)

### Consequences of α1-AR Blockade

1. Fall in BP
2. Postural Hypotension
- When Px stands up, Gravity causes blood to pool in Venous System, causing BP to drop.
- This stimulates Baroreceptor Reflex to increase BP back to normal levels by increasing SNS Stimulation of Arterioles to produce α1-Mediated Vasoconstriction.
- Therefore, α1 Antagonists block the increased SNS Drive to Arterioles due to the Baroreceptor Reflex, preventing this compensatory vasoconstriction, leading to Postural Hypotension
1. Nasal Stuffiness
- α1 Antagonist causes Vasodilation in the nose, increasing blood flow and hence, swelling within the Nasal Mucosa, hence leading to stuffiness
- α1 Agonists are used to treat a Blocked/Stuffy Nose
1. Failure of Ejaculation
- Ejaculation is mediated by α1 receptor stimulation due to NA from the SNS and hence, can be blocked with the use of α Antagonists
1. Miosis
- Stimulation of α1-AR on the Radial Smooth Muscle of the iris lead to Muscle Contraction, dilating the pupil (narrowing Iris) to make the Pupil Larger (Mydriasis)
- α1 Antagonists block this contraction of the Iris Radial Smooth Muscle, causing Overconstriction of the Iris, leading to Miosis (Pupil Constricts)

### Adrenaline Reversal via α1-AR Blockers

- Low Dose of A causes reduced TPR and BP due to β2-AR mediated Vasodilation
- High Dose of A causes BP to increase due to α1-AR Mediated Vasoconstriction, leading to a Decrease in HR due to activation of the Baroreceotor Reflex
- Phentolamine/α1-AR Antagonists cause a Decrease in BP and a Reflex increase in HR due to the Baroreceptor Reflex
- When a Px is given an α-AR Antagonist, followed by a High Dose of A, A can no longer stimulate α-AR, only β-AR
- This causes a Reversal of effects, leading to a drop in BP (β2-AR Mediated Vasodilation) and small Reflex rise in HR due to the Baroreceptor Reflex

![Screenshot 2021-10-19 at 12.47.32.png](%5BUMP2004%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20the%20Sympathetic%20Nervous%20%20eb2f052ff9914e6d96bbb2c83c868f31/Screenshot_2021-10-19_at_12.47.32.png)

### Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)

- Non-Cancerous enlargement of the Prostate Gland, increasing in Incidence with age
- As the Urethra passes through/pierces the Prostate Gland, this enlargement pressed on and narrows the Urethra, reducing the passage of Urine down the Urethra, making it harder to urinate
- Stimulation of α1-AR on the Smooth Muscle Capsule of the Prostate leads to Contraction, further narrowing/compressing the Urethra
- α1-AR Antagonists (E.g Doxazosin) block this α1-Mediated Constriction of Smooth Muscle, allowing the Smooth Muscle Capsule of the Prostate to Relax
- This reduces compression of the Urethra, increasing Urinary Flow

![Screenshot 2021-10-19 at 12.47.52.png](%5BUMP2004%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20the%20Sympathetic%20Nervous%20%20eb2f052ff9914e6d96bbb2c83c868f31/Screenshot_2021-10-19_at_12.47.52.png)

- Prozasin and Doxazosin are non-selective for Cloned α1 subtypes (α1a, α1b and α1c)
- Notably, Prazosin has a low affinity for the α1a subtype expressed on Prostatic Smooth Muscle, causing increased stimulation of other α1 subtypes, producing pronounced Hypotension and little relaxation of Prostatic Muscle
- Tamsulosin has a high affinity for Prostatic α1a-AR and hence, produces less stimulation of other α1 subtypes expressed on Arterioles, having a much weaker hypotensive effect at a given dose but causing significant prostatic relaxation

# Adrenoceptor Antagonists and Hyperlipidaemia

- α1-AR Antagonists like Doxazosin may reduce Blood TAG levels whilst increasing HDL and Decreasing LDL Levels
- It therefore may be beneficial in Coronary Artery Disease that is associated with Hypertension and Hyperlipidaemia due to its Hypotensive and Hypolipidaemic effects
- It is unknown how α1-AR Antagonists produce these effects but they may increase LPL Activity, which reduces TAG levels

---

# Pre-Synaptic Inhibition of Adrenergic Transmission

- Drugs can decrease transmitter release by inhibiting:

1) Transmitter Synthesis

2) Inhibiting Storage and Release of Transmitter

### Inhibition of Synthesis

- Conversion of Tyrosine to L-DOPA by Tyrosine Hydroxylase is the rate-limiting step in Catecholamine Synthesis

### α-methyltyrosine/Metriosine

- α-methytyrosine/metriosine binds to Tyrosine Hydroxylase and acts as an competitive inhibitor, reducing Catecholamine Synthesis
- Can be used to Rx Phaeochromocytoma to reduce NA and A Production by Malignant Chromaffin Cells
- α-methyldopa is converted to α-methyldopamine by Dopa-decarboxylase
- α-methyldopamine is then converted into α-methylNA, which is stored and released from SNS Nerve Terminals, having a low affinity for α1-AR
- α-methylNA causes decreased α1 stimulation on Arterioles, decreasing α1-Mediated Vasoconstriction to lower BP
- It also is a selective α2 agonist, stimulating presynaptic α2-AR to reduce Peripheral Adrenergic Transmission
- α-methyldopa can also cross the Blood Brain Barrier and can act on α2-AR in the Medulla Oblongata to reduce SNS Outflow from the Vasomotor Centre
- These Central and Peripheral effects of α-methyltyrosine means that it lowers BP and can be used as an Antihypertensive

### Disulfiram

- Used to Rx Alcoholism by inhibiting Aldehyde Dehydrogenase
- It also inhibits Dopamine-β-Hydroxylase to inhibit the conversion of DA to NA within Vesicles
- This reduces NA production and increases DA production

![Screenshot 2021-10-19 at 13.05.19.png](%5BUMP2004%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20the%20Sympathetic%20Nervous%20%20eb2f052ff9914e6d96bbb2c83c868f31/Screenshot_2021-10-19_at_13.05.19.png)

### Reserpine

- Indole Alkaloid which irreversibly inhibits VMAT₂.
- Reserptine is reuptaken into the presynaptic nerve terminal via Uptake 1 Mechanism (using NET), where it blocks VMAT₂ on the Vesicle Membrane to reduce NA Entry into the Vesicle and Hence Vesicular [NA]
- This causes reduced NA released and reduced postsynaptic AR stimulation
- NA that is not uptaken into vesicles (due to VMAT₂ inhibition) is metabolised my MOA/Monoamine Oxidase although there can be an initial accumulation of NA in the Cytosol of the Nerve Terminal, which can leak out to produce initial AR Stimulator Effects, followed by Prolonged inhibitory effects
- As 5-HT and DA are monoamines, VMAT₂ is also responsible for the uptake of these into their vesicles
- This means Reserpine also inhibits 5-HT and DA release from Neurons
- Has been used as an Antihypertensive (Reduced NA release) and antipsychotic (reduced DA release) however, due to its broad central effects of reducing Monoamine Release (NA, DA and 5-HT), it can be associated with Side effects of Depression and Parkinson-Like Syndrome and hence, is rarely used nowadays

# β-Adrenoceptor Antagonists

- Non Selective β1 and β2 Antagonist = Propanolol (First AR Antagonist developed with β Selectivity)
- Propanolol has relatively high β1 and β2 affinity but low β3 affinity
- Selective β1 Antagonists = Atenolol, Bisoprolol and Metoprolol

### β-AR Antagonists with Intrinsic Sympathomimetic Activity (ISA)

- Pindolol, Timolol and Oxprenolol
- These act as β Antagonists at lower [ ] and at Higher [ ], they can stimulate β-AR and act as agonists
- Sometimes considered Partial Agonist but as the effect of these drugs is [ ] dependent, they are not classic partial agonists
- Partial Agonist effect was initially considered to be a potential beneficial effect of these drugs but now, this is considered to be a negative effect of their activity

### Vasodilating β-Blockers

### Combined α/β1 Antagonist Properties

- These have combined α/β1-AR Antagonist properties and block α1 mediated vasoconstriction of Arterioles
- E.g Carvedilol and Labetatol
- Some non-selective β blockers can cause peripheral vasoconstriction by blocking β2-Mediated Vasodilation on some blood vessels

### β1 Antagonist and β3 Agonist

- E.g Nebivolol
- Produces vasodilation by β3 Stimulation on Vascular Endothelial Cells and Cardiomyocytes of the Myocardium, causing NO release and vasodilation

---

# Therapeutic Uses of β-Adrenoceptor Antagonists

### Cardiovascular

- Selective β1 Blockers are used to treat a range of CVD and are better than Non-Selective β Blockers as they do not cause Bronchoconstriction or Peripheral Vasoconstriction mediated by blocking β2 Stimulation in Bronchi and Blood Vessels
- In Congestive Heart Failure, β1 Antagonist protects it from the damaging effects of Over phosphorylation of Cardiac Proteins by increased and prolonged SNS Stimulation
- In Angina, β1 blockers have a Negative Chronotropic and Inotropic Effect, Reducing Cardiac Work and O₂ consumption/metabolic demand of the Cardiac Muscle
- In Hypertension, the Negative Chronotropic and Inotropic Effects reduce CO, reducing BP and act centrally to reduce SNS Outflow from the Medulla, reducing α1-Mediated Vasoconstriction due to SNS activity that causes Hypertension
- They improve survival after Myocardial Functions and reduce the incidence of Arrhythmias mediated by SNS Overactivity

### Other Uses

1. Thyrotoxicosis - Increased levels of Thyroid Hormone leads to increased SNS Activity, leading to Tachycardia
- The effects of Increased SNS Activity can therefore be blocked by blocking β1-AR in the heart
1. Anxiety - Increased SNS Activity and β-AR Stimulation in Anxiety leads to Sx like Trembling
- Whilst β-Blockers can block the symptoms mediated by increased SNS Activity and β-AR Stimulation, they do not impact the psychological effects of anxiety (only some physical activities)
1. Can be used for Prophylaxis of Migraines via an unknown mechanism
2. Glaucoma - β2-AR on the Ciliary Body stimulate Aqueous Humour production. Therefore, Non-Selective β Blockers (E.g Timolol) will inhibit Aqueous Humour Production, reducing IOP

---

# Solubility and Metabolism

- Differences in Lipid and Water Solubility of β-Blockers can affect their Pharmacokinetics and Clinical Effects
- E.g Propanolol is Lipid Soluble whereas Atenolol is Water Soluble
- Lipid Soluble β Blockers are metabolised in the liver and have a short half life whereas Water Soluble β Blockers are excreted by the kidneys and have a longer half-life
- Lipid Soluble Antagonists may have more CNS/Central side effects as they can cross the Blood Brain Barrier whilst Water Soluble Antagonists cannot
- This means that Lipid Soluble Antagonists may also be more effective for treating CNS-Associated conditions like Anxiety and Migraine

---

# Contraindications and Side Effects of β-Adrenoceptor Antagonists

### Contraindications

1. Asthma - May Exacerbate Bronchoconstriction (already present in Asthma) by blocking β2-AR that produce Bronchodilation
2. Peripheral Vascular Disease - Can cause further vasoconstriction of blood vessels by blocking β2-AR Mediated Vasodilation (expressed on Vascular Smooth Muscle)
3. AV Block
4. Diabetes
- These effects are reduced by the usage of β-Selective Antagonists (and are usually produced by the use of Non-Selective β-Blockers)

### Side Effects

1. Fatigue and Bradycardia - Due to Blocking of β1-Mediated Positive Inotropy and Chronotropy
2. Cold Extremeties - Due to blocking of β2-Mediated Vasodilation on Peripheral Blood Vessels
3. Hypoglycaemia - Due to blocking of β2-AR in the Liver, which reduces Hepatic Glucose Output into the Blood
4. CNS Side Effects (Sleep Disturbances and Nightmares)

### Type I Diabetes

- β-AR Blockers may exacerbate Hypoglycaemia in Insulin Dependent/Type 1 Diabetes
- This is by blocking β2-Mediated Glucose Release from the Liver into the Blood
- β Blockers may also mask the signs of Hypoglycaemia, by blocking SNS Responses to Hypoglycaemia, delaying appropriate homeostatic responses

### Type II Diabetes

- May increase the risk of Insulin Resistance, and hence, the development of Type II Diabetes
- The mechanism of this is unclear but it is known that Non-Selective, Non-Vasodilating β Antagonists may reduce Skeletal Muscle Blood Flow (By Blocking β2 Mediated Vasodilation) and hence, reduce Insulin Dependent Glucose Uptake by the Muscle (Due to reduced Glucose and Insulin Delivery to the Muscle, meaning increased Insulin levels are needed to maintain normal Glucose uptake by muscles)
- Vasodilating β Blockers (Carvedilol and Nebivolol) provide better Glycaemic Control than Non-Selective β Blockers as they do not impact Skeletal Muscle Blood flow and hence, do not impact Insulin Dependent Glucose Uptake
- β1 Selective Blockers (Atenolol and Metoprolol) are linked to Hyperglycaemia and Insulin resistance (likely as their selectivity for β1 over β2 is dubious/highly debated)

### Hyperlipidaemia

- β Blockers may increase Blood TAG Levels and Decrease HDL
- However, Carvedilol may reduce Blood TAG levels as it also Blocks α1-AR, which reduces Circulating TAG levels

---

# β-Adrenoceptor Antagonists as Inverse Agonists

- Despite all β1-Blockers having the same β1 blocking effect, some have better efficacy than others, potentially due to the ability of some β-blockers as Inverse Agonists
- Some β-ARs display some spontaneous activity/stimulation and hence, display a base rate of activity
- Metaprolol has shown to be a very good inverse agonist on β-ARs
- Inverse Agonists differ from Antagonists as whilst Antagonist just block the activity of the Agonist on the Receptor, Inverse Agonists suppress spontaneous receptor signalling, producing the opposite effect to the Agonist
- These Inverse Agonists can reduce [cAMP] and Cardiac Contractility to below basal/unstimulated levels, to produce a pronounced reduction in Cardiac Work and Metabolic/O₂ Demand

# β-Adrenoceptor Antagonists  and GRK/Arrestin Mediated Effects

- β1 and β2-AR are Gs linked and stimulate Adenylyl Cyclase to increase cAMP production
- When the β1/β2-AR has been stimulated by an Agonist, it can be phosphorylated by GRK at GRK Phosphorylation sites (G Protein Receptor Kinase), allowing for β arrestin adaptor proteins to bind to the receptor
- This causes:
1. Desensitisation of the receptor to stimulating the Gs-cAMP pathway upon Agonist binding
2. Internalisation of the receptor
3. Activation of other Kinase Pathways with longer effects on the wider cell (E.g ERK 1/2 or Extracellular Signal Related Kinases)
- β3 contains no GRK Phosphorylation sites and hence, becomes much less desensitised/internalised after stimulation

![Screenshot 2021-10-19 at 18.11.09.png](%5BUMP2004%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20the%20Sympathetic%20Nervous%20%20eb2f052ff9914e6d96bbb2c83c868f31/Screenshot_2021-10-19_at_18.11.09.png)

- Some β-Blockers are Biased Agonists for the GRK/Arrestin Pathway (in the absence of the Agonist) despite also antagonising the Gs Pathway of the β1 and β2-AR (when the Agonist is present)
- E.g Carvedilol and Nebivolol
- They can stimulate the GRK Phosphorylation of β1 and β2 Adrenoceptors to promote Arrestin and ERK1/2 kinase Activity
- The effects of the Arrestin/ERK pathway on the wider cell may be cardio-protective

---

# Adrenergic Nerve Terminal - Previous Years Content from Here on

1. Arrival of AP to the Nerve Terminal causes the fusion of NA Vesicles with the Presynaptic Membrane
2. This releases NA into the Synaptic Cleft via Exocytosis, where it can stimulate Postsynaptic ARs
3. Stimulation of Postsynaptic ARs is terminated by reuptake of NA into the Nerve Terminal via Uptake 1 (Using NA Transporter)
4. When in the Nerve Terminal, some of the NA is broken down by MAO, expressed on the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane
5. NA is also taken up into Vesicles via VMAT2 (Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2)
6. Some NA is taken up across the postsynaptic Membrane into non-neuronal cells via Uptake 2 via OCT3 for Smooth Muscle (Organic Cation Transporter 3)
7. Inside the Non-Neuronal/Postsynaptic Cell, NA is metabolised by COMT (Catechol-O-Methyltransferase)

![Screenshot 2021-10-19 at 18.44.24.png](%5BUMP2004%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20the%20Sympathetic%20Nervous%20%20eb2f052ff9914e6d96bbb2c83c868f31/Screenshot_2021-10-19_at_18.44.24.png)

# Indirectly Acting Sympathomimetic Amines

- E.g Tyramine, Ephedrine and Amphetamine
- Tyramine is found naturally in fermented foods (Cheese and wine)
- These do not bind to and stimulate Postsynaptic ARs but increase NA release, leading to increased AR stimulation
1. These resemble the structure of NA so they are transported into Nerve Terminals via Uptake 1
2. Inside the Nerve Terminal, they are taken up into the Vesicles by VMAT in exchange for NA, which escapes into the Cytosol
3. Some of the cytoplasmic NA is degraded by MAO, but the high Cytosolic [NA] stimulates the efflux of NA out of the nerve terminal via Uptake 1 Reverse Transport, to act on postsynaptic ARs
- Exocytosis is not involved in this process, so the actions of Indirectly Acting Sympathomimetic Amines do not required an AP or the presence of Ca²⁺

![Screenshot 2021-10-19 at 19.35.58.png](%5BUMP2004%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20the%20Sympathetic%20Nervous%20%20eb2f052ff9914e6d96bbb2c83c868f31/Screenshot_2021-10-19_at_19.35.58.png)

# Inhibition of Pre-Synaptic Processes at Adrenergic Synapses to Increase Stimulation

- An increase in transmitter release by the Nerve Terminal is increased by the inhibition of:
1. Presynaptic Transmitter Reuptake
2. NA Metabolism

### Uptake Blockers

- E.g Cocaine, Tricyclic Antidepressants (Imipramine) and Reboxetine
- Cocaine blocks the reuptake of NA and DA
- Uptake Blockers bind to the NA Transporter mediating Uptake 1 of NA back into the Nerve Terminal, preventing NA Reuptake
- This causes NA to remain in the Synaptic Cleft, increasing the duration and intensity of the stimulation of postsynaptic (and potentially presynaptic) ARs

![Screenshot 2021-10-19 at 19.42.58.png](%5BUMP2004%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20the%20Sympathetic%20Nervous%20%20eb2f052ff9914e6d96bbb2c83c868f31/Screenshot_2021-10-19_at_19.42.58.png)

# MAO Inhibitors

- 2 Isozymes of MAO, which metabolise Monoamines in the Presynaptic Nerve Terminal
1. MAO-A - Selectively metabolises NA, DA and 5-HT
2. MAO-B - Selective metabolises DA and Tyramine
- These inhibit Monoamine metabolism within the Nerve Terminal, causing an increase in Presynaptic [Monoamine] and hence, increased release of these transmitters
- Monoamines like Tyramine are not normally absorbed in the Gut as they are digested by MAO expressed in the Gut
- Non-Selective Inhibitors like Phenelzine can cause the 'Cheese Reaction' by blocking both MAO-A and MAO-B in the Gut
- This means that Monoamines like Tyramine are not broken down in the gut, allowing it to be absorbed
- This causes the Cheese Reaction, where Tyramine stimulates the release of NA from SNS Nerve Terminals on Arterioles, causing α1-Mediated Vasoconstriction of Arterioles and subsequent Hypertension
- MAO-A Selective Inhibitors like Moclobemide do not block Tyramine metabolism by MAO-B and hence, do not cause the Cheese Reaction
- MAO-Inhibitors are used as Antidepressants as depression is thought to involve low levels of NA or 5-HT in the CNS so raising levels of these Monoamine Levels produces an antidepressant effect
