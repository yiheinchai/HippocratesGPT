mathematical interpretation of data (what body does to the drug).
- **A**bsorption → Uptake of Drug from Site of Administration into the Plasma
- **D**istribution → Reversible distribution of drug from the Plasma into the various body fluid compartments
- **M**etabolism (Biotransformation)
- **E**xcretion → Via Urine, Bile or Faeces
- Metabolism + Excretion = Methods of Drug Elimination

# Drug Regime

### Benzylpenicillin

- 1.2 g daily in 4 divided doses.
- Intramuscular (small doses) or slow intravenous injection or infusion.

### Fluphenazine Decoanoate (Anti-Schizophrenic)

- Deep intramuscular injection into gluteal muscle (12.5 mg initially).
- After 4-7 days, 12.5-100 mg, repeated at intervals of 14-35 days, adjusted according to response.
- Dosing Regimes vary from drug to drug, varying in dose, administration frequency and site of administration to ensure there is a sufficient [Drug] is present in the target site to produce therapeutic effects

# Chemical Modification to Alter Pharmacokinetics

### Ampicillin

- 4 carbon ring structure makes it very labile.
- Very sensitivity to acid. Not very hydrophobic because it has a carboxyl group.

### Pivampicillin

- Modified with an ester linkage via non-specific esterases.
- Higher concentration in plasma by using this prodrug which is then broken down to
ampicillin.

# Potential Fate For a Drug

- Liberation and Absorption occur simultaneously
- Liberation: release of Drug from tablet.
- Absorption: free drug in plasma can have different fates:
1. Bind to proteins.
2. Biotransformed by liver:
- Metabolites can then return to plasma to be excreted.
- Metabolites can return to tissues (E.g Accumulate within Adipose Tissue if Hydrophobic) or bind to unwanted sites.
1. Bind to receptor (to produce desired effect and side effects).
- Cannot measure concentration at receptor (impossible), but we can measure free concentration of drug in plasma.

# Plasma Concentration of Drugs

- Changes in drug concentration at a site of action in tissue will lag behind changes in plasma so that changes in plasma concentration proceed and are of a greater magnitude than those seen in the Tissue.
- [Blue curve] Shifted maximum and lower
amplitude. Lower concentration of drug at target site.

### Drug Concentration

- Pharmacokinetics is concerned with drug concentration in body.
- Ideally would like to know concentration at site of action.
- Usually it is not possible to do this.
- Pharmacokinetic studies measure plasma concentration (Cp).

---

# Absorption

### 1. Membrane Represent Drug Barriers

- Drugs have to cross at least 1 plasma membrane to reach their site of action.
- Exception: receptors expressed on the endothelial cells of blood vessels, where drugs within the blood come in direct contact with these receptors.

### Membrane Permeability of Drugs

- Paracellular transport: via gaps between cells. Water and small molecules (up to 200 kDa). Not traditional way drugs enter cells.
- Membrane pores: drugs similar to compounds that normally are able to enter pores. This is not the main way that drugs enter cells as they are usually too large to pass through these pores.
- Pinocytosis: property of some cells to allow the uptake of larger molecules. Taken up with a vesicle into cell. If receptor is on inside of organelle, will then have to cross the plasma membrane of the vesicle to act within cell.
- Active transport: normally very specific, using energy gradient to move drug against concentration gradient. Molecules binding to transporter have to be similar to existing molecules that utilise active transport mechanism.
- Membrane lipid (Passive Diffusion): easiest and main way for drugs to enter as it is non-saturable and shows low structural specificity. If drug is too hydrophilic, will stay outside. If too hydrophobic, will stay inside cell.
- Membrane Carriers: Some carriers bind the drug, and undergo a conformational change to allow passive movement of a drug down its energy gradient

### 3. Lipid Solubility

- Lipid solubility of a drug is commonly measured by its partition coefficient (P) between an organic solvent (heptane, CHCl₃, or octanol) and water.
- Partition coefficient: how much drug will remain in organic phase.
- Bigger P value means more drug in organic phase.
- P = [ ] in Organic Phase / [ ] in Aqueous Phase
- Many studies demonstrate a positive correlation between lipid solubility and rate of absorption from site of administration.
- More hydrophobic drug is, better it is absorbed.
- Making aliphatic chain in secobarbitol longer than barbitol makes it more
hydrophobic, so it is more easily absorbed.

# 4. Drug Ionisation

- Most drugs are either weak acids or weak bases and hence, will ionise to some extent in solution
- Consider a weak acid: HA **⇌** H⁺ + A⁻
- Drug ionisation therefore depends on:
1. pKa of Drug
2. pH of solution in which drug is being dissolved.
- 𝑝𝐻 = 𝑝𝐾𝑎 + log [𝐴−]/[𝐻𝐴]
- 𝑝𝐻 = 𝑝𝐾𝑎 + log [𝐼𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑑 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚]/[𝑈𝑛𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑑 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚]
- Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: 𝑝𝐻 − 𝑝𝐾𝑎 = log [𝐴−]/[𝐻𝐴]
- Remember: when 𝑝𝐻 = 𝑝𝐾𝑎, left hand side of Henderson-Hasselbach equation is 0. As a consequence, [𝐴−]/[𝐻𝐴] = 1 (both are at same concentration), which means 50% of drug is ionised. This is
obviously case for acid and base.

---

# 5. Ion Trapping

- Absorption of a drug of pKa 4.4 (weak acid) into plasma.
- At pH 1.4 (gastric juice), equilibrium for weak acid lies on undissociated side (as there are lots of protons).
- As it is hydrophobic is its non-ionised form, it can then cross lipid bilayer to enter the Intracellular Fluid.
- Intracellular pH is now 7.4 (fewer protons), so molecule dissociates here. -ve anion (drug) is hydrophilic and therefore trapped on plasma side.
- Without using energy, the ionised form of the drug accumulates within the cell, causing, allowing it to increase in [ ] to up to x 1000
- Energy is initially used to establish proton gradient, but that is another process not directly involved with ion-trapping itself.

# 6. pKa Values for Drugs

- As pKa increases, the strength of the base increases and the strength of the Acid decreases

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 19.10.13.png](%5BUMP2037%5D%20Pharmacology%20-%20Absorption%20and%20Distributi%2076b3f863dc9a4587877b9da10c772fe5/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_19.10.13.png)

# Routes of Administration

### Enteral

- Via GI tract
- This is the safest, most common and cheapest form of drug administration
- Oral: taken by mouth
- Sublingual: placed under tongue (some swallowed therefore enteral)
- Rectal: inserted into rectum.
- These methods are convenient and there is no requirement for sterility

### Parenteral

- Not via GI tract → This is used for drugs that are not stable in the GIT, if Px is unable to take oral medications (E.g Unconscious) or if rapid Onset is required
- Intravenous: injected into vein
- Intramuscular: injected into muscle
- Sublingual: placed under tongue (absorption into vessels found directly under tongue)
- Subcutaneous: injected beneath skin
- Ocular route: instilled into eye
- Nasal: sprayed into nose and absorbed via nasal membranes
- Inhalation: breathed into lungs, usually through mouth
- Cutaneous: applied to skin
- Transdermal: delivered through skin by patch

---

# Benefits of Specific Routes of Administration

### Enteral Administration

- To avoid first pass metabolism within the Liver, give sublingually or rectally.
- Drugs that are absorbed via the GIT experience enter the portal circulation, where they are transported to the Liver for First Pass Metabolism (Reduces Drug Bioavailability) before they enter the general circulation

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 19.13.54.png](%5BUMP2037%5D%20Pharmacology%20-%20Absorption%20and%20Distributi%2076b3f863dc9a4587877b9da10c772fe5/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_19.13.54.png)

### Sublingual/Buccal

- Avoids first pass metabolism.
- Example: glyceryl trinitrate in angina.

### Rectal

- Avoids first pass metabolism and destruction via Gastric Acid.
- Useful with younger children (not done in UK).
- Useful for some irritants.
- Useful when patients unable to take and retain drugs (vomiting, unconscious).
- Administration as suppositories.

# Oral Administration

- Lipid solubility and ionisation: weak acids may be absorbed from stomach but weak bases are absorbed less effectively.
- Surface area available for absorption: villi and microvilli favour absorption from intestine (200 m²), increasing absorption rate across the intestines.
- Weak acids are better absorbed by intestine (although pH is less favourable compared to stomach, because of surface area).
- Pathological changes in intestinal villi: surgery and disease (coeliac) may ↓ surface area and ↓ rate of absorption.

**Role of Gut Motility:**

- Peristalsis provides mixing and hence dissolution of drug and its presentation to mucosa.
- Rapid Gastric emptying moves drug into intestine where absorption will be faster.
- Metoclopramide: ↑ gastric emptying (↑ aspirin absorption).
- Retention in stomach ↓ absorption.
- Propantheline: ↓ intestine motility (↓ aspirin absorption).
- Motility and gastric emptying is affected by diet and drug action.
- Diarrhoea may pass drug through gut too rapidly through the GIT to allow much absorption.

**Effect of Drug Contents on Absorption:**

- Bulk effect (where there is lots of material in the stomach) ↓ drug concentration (full stomach) and impairs physical access of drug to the mucosa where it can be absorbed.
- Chemical interaction can and impair drug uptake:
- E.g Antacids and Milk impair absorption of tetracycline, phenytoin, rifampicin as Calcium and Aluminium ions form complexes with these ions, preventing absorption.
- Splanchnic blood flow (blood flow around stomach): Generally not rate limiting but ↑ after meals and ↓ in shock and haemorrhage.
- Formulation: how tablet has been put together.
- Bioavailability ↓ moving to right (suspension, capsule, tablet, coated tablet) as coated tablet needs to be dissolved first to release the active drug.
- For a tablet, important considerations are:
1. Disintegration time: how long the tablet it takes to break down into uniform particles.
2. Rate of dissolution → Rate it takes for particles to dissolve and release the active drug: influenced by particle size and crystal form.

---

# Effect of Particle Size on Oral Absorption

- 250 𝜇𝑚 particle is well absorbed.
- 75 𝜇m particle is more readily absorbed.
- Therefore, as particle size decreases, the drug is more readily absorbed into the circulation
- Adding a certain detergent, ↑ absorption further.

---

# Formulation of a Tablet

- Outer coating: physical robustness/storage (alter the rate and location of drug release), colour/labelling, sweetener.
- Active ingredient of a tablet is often a very small component

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 19.18.31.png](%5BUMP2037%5D%20Pharmacology%20-%20Absorption%20and%20Distributi%2076b3f863dc9a4587877b9da10c772fe5/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_19.18.31.png)

# Bioavailability and Bioequivalence

- Bioavailability = Measurement of rate and extent of a therapeutically active drug that reaches systemic circulation.
- Between the Drug reaching the Systemic Concentration, the amount of drug that passes through unmetabolised is gradually reduced
- Dose → Destroyed in Stomach (by Acid or Enzyme → Drug Not Absorbed across Intestines → Destroyed by the Gut Wall (Acid or Enzyme Degredation) → Destroyed by the Liver (First Pass Metabolism) → Systemic Circulation

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 19.19.03.png](%5BUMP2037%5D%20Pharmacology%20-%20Absorption%20and%20Distributi%2076b3f863dc9a4587877b9da10c772fe5/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_19.19.03.png)

### Bioavailability and Bioequivalence

- According to European regulations, 2 medicinal products are bioequivalent if they are pharmaceutically equivalent or
pharmaceutical alternatives and if their bioavailabilities after administration in same molar doses are similar to such a degree that their effects, with respect to both efficacy and safety, will be
same.
- Bioequivalence: essentially whether 2 drugs are same or not.
- Bioavailability: fraction of an administered dose that reaches systemic circulation.

### Oral Bioavailability

- Bioavailability can be quantified by measuring area under curve of
plotting plasma concentration against
time.
- [Graph] Pink and orange lines are not bioequivalent as amount of drug and peaks are different.
- This could result in toxic side effects (pink) or no effects (orange).
- Blue and yellow lines are considered relatively bioequivalent.

# Injection

- Intravascular: intravenous (i.v.) or intraarterial (i.a.).
- Most direct, common and fastest routes of administration (100% bioavailability).
- Skill is required when administering these.
- When administered as a Bolus, a large quantity of drug is rapidly introduced into the circulation (High Peak [ ] but shorter lasting in the circulation) and if administered via Infusion, the drug is introduced into the circulation at a slower rate, over a longer period of time, causing a lower peak [ ] but longer persistence of drug in the circulation
- Intramuscular (i.m.): still quite rapid effects and simpler compared to i.v. and i.a.
- Depots:
- Drug is often suspended in a Non-Aqueous Vehicle. As the Vehicle diffuses out of the muscle, the drug precipitates at the site of injection and dissolves slowly to provide a sustained dose over an extended period of time
1. Procaine-benzylpenicillin: local anaesthetic with antibiotic.
2. Phenothiazines (e.g. fluphenazine decanoate): anti-schizophrenic.
3. Haloperidol
- Subcutaneous (s.c.): absorption occurs via simple diffusion and can be ↓ by added vasoconstrictor (local anaesthetic).
- E.g Insulin and Heparin

---

# Absorption from Lung

- The lung has a Large surface area, rich blood supply, thin membranes, meaning there is rapid absorption of drugs across the lungs into the blood stream.
- Drugs absorbed here produce systemic actions: gaseous anaesthetics, nicotine, solvents.
- It can also produce local actions on the lungs: bronchodilators and other drugs for asthma.
- Administration of solid or liquid aerosols: controls of droplet/particle size, metering of dose can be difficult however as a substantial fraction will be swallowed.
- [Graph] Probability that inhaled droplets of different diameter will deposit in different regions of respiratory
tract.
- The Bigger the particle is, further out it
remains (it will deposit in larger structures within the respiratory tract).
- Only small particles can pass through the smaller airways and reach the alveoli to be absorbed here.

---

# Transdermal Absorption

- Skin is generally considered a barrier, but some drugs with a high lipid solubility can penetrate through the skin.
- This is primarily used for the sustained, low level delivery of drugs
- Skin patches: glyceryl trinitrate, nicotine, fentanyl.
- Toxicity can occur via the absorption of toxic compounds across the skin:
1. Phenol: organic compound.
2. Aniline: basis of dye for dyeing jeans.
3. Organophosphorus anticholinesterases: chemical weapon.

---

# Topical Administration to Eye

- Rate and extent of absorption determined by time drug remains in cul-de-sac (where the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva meet in the lower eyelid) and precorneal tear film.
- Eye drops: small % of drug enters eye.
- Ocular Inserts are drug-impregnated delivery device that are placed in the Cul-De-Sac and release Medicine slowly.
- Ocuserts are used to administer Pilocarpine to treat Glaucoma
- Suspensions
- Ointments
