# [UMP2027] Pharmacological Basis for The Treatment of Epilepsy

# Epilepsy

- Repeated occurrence of sudden excessive or synchronous discharges in cerebral cortical neurons resulting in a disruption of consciousness, disturbance of sensation, movements, impairment of mental function, or some combination of these.
- Epileptic seizure: a seizure resulting from epileptic (excessive and/or hypersynchronous), usually self-limited, activity of neurons in brain.
- Epileptic disorder: chronic neurological condition characterised by recurrent epileptic seizures.
- Seizure: sudden, short event involving a change in a person’s awareness of where they are or what they are doing, their behaviour or their feelings. May be of varied origin.
- Convulsion: lay term. One form of physical manifestation of a seizure, involving episodes of excessive, abnormal muscle contractions, usually bilateral, which may be sustained or
interrupted.

### Statistics

- More than 450,000 people in UK have epilepsy (1 per 131).
- Worldwide, around 50 million people have epilepsy.
- 1 person in 50 will develop epilepsy at some time in their life.
- 1 in 20 will have a single epileptic seizure.
- Around 70% could 9achieve full seizure control through medication.
- NHS spent > £310 m on prescriptions for AEDs in 2019.

# Aetiology

- Epilepsy is classified as symptomatic or idiopathic.
- Symptomatic: indicates that a probable cause exists.
1. Cerebrovascular lesions
2. Perinatal or postnatal trauma.
3. CNS infections
4. Tumours
5. Congenital malformations of CNS.
- Idiopathic: indicates that no obvious cause can be found.
- Usually no other neurological condition.
- Genetic factors probably responsible.

# Classification/Types of Epilepsy

- Epilepsy is not 1 condition, but a diverse group of disorders (around 40 types of recognised types).
- This diversity reflects:
1. Numerous underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.
2. Different spatial and temporal characteristics of seizures based on where and when different regions of the brain are active.

### Why are Epilepsies Classified?

- Classification provides information on Aetiology, appropriate Rx and Prognosis
- Classification based on symptoms and electroencephalogram (EEG).

### Classification of Seizure Origin

- Partial: begins with a local electrical discharge in 1 area of brain.
- Primary generalised: begins with a widespread electrical discharge that involves both sides of brain at once.

### Partial/Focal Seizures

- Partial Seizures can be divided into Simple Partial Seizures and Complex Partial Seizures where Consciousness is preserved and altered during the Seizure respectively
- Always start with just 1 hemisphere of brain.
- May involve a small area or all of a hemisphere, with Sx (Motor or Sensory) reflecting the affected region of the Brain
- May progress to secondary generalised seizure.

### Simple Partial Seizure (Consciousness Preserved)

- Only a small part of brain is affected.
- Person remains conscious, and may know they are having a seizure.
- May involve motor cortex: twitching of 1 contralateral limb or part of a limb.
- May involve sensory cortex: an unusual smell, taste or feeling (e.g. pins and needles).
- May develop into other seizures, so terms ‘warnings’ or ‘auras’

### Complex Partial Seizure (Consciousness Altered)

- Person’s consciousness is affected, so they may be confused.
- Can involve automatic movements (spontaneous automatisms).
- Fiddling with clothes or objects.
- Mumbling or making chewing movements.
- Wandering about.
- May have little or no memory of seizure.
- Often occurs in temporal lobes (temporal lobe epilepsy).

### Secondary Generalised Seizure (Unconscious)

- Partial seizures spread, to involve both hemispheres of brain.
- Person becomes unconscious.
- May not be aware that their seizure began as a partial seizure.

### Primary Generalised Seizure (Unconscious)

- Both hemispheres from onset.
- May have little warning of onset of Seizure.
- Involve loss of consciousness.
- These can be grouped into Tonic, Atonic, Myotonic, Tonic-Clonic and Absence Seizures - here
- Tonic seizure: sustained ↑ in muscle contraction.
- Atonic seizure: sudden loss of muscle tone.
- Myoclonic seizure: sudden involuntary muscle contraction.
- Tonic-clonic seizure: sequence of tonic and clonic phases.
- Absence seizure: brief interruption of consciousness and perception of the environment (involves thalamo-cortical circuits).
- Most seizures are limited in duration.
- Prolonged or clustered seizures may develop into non-stop seizures (status epilepticus).
- Seizures follow 1 another with no intervening periods of normal neurologic function.
- Requires hospital treatment to bring seizures under control.
- Generalised convulsive status epilepticus may be fatal

---

# Electoencephalogram (EEG)

- Recording of electrical activity of cerebral cortex, usually through
electrodes placed on scalp.
- Measures electrical potentials of cortical neuronal dendrites near brain’s surface.
- Seizures are often noted on ECGs with high frequency wave forms
- Ictus: a sudden event (such as a seizure).
- Interictal spike: a brief EEG spike occurring between seizure activity.
- When taking depth EEGs via electrodes inserted into the Brain, Seizures are usually identified by gradually increasing amplitude waveforms

### Paroxysmal Depolarising Shift

- Paroxysmal depolarising shift (PDS) is a cellular marker of epileptic event (Cellular equivalent of Interictal Spike).
- This is most clearly seen on Intracellular recordings from the activity of a single neuron involved in the seizure as a large magnitude positive deflection
- This is characterised by long lasting, suprathreshold depolarisation due to entry of Na⁺ and Ca²⁺
- Ca²⁺ entry produces K⁺ channel opening, with K⁺ efflux producing a prolonged after-hyperpolarisation (Where Vm is far below threshold) which serves to terminate PDS to prevent subsequent, high frequency neuronal activation which would cause a seizure.
- Failure of Ca²⁺ dependent K⁺ current which underpins the afterhypolarisation appears crucial for transition from interictal spike to seizure.

# Epileptogenesis (Normal → PDS)

- This is the gradual process by which a normal brain develops epilepsy.
- PDS causes a burst of action potentials in cell.
- This propagates hyperexcitability to surrounding tissue to produce larger areas of synchronised activity to produce a seizure.
1. Changes in intrinsic properties: tCa²⁺, tNap⁺, ↓ K⁺ channel activity can promote bursting.
2. Changes in synaptic efficacy: increased tEPSPs (excessive activations of NMDARs) or ↓ IPSPSs due to loss of GABA mediated inhibition.
3. Changes in synaptic connectivity: changes in circuitry promoted by loss of normal input due to the formation of additional neuronal connections, allowing for recurrent excitation (e.g. Hippocampal sclerosis). 
- Stimulating 1 neurone may stimulate many neurones.

---

# Mutations in Idiopathic Epilepsy

- Gain of function of Na⁺ would create a strong depolarisation.
- Loss of function of K⁺ and Cl⁻ would ↓ hyperpolarisation, therefore maintaining stimulated state.

### Voltage-Gated Ion Channels

| Channel | Gene | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Na⁺ | SCN1A, SCN2A and SCN1B | GoF - Impaired Inactivation, causing prolonged Activation and hence, Na⁺ influx |
| Ca²⁺ | KCNA1, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 | LoF |
| Cl⁻ | CLCN2 | LoF |

### Ligand Gated Ion Channels

| Channel | Gene | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GABA-A Nicotinic | GABRA1 and GABRG2 | Reduction in Function - Greater desensitisation or failed insertion into the membrane, both of which reduce GABAergic Signalling |
| ACh | CHRNA4, CHRNB2 | GoF - Prolonged Opening, causing greater excitation |

---

# Anti-Epileptic Drugs

- Aim is to dampen neuronal hyperexcitability that leads to or sustains an epileptic attack.
- Work by:
1. ↓ excitation:
- ↓ activity of voltage-gated Na⁺ and/or Ca²⁺ channels.
- ↓ efficacy of excitatory synapses.
1. ↑ inhibition:
- ↑ efficacy of inhibitory synapses.
- ↑ K⁺ channel activity.
- Effects is generally antiseizure rather than antiepileptogenic as they prevent neuronal hyperexcitability (which causes Seizures) rather than treating the underlying cause of the Seizures (Epilepsy).

### Long-Established Anti-Epileptic Drugs

| Class | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Hydantoins | Phenytoin |
| Dibenzapines | Carbamazepine |
| Succinimides | Ethosuximide |
| Barbiturates | Phenobarbiton |
| Benzodiazepines | Diazepam |
| Fatty Acid | Sodium Valproate |

---

# Drugs that Reduce Excitation

### Reduced Activity of Na⁺ Channels

- Voltage and use dependent inhibition of Na⁺ channels.
1. Phenytoin
2. Carbemazepine
3. Valproate
- Use-dependent blockade (due to ability to preferentially bind to Na⁺ channels in inactivated state AKA neurones firing at a high rate) allows these drugs to block high-frequency discharge that occurs in hyperexcitable cells during a seizure without unduly interfering with low-frequency firing of neurones in normal state.

### Reduced Activity of Voltage-Gated Ca²⁺ Channels

- Inhibition of T-type Ca²⁺ channels
- Ethosuximide (Also blocks Na⁺ channels)
- Low-threshold (T-type) Ca²⁺ channels in thalamic neurones enable burst pattern of firing and are important in generation of normal thalamocortical rhythms within their loops.
- They are involved in genesis of abnormal spike-wave discharges that characterise absence epilepsy (petit mal) (brief loss and return of consciousness).
- Gabapentin and Pregabalin also inhibit α2δ auxillary subunit-containing P/Q Type Ca²⁺ channels

---

# Drugs that Increase Inhibition

### Blocking GABA Metabolism

- Valproate
- An inhibitor of GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), the enzyme responsible for breakdown of GABA within Neuron and Glial Cells.
- This leads to an ↑ amount of GABA in brain.
- Build up intracellular causes GABA transporter to work in opposite direction (Reverse Transport), so GABA leaves cell instead of being re-uptaken.
- It also blocks Na⁺ channels.

### Potentiation of GABA-A Action

- ↑ postsynaptic efficacy of GABA by allosteric modulation of GABA-A
receptors.
- Shifts dose-response curve to left, so GABA more potent at receptor.
1. Benzodiazepines: diazepam, clonazepam
2. Barbiturates: phenobarbitone may also directly ↑ Cl⁻ flux in the absence of GABA.

### Activation of K⁺ Channels

- Retigabine
- This is a Positive modulator of KCNQ2-KCNQ5 (Kv7.2–Kv7.5) Potassium
channels that mediate the M-type voltage-dependent potassium current in
neurons to promote hyperpolarisation and increase neuronal inhibition.

---

# Newer AEDs

1. Lamotrigine
2. Levetiractam
3. Retigabine
4. Gabapentin
5. Vigabatrin
6. Pregabalin
7. Topiramate
8. Oxcarbazepine
9. Lacosamide
10. Tiagabine
11. Perampanel
12. Cannabidiol
13. Fudinamide
14. Felbamate
15. Zonisamide
- Newer AEDs are recommended for those:
1. Who have not benefitted from treatment with older drugs such as carbamazepine or sodium valproate.
2. For whom older AEDs are unsuitable because:
- These are contraindications to drugs.
- Person is a woman of childbearing potential.
- Could interact with other drugs (oral contraceptives).
- Known to be poorly tolerated.

---

# Mechanism of Action of Newer AEDs

### Inhibition of Na⁺ Channels

- Voltage and use dependent inhibition of Na⁺ channels modifies activity of hyperexcitable cells without affecting normal activity.
- This means that whilst an initial Spike can be seen in the activity of Hyperexcitable Neurons, prolonged depolarisation/spiking activity is blocked due to the Use-Dependent Nature of Their activity (Block Highly Active Neurons)
1. Lamotrigine
2. Topiramate
3. Rufinamide
4. Zonisamide
5. Lacosamide

### Blockade of Excitatory Transmission

1. Blockade of NMDA-type glutamate receptors.
- Felbamate: Antagonist at the glycine site on NMDA receptors to prevent its activation and hence, reducing excitation.
- Aplastic anaemia and hepatotoxicity are common side effects, so not used in humans frequently but is sometimes used (E.g in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome).
1. Antagonists of postsynaptic AMPA-type glutamate receptors.
- Perampanel: non-competitive antagonist of AMPA receptor.
1. ↓ of glutamate release.
- Levetiracetam: binds to SV2A (vesicular protein), enhancing synaptic depression of Glutamatergic Transmission that occurs with repeated activity of the Glutamatergic Neuron (↓ glutamate release).

### Inhibition of GABA Uptake

- Tiagabine: selective inhibitor of GAT-1 (GABA transporter), which usually mediates GABA Reuptake into Neurons and Glia
- Increasing the spread and duration of action of GABA can be achieved by inhibition of membrane transporters, normally responsible for GABA uptake.
- Prolong time that GABA remains in synaptic cleft, therefore able to diffuse and activate other GABA-A receptors for a prolonged period of time, increasing GABAergic Inhibition.

---

# Ketogenic Diet

- Established treatment option for children with hard to control epilepsy.
- When the body breaks down fat to produce energy – rather than using glucose from carbohydrates – chemicals called ketones are created (hence ‘ketogenic’).
- The medium-chain triglyeride (MCT) ketogenic diet uses a fat supplement (MCT oil) to increase ketogenesis.
- One fatty acid component of the oil – decanoic acid – has anti-seizure actions alone, and has been shown to be a non-competitive AMPAR antagonist to reduce excitation.

---

# Choice of Drugs

- Dictated by type of seizure and efficacy but also tolerability.
- AEDs are associated with idiosyncratic and dose-related side effects.
- These may be particularly important with long-term use and hence, may be poorly tolerated due to side effects persisting for long periods of time.
- The ‘newer’ AEDs are used for those who have not benefited from treatment with established drugs or for whom the older AEDs are unsuitable because:
1. There are contraindications to the drugs
2. The patient is a woman of childbearing potential as they are known to be teratogenic
3. Older drugs could interact with other drugs (oral contraceptives)
4. Older Drugs are known to be poorly tolerated
- Monitoring of plasma concentration may be important.

### Side Effects

- Induction of Liver Enzymes is common due to their effects on the metabolism of other drugs and hence, interactions/contraindications with drugs like Oral Contraceptives

![Screenshot 2022-01-19 at 00.43.57.png](%5BUMP2027%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20The%20Treatment%20%20312d2a4ec26449ceb9dccf076cbc234e/Screenshot_2022-01-19_at_00.43.57.png)

### Monitoring

- Monitoring of Plasma Concentration of Antiepileptic Drugs may be important for drugs like Phenytoin
- Phenytoin is eliminated through hepatic metabolism by a cytochrome P450 system.
- Enzymes in this system shows saturation or zero-order kinetics, so plasma half-life (20 hours) ↑ with dose.
- So phenytoin usually given as a single dose and plasma level monitored to prevent toxicity due to Phenytoin accumulation

### Seizure Type

| Class | Drugs |
| --- | --- |
| Focal | First Line = Carbamezapine and Lamotrigine. Alternatives = Oxcarbazepine, Valproate, Levetiracetam and Zonisamide |
| Generalised Tonic-Clonic | First Line = Valproate. Alternatives = Lamotrigine (Carbamazepine and Oxcarbazepine) |
| Generalised Absence | First Line = Ethosuximide and Valproate. Alternative = Lamotrigine |
| Status Epileptics | First Line = Lorazepam. Alternative = Diazepam (Phenytoin) |

### Choice of Drugs - Metabolism

- Some Antiepileptic Drugs can lead to:
1. Induction of microsomal enzymes responsible for drug metabolism - Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Carbamazepine
- This can lead to:
1. Changes in oral anticoagulant metabolism
2. Changes in oral contraceptive metabolism – possibly leading to unplanned pregnancy

### Toxicity

- Birth defects and problems with learning and development have been associated with the use of AEDs in Pregnant Women
- All established AEDs show some teratogenicity
- Major congenital malformations may occur in 4-10% of Px – a 2- to 4-fold increase on the normal rate seen in the general population
- There is Particular concern over valproate In women of childbearing potential
- In these Px, lamotrigine is used instead to minimise risk of Teratogenicity
