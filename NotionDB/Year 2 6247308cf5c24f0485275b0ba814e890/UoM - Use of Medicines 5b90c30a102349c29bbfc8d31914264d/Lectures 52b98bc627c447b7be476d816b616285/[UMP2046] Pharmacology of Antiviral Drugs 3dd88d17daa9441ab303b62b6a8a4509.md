# [UMP2046] Pharmacology of Antiviral Drugs

# Theory of Chemotherapy and Problems

- Find qualitative (preferable) or quantitative biochemical
difference between host and parasite which when exploited by a
selective drug, results in a cytotoxic effect to parasite but not host.
- Whilst Bacteria/protozoa have many differences to host cells which can be targetted pharmacologically, Viruses have fewer differences to host cells as they hijack hosts biochemistry in order to replicate and hence, viral synthesis is closely linked to human cellular functioning.

# Diverse Viral Genomes and Viral Life Cycle

### Diverse Viral Genome

| Types of DNA/RNA | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Linear dsDNA | Herpes, adenovirus, poxvirus |
| Circular dsDNA | Papovavirus |
| ssDNA | Parvovirus |
| dsDNA (Minor Group) | Reovirus |
| ssRNA | Poliovirus, rubella, influenza, RSV, hepatitis, HIV |
- There might be viral nuclei acid modifications processes in these viruses that are not present in Human Nucleic Acid Synthesis that can act as potential sites for drug action

### Viral Life Cycle

1. Attachment and entry: through micropinocytosis or more usually,
specific host cell receptors to invoke endocytosis.
2. Viral nucleic acid replication: viruses completely take over control
fo host cell‚Äôs protein synthesis machinery to synthesise viral nucleic acid.
- RNA virus (+): poliovirus.
- RNA virus (-): influenza virus.
- Retrovirus (RNA or DNA): HIV
- DNA virus: HSV
- For DNA Viruses, transcription of the Viral Genome occurs to produce mRNA encoding the Viral DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerase which can replicate the viral genome
- For RNA Viruses, RNA must provide its own RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase via a Positive Sense/Coding Strand that is directly translated by the Host Ribosomes or a Negative Sense/Template Strand where a viral RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase must be preformed within the Virus so that once the Virus has infected the host cell, the RNA Polymerase can synthesise positive sense mRNA from the Template which can then be translated
- For Retroviruses, Reverse Transcriptase is found preformed within the Virus to Reverse Transcribe RNA into DNA, which can then be transcribed and translated using Host Protein Synthesis Machinery
- For some viruses (Retroviruses), the Viral Genome enters the Nucleus of the Host Cell where it integrates into the Host Genome, where it is replicated, before leaving the Genome to be translated to synthesise viral proteins whilst for other viruses, their Genome is directly translated following replication to synthesise viral proteins
1. Production and processing of viral proteins and coat assembly of
virions.
2. Viral release and shedding (egress).

# Therapeutic Strategies

1. Inhibition of attachment onto, or penetration into cell.
2. Inhibition of reverse transcriptase activity (RNA viruses).
3. Inhibition of viral integrase
4. Inhibition of viral proteases.
5. Inhibition of viral DNA polymerase.
6. Inhibition of protein translocation and assembly of viral proteins to form the Viral Capsid.
7. Inhibition of viral shedding.

### Problems

- Intracellular viral replication using metabolic machinery of host
so there is risk of collateral damage to the host cell.
- Infection is not detected until late in virus‚Äô time course/replication stages, meaning it is quite difficult to target the earlier steps of viral replication.
- Rapid viral evolution due to high error rate of Viral Polymerases, meaning Viruses can rapidly accumulate mutations during replication prevent Antivirals from acting on its drug target within the virus to render these drugs ineffective as viruses become resistant.

---

# Inhibition of Attachment Onto or Penetration Into the Cell

- Most effective anti-virus strategy is to prevent entry of virus into cell:
- Vaccines prepared against attenuated forms of a virus (viral coat proteins) provide this protection but this is not possible to do for all viruses.
- Total pooled ùõæ-globulins (collection of all the Antiviral Ab produced during an immune response against the virus) provide prophylaxis and some attenuation of established infection: hepatitis A; measles virus; rabies virus.
- Antibodies against viral proteins can attach to these proteins to block receptor-mediated interaction and hence, viral entry into host cell.
- Target host-cell surface receptors of viruses: e.g. CD4 (HIV); AchR (rabies); IL2-R (leukaemia); HLA (adenovirus); compliment C3d receptor (glandular fever), ùõΩ-adrenoceptor (infantile diarrhoea) and ACE2 (COVID-19).

### Virus Incorportation (Amantadine and Rimantadine)

- Mechanism of Action - Influenza virus binds to sialic acid on cell surface of respiratory epithelial cells before it is endocytosed.
- Within acidic phagosome, virus M2 channel on viral envelope causes H‚Å∫ to enter and cause acidification of viral lumen, which allows virus to uncoat so that it can release its nucleic acid so that it can be replicated.
- Amantadine and Rimantadine are basic drugs that can permeate into the Lysosome, where they block the M2 protein to prevent acidification of the lysosome and thus prevent uncoating whilst also being able to neutralise acid in lysosome itself due to their basic nature.
- Amantadine can also be used as an NMDA-R Channel Blocker
- Amantadine and Rimantadine have been shown to be effective against Influenza A and sometimes, Herpes Zoster Virus (Shingles) and Rubella and hence, are only used in those where infection with these viruses can cause significant illness

# Inhibition of Reverse Transcriptase Activity (RNA Viruses)

### HIV Viral Replication Cycle

1. HIV enters host cells by gp41 and gp120 binding to CD4 and CCR5 on Macrophages respectively, with this binding causing a conformational change of the receptors to allow for viral entry
2. Once inside the cell, the Nucleic Acid is released into the Cytosol, where Preformed Reverse Transcriptase (RNA Dependent DNA Polymerase not normally found in the host cell) from the HIV synthesises cDNA from the Viral RNA that can be inserted into the Genome
- As Reverse Transcriptase is an Enzyme unique to HIV that is not found in the Host Cell, it can be used as a drug target with minimal impacts on Host Cellular Functioning and hence, produces minimal toxicity
- The Majority of Antivirals are Virustatic Antimetabolites that prevent Nucleic Acid Synthesis by having a much higher affinity for Viral Enzymes than Host Cell Enzymes so that they are selective for viruses over Host Cells to minimise collateral damage and toxicity

### Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors

- Nucleic Acid Synthesis occurs via the Extension of Nucleotide Polymers that form DNA via the formation of Phosphodiester Bonds between adjacent Nucleotides in the 5‚Äô‚Üí3‚Äô Direction
- Nucleosides = Base + Sugar
- Nucleotides = Base + Sugar + Phosphate
- Therefore, this process can be inhibited by:
1. Competitive Inhibition of Polymerases that are responsible for extending and hence, replicating the viral genome (Viral Nucleic Acid Synthesis)
2. Termination of the Nucleic Acid Chain via the Addition of a Nucleotide Analogue that lacks a 3‚ÄôOH and hence, cannot form a Phosphodiester Bond with the 5‚Äô Phosphate Group of an Adjacent Nucleotide
- Phosphate on nucleotides make them -ve molecules, so they
cannot enter cell. Therefore, Nucleoside vs Nucleotide Prodrug analogues are used as their lack of phosphate makes them neutral, allowing them to diffuse into cells, where they can then be phosphorylated to bioactivate them to form the active antiviral.
- Once within a cell, Nucleoside Analogues can be phosphorylated by kinases to form
nucleotides.
- Nucleoside RT inhibitors possess a different group rather than
‚àíOH on 3‚Äô end, so once incorporated, they cause premature
chain termination.
- It is the conversion of Virustatic Antimetabolites that are Nucleosides into Nucleotides that allows for the Bioactivation of the Prodrug Antiviral to form the Active Antiviral

**Examples:**

- These all contain different chemical groups attached to the 3‚ÄôC instead of an -OH to prevent Chain Extension via the formation of a Phosphodiester Bond between the Analogue and another nucleotide whilst also by directly inhibiting Reverse Transcriptase in their Triphosphate/Nucleotide Forms
- Azidothymidine (AZT, zidovudine): thymidine analogue,
possessing an 3‚Äô azide group instead of -OH.
- Dideoxycytidine (DdC, zalcitidine): cytidine analogue, replacing
‚àíOH with ‚àíH.
- 3‚Äô-Thiocytidine (3TC, lamivudine): analogue of cytidine, replacing
3‚Äô ‚àíOH with sulfur.
- Dideoxyinosine (Ddl, didanosine): adenosine analogue, replacing
3‚Äô ‚àíOH with ‚àíH.

### Azidothymidine/AZT Mechanism of Action

- After entry into the Cell, The AZT Prodrug is phosphorylated 3 times to AZT-MP, AZT-DP and then AZT-TP (Active Drug) by Host Cellular Kinases
- AZT-TP then selectively inhibits Viral Reverse Transcriptase (much more significantly than its inhibiton of Host DNA Polymerase)
- In Addition, when incorporated into the Growing DNA Strand, the lack of 3‚ÄôOH in AZT (as there is an Azide Group instead) means that no Phosphodiester Bond and hence, Chain Extension can occur, preventing DNA Synthesis from occurring

### Field Efficacy of RT Inhibitors

- After a few days: maximal drug efficacy, causing a prompt and significant fall in HIV-1 RNA load, which persists for around a month.
- Weeks: Viral Load slightly increases to higher levels, indepedent of the acquisition of resistance by the HIV Viruses but rather due to reduced efficacy of the RT Inhibitor.
- Months: slow increase in Viral Load occurs, most likely due to ‚Üë resistance of HIV Reverse Transcriptase to the RT Inhibitor.
- Rebound of Viral Load to baseline viral load seen pre-treatment occurs after discontinuation of treatment as inhibition of cDNA Synthesis and hence, HIV Viral Replication is removed.

### Resistance to RT Inhibitors and Suppression of Resistance

- Experience suggests that targeting multiple different molecular targets is best way to combine drugs to prevent resistance.
- However, this is not case for RT inhibitors.
- Nucleoside RT inhibitors do not have cross-resistance to multiple different drugs that target the same molecular target, so resistance
is developed against 1 particular NRTI rather than all NRTIs due to mutation accumulation within the HIV Virus.
- Therefore, resistance to a specific NRTI can be suppressed by simply using another NRTI that also acts on Reverse Transcriptase.

### Hepatitis B and Reverse Transcriptase

- Although hepatitis B is a DNA virus, it uses a RNA proviral
intermediate that has to be copied back to DNA via Reverse Transcriptase for replication, hence its reliance on reverse transcriptase.
- Lamivudine (3TC): inhibits viral reverse transcriptase in Hepatitis B to prevent the formation of Viral DNA from the RNA Proviral Intermediate.
- Viral DNA Polymerase is inhibited by using Phosphonate Analogues of dAMP (Adefovir) and dGMP (Entecavir) which are modified Nucleotide Analogues
- As they are relatively neutral (as instead of a Phosphate, which is -vely charged, they have a phosphate analogue which is less negatively charged), they can enter the cell in their Nucleotide Forms and once within the cell, they do not need to be phosphorylated by Cellular Kinases to become bioactive, allowing them to be directly incorporated into growing Viral DNA Chain, inhibiting Viral DNA Polymerase
- Famciclovir can also be used in the Rx of HBV

---

# Nucleotide Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors

- These are Phosphonate Derivatives
- Tenofovir: Used to treat chronic hepatitis B and HIV. Indicated to
be used for PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) in HIV alongside Emtricitabine.
- Adefovir: used to treat hepatitis B.
- Resistance against Adefovir develops more slowly than resistance against Lamivudine
- Both are delivered as conjugated pro-drugs.

---

# Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTIs)

- These act as allosteric inhibitors of RT.
- RT is comprised of a P51 and a P66 subunit, with the P66 subunit containing Finger Domains, Thumb Domains and a RNASE H Domain
- As RNA is being reverse transcribed by RT, it passes through the Cleft between the Finger and Thumb Domains (where Catalytic Aspatates are found that begin to synthesise cDNA from the RNA passing through the cleft) before exiting the enzyme between the Thumb and the RNASE H Domain (this domain degrades the RNA so that only cDNA leaves the enzyme)
- NNRTIs bind to the Cleft between the Finger and Thumb Domains to prevent RNA from passing through RT, preventing the Reverse Transcription of RNA to form cDNA
- E.g Nevirapine
- They are used to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS, specifically HIV-1.

---

# Inhibition of Viral Integrase

- Integrase is a virally encoded enzyme that is required for splicing and hence, insertion of viral cDNA into host genomic DNA to form the Provirus which can then be transcribed to synthesise viral proteins.
- Elvitegravir and Raltegravir bind to integrase and effects Mg¬≤‚Å∫
binding, which is required by enzyme for its action.

---

# Inhibition of Viral Proteases - HIV Protease (Aspartyl Protease) Inhibitors

- Viral Protease is required for the splicing of large fusion proteins produced by a single polycistronic mRNA molecule into individual, functional viral proteins.
- Viral RNA is polycistronic (can encode > 1 polypeptide separately
within same RNA molecule).
- Example: indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir. Vary mostly in their
pharmacokinetics, but mechanisms are largely same
- As Cellular Proteases are also found, Protease Inhibitors can display some antagonism at these proteases and hence, do not have extremely high specificity, resulting in some side effects associated with their usage

### HAART (Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy)

- To prevent the development of drug resistant HIV mutants, a combination of drugs is used to treat HIV (NRTI, NNRTI and Protease Inhibitor), which significantly reduce viral load and allow T Cell Count to remain high for a long period of time before reversion occurs, characterised by a rapid increase in viral load and a simultaneous rapid decrease in T Cell Count.
- However, there are still issues with toxicity, side effects
(lipodystrophy), complex dosing regime which can affect therapy complicant, cost associated with HAART and the fact that HAART does not eradicate the virus to completely resolve infection.
- There are still fears that resistant strains may arise in future.

# Inhibition of Viral DNA Polymerases

- Targets replicative cycle of dsDNA viruses (herpes simplex, VZV, CMV, adenovirus, papillomavirus).
- As both Viral and Cellular DNA Polymerases used here are DNA-Dependent DNA Polymerases, there can be issues regarding low selectivity of these Antivirals which can produce side effects

### First Nucleoside Analogues of HSV/VZV But Not EBV

- Idoxuridine and Vidarabine
- Idoxuridine complexes with Tetrahydrofolate to inhibit Thymidilate Synthase to prevent the synthesis of Nucleotides, which in turn inhibits DNA Polymerase
- These early drugs were quite toxic, insoluble and meant that they had to be administered in large doses to show therapeutic effects
- Vidarabine is much less toxic than Idoxuridine and is similar in activity to Acyclovir but can be rapidly inactivated by Adenosine Deaminase

### Acyclovir

**Mechanism of Action**

- Acyclovir is a nucleoside analogue that is highly selective for virus infected cells.
- It lacks the cyclic structure of the Ribose group seen in Nucleosides, meaning it lacks the 3‚ÄôOH and hence, produces chain termination
- Following entry into the cell, the 1st phosphorylation step of nucleoside phosphorylation (ACV ‚Üí ACV-P) is catalysed by thymidine kinase (virally encoded, meaning that bioactivation of Acyclovir is limited to virally infected cells where Viral Thymidine Kinase can be found).
- Host kinases can then complete remaining phosphorylative steps (ACV-P ‚Üí ACV-PP ‚Üí ACV-PPP).
- Once drug is phosphorylated, it becomes -ve charged, so it cannot
leave, leading to bioaccumulation of drug within infected cells.
- Like NRTIs, acyclovir selectively inhibits viral DNA polymerase over Host DNA Polymerase directly and indirectly by being incorporated into growing chain and causing Chain Termination due to the lack of 3‚ÄôOH on Acyclovir.
- Acyclovir is therefore a competitive inhibitor of guanosine at Viral DNA Polymerase.

**Uses**

- Treatment of herpes virus and VZV, but is not effective against CMV.

### Other DNA Polymerase Inhibitors

- Valaciclovir is a valine conjugated prodrug which can also be used to Rx HSV as well as other Nucleotide Analogues like Famciclovir and Penciclovir
- Ganciclovir and Valganciclovir (Prodrug with improved Pharmacokinetics are often used to Rx CMV which is commonly seen in Px with HIV
- Foscarnet is a diphosphate analogue (Analogue of Phosphodiester Moiety seen forming the Backbone of the DNA Strand) which also Inhibit DNA Polymerase
- Cidofovir is a Phosphonate Analogue of dCMP which can be used to Rx CMV
- Ribavirin: guanosine analogue used in life threatening respiratory syncytial viruses. It inhibits viral RNA polymerase and GTP-
dependent enzymes (affecting viral mRNA capping via a virus specific mechanism not seen in Eukaryotic Cells).

# Inhibition of Protein Translation and Assembly of Viruses - Inferferons

- Inhibition of Protein Translation and Assembly of Viruses is mainly provided by Interferons produced as part of the Normal Immune Response
- These are glycoproteins with cytokine, immunomodulating and
antiviral activities.
- ùõº and ùõΩ interferons are produced by most cells.
- ùõæ interferons are produced by T lymphocytes.
- Interferons have multiple targets:
1. Inhibition of viral entry by downregulating the expression of the Cellular Receptor that the virus uses to gain entry into the host cell to infect it
2. Alteration of viral protein synthesis: induction of a latent cellular RNAase (degrades viral mRNA); suspension of ribosome function by phosphorylation and inhibition of a key initiation factor (eIF2) to prevent translation of viral mRNA to form Viral Proteins.

**Uses:**

- IFN-ùú∂-2b: in chronic hepatitis (B or C (with ribavirin)), hairy cell leukaemia, AIDS related Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma and genital warts.
- IFN-ùú∑: herpes virus infections and MS.
- As Interferons are peptides, they are not orally active and rapidly degraded so must be administered IV

---

# Inhibition of Viral Shedding - Inhibition of Influenza Release/Budding From Host Cell

- Oseltamivir (Tamiflu)
- Zanamivir (Relenza)

**Mechanism of Action**

- To Allow for Influenza budding/release from the Host Cell, Haemaglutinin on the Surface of the Influenza Virion binds to Sialic Acid on the Inner Surface of the Host Cell Membrane
- Influenza enzyme neuraminidase removes sialic acid from glycoproteins on the target cell membrane to allow for viral release as otherwise, the binding of Viral Haemaglutinin to Cellular Sialic Acid prevents the budding of newly formed virus out of infected cell.
- Oseltamivir and Zanamivir are sialic acid analogues that binds to neuraminidase, meaning that haemagglutinin remains bound to sialic acid on cell surface to prevent Viral Budding/Release from the Host Cell to limit the spread of the viral infection within the Infected Px.
- Doesn‚Äôt help person infected with virus, merely prevents spread of virus.

---

# Newer Targets for Antiviral Action - HIV-1 Entry

- HIV contains 2 surface proteins, essential for virus entry (gp41 and
gp120).
- These bind to CD4 on T cells, as well as to co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4.
- This allows a fusion protein to be formed which undergoes a conformational change to bring the host cells and viral membranes together to allow for fusion and viral entry.
- Maraviroc: non-competitive CCR5 inhibitor (-ve allosteric modulator) to alter its conformation to prevent viral gp120 from binding to it, preventing viral entry into the cell.
- Enfuviritide: prevents the HIV and Host Cell Lipid Membranes from fusing following the binding of viral gp120 and gp41 to CD4 and CCR5 on the Macrophages, preventing viral entry

---

# Summary

- Remdesivir inhibits Nucleic Acid Synthesis by causing Chain Termination of the Developing Viral Nucleic Acid but also causes Viral RNA to become unstable and degrade - This has been used in the Rx of Ebola and recently, COVID-19
