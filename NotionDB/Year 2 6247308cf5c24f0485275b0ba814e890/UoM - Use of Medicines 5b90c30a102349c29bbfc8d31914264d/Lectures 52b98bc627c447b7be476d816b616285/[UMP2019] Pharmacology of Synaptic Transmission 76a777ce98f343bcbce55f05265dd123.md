# [UMP2019] Pharmacology of Synaptic Transmission

# Summary of Synaptic Transmission

1. Action potential propagation in presynaptic neuron, causing depolarisation of the nerve terminal.
2. Ca²⁺ entry into synaptic knob.
3. Release of neurotransmitter by exocytosis into the Synaptic Cleft.
4. Binding of neurotransmitter to postsynaptic receptor in the Synaptic Cleft.
5. Opening of specific ion channels in subsynaptic membrane to convey information from the Presynaptic to the Postsynaptic Membrane and modulate its action.

---

# Criteria for a Neurotransmitter and Neurotransmitter Lifecycle

1. Synthesised/present in the nerve terminal.
2. Stored in nerve terminal in secretory vesicles.
3. Release regulated by Ca²⁺ influx.
4. Have a Postsynaptic effect which can be mimicked by an exogenous ligand.
5. Regulation of Synaptic Transmission by Inactivation by specific mechanism: (catabolism within the synaptic cleft and reuptake).
- Catabolism is mainly seen in ACh synapses and for other neurotransmitters, its mainly reuptake into the Nerve Terminal or associated Glia
- Neurotransmitters do not have to possess all these properties but many do

# Classical and Non-Classical Neurotransmitters

- Classical Neurotransmitters = Those that fill the majority of the Traditional Criteria of Neurotransmitter Properties
- Non-Classical Neurotransmitters = Those that fill very little of the Traditional Criteria of Neurotransmitter Properties

### Classical Neurotransmitters

| --- | --- |
| Glutamate | DA |
| GABA | NA |
| Glycine | 5-HT (5-Hydroxytryptamine) |
|  | Histamine |
|  |  |

### Hetero-Oligomers of Amino Acids (Peptides)

- These are neuromodulators predominantly that also function as Neurotransmitters

| Opioid Peptides | Neurotrophins - Involved in Developmental Processes | Tachykinins - Involved in Pain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| β-Endorphin | NGF | Substance P |
| Methionine-Enkephalin | BDNF |  |
| Leucine-Enkephalin |  |  |

| --- | --- | --- |
| ATP - Usually a Cotransmitter that is broken down outside the Synapse | Endocannabinoids - These are produced on-demand (not packaged) postsynaptically from Arachidonic Acid and diffuse across the membrane (not via Exocytosis) to act as a Retrograde Neurotransmitter to modulate Presynaptic Function | NO |
| Adenosine - Neuromodulator formed by ATP Catalysis |  | CO |
|  |  | These are produced postsynaptically by Synthases and regulate Presynaptic function |

# Neuronal Specialisations and Ca²⁺ Channels

### Neuronal Specialisations

- Fast synaptic transmission: small synaptic vesicles (SSVs) (50 nm diameter) which appear clear/transparent under EM.
- These are synthesised in the Cell Body and Trans Golgi Network and transported down the Axon to the Nerve ending from where they are released and then recycled in the nerve terminal via endocytosis
- These are predominantly signal to Ionotropic receptors but their receptors also have a metabotropic component (Ionotropic Effects are responsible for most of the effects of this transmission)
- These predominantly contain GABA, Glutamate, Glycine and ACh
- Slow synaptic transmission: small dense-core vesicles (SDCVs) (50-200 nm) which appear opaque/translucent under EM
- These mainly contain Catecholamines, Indoleamines (5-HT etc.)
- Like Fast Synaptic Transmission, Neurotransmitters and Vesicles are synthesised in the Cell body and transported down the Axon to the Nerve Terminal
- Unlike Fast Synaptic Transmission, they are recycled via the transport of the Neurotransmitter to the cell body where the proteinaceous component of the vesicles are reformed

### Ca²⁺ Channels

- Neurones use N and P/Q type Ca²⁺ Channels for neurotransmitter release (Excitation-Secretion Coupling).
- The α1 subunit of the N and P/Q Type Ca²⁺ Channels forms the pore of the Channel but also coordinates aggregation of Synaptic Vesicles at the active zone via interactions with Vesicle Proteins via the γ, β, δ and α2
- N, P, R and T type Ca²⁺  channels are also found postsynaptically

# CNS Neurotransmitters and Neurotransmitter Receptors

### Neurotransmitters

- They are always agonists (as antagonists have no efficacies)
- Can produce fast or slow events depending on the postsynaptic receptor.
- Can be excitatory or inhibitory depending on the Ionotropic or Metabotropic Receptor being targeted.
- Determined by receptors

### Receptors

- Presynaptic Receptors alter Neurotransmitter Release whereas Postsynaptic receptors alter Neurotransmitter Activity
- Presynaptic Receptors can be classed as Autoreceptors and Heteroceptors which are receptors for Neurotransmitters released from the cell in which the receptors are found and those released from other nearby cells respectively
- They can produce Fast (ms) or slow (s to min) effects:
- **LIGCs**: fast neurotransmission. They are fast as the Ligand Binding and Ion Channel Activity are intrinsically coupled as the binding site and pore are found in the same Multimeric Receptor
- **GPCRs**: slow neuromodulation. They are slow as they involve G Proteins and an Adaptor, which activates enzymes and produces 2nd messengers, that activate downstream intracellular signalling pathways.
- Subtypes can result in mixed effects of neurotransmitters.
- LIGCs are Multimeric Proteins with complex subunits
- GPCRs contain a 7 Transmembrane Domain Polypeptide Complex, which are associated with Heterotrimeric G Proteins which in turn interact with Enzymes that produce secondary messengers
- Some of these downstream signalling pathways can regulate ionotropic receptors via Phosphorylation

# Neurotransmitter Ionotropic Effects

- Stimulatory: depolarisation of plasma membrane potential.
- Inhibitory: hyperpolarisation of plasma membrane potential.

---

# GPCR Effects

## Gα Signalling

- When the Ligand binds to the GPCR, the Gα Subunit is activated, exchanging GDP for GTP and dissociates from Gβγ
- Gα Subunits activate enzymes that produces Secondary Messengers that are involved in Downstream Signalling Pathways
- G(12,13)α activates Rho to produce Cytoskeletal Changes
- Cholera and Pertussis Toxin inhibit Gαs and Gαi

### Gαs/i

- Stimulates (Gαs) or inhibits (Gαi ) adenylate cyclase.
- This therefore ↑/↓ levels of cAMP.
- cAMP determines the activity of various ion channels and Protein Kinase A, which goes on to phosphorylate other proteins to alter their activity
- cAMP therefore considered second messenger and PKA a secondary effector.

### Gαq

- Stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) which catalyses cleavage of membrane-bound PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate) into second messengers IP3 (inositol (1,4,5) triphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol).
- IP3 acts on IP3 receptors on membrane of Endoplasmic Reticulum to cause Ca²⁺ release, while DAG diffuses along plasma membrane to activate protein kinase C (PKC).
- Many isoforms of PKC are also activated by ↑ Ca²⁺, both these pathways can also converge on each other to signal through same secondary

## Gβγ

- The above descriptions for Gαs/i and Gαq ignore the effects of/act independently to Gβγ signalling.
- Gβγ primarily stimulates various ion channels (G-protein-regulated
inwardly rectifying K⁺ channels (GIRKs)) and inhibit P/Q and N-type voltage-
gated Ca²⁺ channels to regulate/inhibit synaptic transmission via Hyperpolarisation and reduced Synaptic Release respectively.
- They also directly inhibit the Exocytotic Apparatus of the Presynaptic Membrane to further block neurotransmitter release

# Glutamate and Its Receptors

- Major excitatory transmitter in CNS.
- Most neurones respond to glutamate.
- Often found as a neurotransmitter in long pathways.
- It usually produces point to point transmission (short duration) but can stimulate Glutamatergic Metabotropic Receptors to produce long term effects.

### Receptors

- AMPA Ligand is used to define/distinguish the AMPA Glutamate Receptor
- This is a trimetric Ionotropic receptor that allows for Major Na⁺ and Minor Ca²⁺ Flow
- Kainate/Kainic Acid Ligand is used to define/distinguish the Kainate Glutamate Receptor
- This is a tetrameric Ionotropic receptor that permits Major Na⁺ and Minor Ca²⁺ influx
- NMDA Ligand is used to define/distinguish the NMDA Glutamate Receptor
- This is a tetrameric Ionotropic receptor that permits Major Ca²⁺ and Minor Na⁺ flow.
- Glutamate is the natural, endogenous ligand for these receptors
- Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors are coupled to Gq or Gi G Proteins
- Various types of Glutamate Receptors can be expressed on the Postsynaptic Membrane of a single neuron, where they can modulate the activity of the other Glutamate Receptors upon stimulation
- Kainate Glutamate Receptors can also act as Autoreceptors to regulate Synaptic Release
- NMDA Receptors only permit Ca²⁺ flow when the neuron has been previously depolarised (E.g by AMPA Receptors) as this removes the Mg²⁺ Block to allow Ca²⁺ to flow through the Channel

# Ionotropic Receptors

- Glutamate is agonist for NMDA receptors at the NR2B Subunit, but glycine is required as a co-agonist at the NR1 Subunit for it to work.
- Ketamine and MK801 are NMDA Receptor channel blockers (block the receptors when they are activated - Uncompetitive Anaesthetic).
- Mg²⁺ blocks NMDA receptor (this happens for most of time) until depolarisation occurs which removes this Mg²⁺ block.
- NMDA Receptors are used as a coincidence factor that detects previous information about the state of the Neuron before it is activated
- Long term potentiation - When the C Fibre is tetanised/depolarised before it generates an AP/Fires, activation of the C fibres causes a much greater response and hence, increases pain stimulation, because rapid stimulation of AMPA receptor due to previous stimulation releases the Mg²⁺ block on the NMDA Receptors.
- This mechanism of LTP allows for the neuron to 'remember' the previous tetanus that occurred and is a mechanism involved in learning and memory

---

# Glutamate Overstimulation and Excitotoxicity

- Over-stimulation of AMPA and NMDA Receptors by Glutamate leads to too much Ca²⁺ influx into the Neuron via NMDA, AMPA but also by Ca²⁺ Channels that open due to Membrane Depolarisation.
- This increases Intracellular [Ca²⁺] causing widespread and excessive activation of Ca²⁺-Stimulated Intracellular Pathways and Excessive NO production and causes water to osmose into the Neuron, causing it to swell
- Overproduction of NO causes derivatisation of Neuronal Proteins, both of which lead to Neuronal death

---

# Metabotropic Receptors

- mGLU-R1/5: Gq/11 ↑ PLC.
- mGLU-R2/3: Gi/o ↓ AC
- mGLU-R4,6,7,8: Gi/o ↓ AC
- mGLU-R2,3 and R4,6,7,8 are found presynaptically where they inhibit neurotransmitter release, preventing Excitotoxicity mediated by excessive Glutamatergic Stimulation (Neuroprotective)

---

# GABA

- Major inhibitory transmitter in CNS.
- Fast inhibition through GABA-A receptor (pentameric ionotropic receptor found postsynaptically - Conducts Cl⁻ Influx to hyperpolarised the cell).
- Slow inhibitions through GABA-B receptor (Presynaptic and Postsynaptic GPCRs - Activate Gi/Go to increase K⁺ Conductance and Decrease Ca²⁺ Influx to hyperpolarise the cell and prevent neurotransmitter release).

---

# GABA-A Receptor

- It has a GABA Site that binds GABA and has many other allosteric sites that bind other ligands
- Barbiturate site - This is the site of Barbiturate and Benzodiazepine Site which Bind Benzodiazepines.
- When these drugs bind to these sites, they increase the activity of Cl⁻ channel and hence, increase the activity of GABA.
- Steroid site - This is found between the Barbiturate and Benzodiazepine Sites and is where volatile anaesthetics and steroids bind.

![Screenshot 2021-12-02 at 00.43.55.png](%5BUMP2019%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Synaptic%20Transmission%2076a777ce98f343bcbce55f05265dd123/Screenshot_2021-12-02_at_00.43.55.png)

- GABA can produce excitatory effects via Disinhibition
- When GABAergic Neurons directly project to structures, they produce inhibition here
- However, if GABAergic, NAergic and Opioid Neurons project to an inhibit GABAergic Neurons, these GABAergic Neurons will be inhibited, producing a disinhibition that increases the activity of the structure innervated by the Inhibited GABAergic Neuron
- Glutamatergic Neurons are highly modulated presynaptically by GABA-B and postsynaptically by GABA-A and GABA-B, stimulated by GABAergic Interneurons

- Found and act in CNS.
- Often co-released with other transmitters (synaptic not hormonal).
- Different life cycle from other neurotransmitters (single release AKA not recycled).
- Cause important long-term changes in activity.
- Excitatory or inhibitory depending on receptor coupling/signalling (metabotropic).

| Peptide Class | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Opioids | Enkephalin, Dynorphin, Endorphin |
| NPYs | Neuropeptide Y, Pancreatic Polypeptide |
| Tachykinins | Substance P/SP, Neurokinin A/NKA, Neurokinin B/NKB |
| Insulins | Insulin, Insulin-Like Growth Factor/ILGF |
| Gastrins | Gastrin, Cholecystokinin/CCK |

- γ and δ receptors are coupled to Gi whereas κ receptor is coupled to Gi/o
- Activation of Gi by γ and δ stimulation inhibits Adenylyl Cyclase and reduces cAMP levels which opens K⁺ Channels to allow for K⁺ Efflux whilst κ receptor stimulation further opens K⁺ Channels but also Inhibits Ca²⁺ Channels, reducing Ca²⁺ Influx
- Opioids are usually inhibitory but can cause excitation via disinhibition (Inhibiting Inhibitory Neurons)
