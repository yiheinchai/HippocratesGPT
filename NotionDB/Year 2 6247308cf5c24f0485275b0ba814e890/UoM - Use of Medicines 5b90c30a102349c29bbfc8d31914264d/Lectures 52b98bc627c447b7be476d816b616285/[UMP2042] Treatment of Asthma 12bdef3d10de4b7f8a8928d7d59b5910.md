# Asthma

- 10-12% of the Population suffer with Asthma, commonly presenting in Childhood
- The prevalence of Asthma over time is increasing and may be due to changes in Pollution levels

### Hallmarks

- Bronchial hyperreactivity (Increased Bronchoconstriction in response to inflammatory stimuli like Histamine ‚Üí Produces no effect on FEV1 on Normal Px but reduces FEV1 in Asthma Px, which is proportional to the severity of the Asthma)
- Late phase response in asthma ‚Üí Allergen/Irritant causes Initial Bronchoconstriction (Lowers FEV1) from which the Px recovers shortly. Whilst this is seen in both normal and Asthmatic Pxs, Asthmatic Pxs show a delayed and prolonged decrease in FEV1 due to the response of the Irritant)
- Magnitude of Late Phase Response can be reduced by Phosphodiesterase Type IV Inhibitor

### Asthma

- Bronchial hyperreactivity to a variety of stimuli.
- Airways obstruction that is reversible (at least to a significant degree) ‚Üí Important in Dx.
- Increased Mucous Secretion, which may occlude airways
- These all lead to Airways inflammation

### Types of Asthma

| Clinical Asthma Phenotype | TH2 Cell | Mechanism or Effector Cells |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Allergen ‚Üí Most Common in Childhood | Yes | IL-4, 5, 9, 13, 17, 25, 33, TSLP,CD4+ cells, DCs, eosinophils, mast cells, basophils, NKT cells. |
| Viral Infection | No | IL-13, alveolar macrophages, NKT cells (innate immune cells). |
| Air pollution, Cigarette Smoke, Diesel
Particulates and Smoke | No | IL-17, oxidative stress, small
particles, neutrophils, NKT cells. |
| NSAIDs | No | Leukotrienes, loss of prostaglandin E2. |
| Obesity | No | Oxidative stress |
| Severe, Steroid Resistant (Brittle) | No | IL-17, neutrophils, NKT cells. |
| Exercise and Cold Air | No | Heat transfer, change in mucosal osmolality, cytokines. |
| Intrinsic | ? ‚Üí Unknown Pathophysiology | Smooth muscle irritability |

# Allergen - Mechanism of Pathogenesis

- Mechanism underlying Initiation of Asthma are unknown but it is believed to be a combination of Genetic and Environmental Factors
- Following Initiation, it can become Chronic, which is associated with Airway Remodelling, often characterised by Stable Asthma (Where Asthma is ASx) between Acute Exacerbations (Asthma Attacks) due to Bronchoconstriction, which can cause Airway Occlusion if untreated
- These Acute Exacerbations are Rx by Bronchodilators
- Asthma in Children may disappear with Age via an Unknown Mechanism but may involve maturation of Immune System that removes Hypersensitivity of Bronchioles
- CD4+ cell is activated by:
1. MHC Class II with an antigen being presented by antigen presenting cell to T cell, recognised by T cell receptor. TCR recognises mixture of antigen within MHC
Class II.
2. Co-regulatory molecules.
3. Local environment which T cell is in (cytokine environment).
- Once activated, T cell can differentiate:
1. TH1 mediate by IL-12. Go on to produce IFNùõæ, which inhibits TH2 differentiation.
2. TH2 mediated by IL-4. Go on to produce IL-4 which inhibits TH1 differentiation.
- In Allergic Asthma, there is a predominance of TH2 over TH1 ‚Üí This leads to Increased IgE Production and Mast Cell + Eosinophil Activation, producing the Allergic Reaction

---

# IgE and Mast Cell Activation

- Following Initial Exposure to the Allergen, there is the production of IgE specific to the Allergen, which binds to FcùúñR1 receptors found on mast cells to sensitise them to the Allergen
- Upon Subsequent Allergen presentation, the poyvalent antigen cross-links with at least 2 antibody receptor complexes causing ‚Üë Intracellular Ca¬≤‚Å∫ and degranulation, releasing histamine and leukotrienes.

- As Asthma Progresses, Airway Remodelling can be seen, including Fibrosis, Smooth Muscle Hyperplasia,  Hypersensitivity to Bronchoconstrictors and Hyposensitivity to Anti-Inflammatory Agents like Steroids

---

# Asthma Bronchiole Blockage

- In the airways of an Asthmatic Px, the Epithelial Layer becomes discontinuous, exposing underlying Mesenchymal and Immune Cells so that they can interact directly with allergens in the Airway
- There is Smooth Muscle Hyperplasia, Excessive Basement Membrane Deposition (Hyperplasia) and Immune Infiltration
- Occlusion of airways can arise due to Airway Inflammation, Excess Mucous Production and Smooth Muscle Hyperplasia.

# Early-Late Phase Responses

- Early responses: Bronchoconstriction due to mast-cell activation and degranulation, releasing pro-inflammatory mediators ‚Üí Tissue Resident Macrophages may also contribute to proinflammatory mediator release
- Late responses: inflammatory response (oedema, mucous) due to recruitment of Immune Cells like Th2 and Eosinophils

![Screenshot 2022-02-13 at 15.03.29.png](%5BUMP2042%5D%20Treatment%20of%20Asthma%2012bdef3d10de4b7f8a8928d7d59b5910/Screenshot_2022-02-13_at_15.03.29.png)

### Mediators

**Amines**

- Histamine
- 5-HT

**Cytokines**

- IL-1
- IL-3
- IL-4 (TH2 like cytokine)
- IL-5 (TH2 like cytokine)
- IL-6
- IFNùõæ (TH1 like cytokine)
- GM-CSF

**Eicosanoids (Lipids)**

- PGD2
- LTC4
- LTD4
- LTB4
- PAF
- Mast Cells release Leukotrienes that may contribute to Bronchoconstriction and Bronchospasm with Histamine and PGD2 also being significant
- Mast Cells also release Chemotaxins, causing recruitment and infiltration of Th2 cells into the Airways, leading to Eosinophil and potentially, Neutrophil Activation in the Late Phase Response
- Eosinophils and Neurotrophils can release proinflammatory mediators like Leukotrienes and Neuropeptides that contribute to Airway Inflammation and Hyperreactivity
- Eosinophils can release Eosinophilic Cation Protein and Eosinophilic Major Basic Protein which can cause Epithelial Damage, leading to Hyperreactivity and the release of further Proinflammatory Mediators

# Subdivisions of Asthma

- Asthma can be divided into Th2 (Mainly Childhood Onset) and Non-Th2 Type (Mainly Adult Onset) Asthmas based on the role of Th2 in the Pathophysiology of the Asthma
- Th2 Asthma includes Allergic Asthma

![Screenshot 2022-02-14 at 16.43.13.png](%5BUMP2042%5D%20Treatment%20of%20Asthma%2012bdef3d10de4b7f8a8928d7d59b5910/Screenshot_2022-02-14_at_16.43.13.png)

---

# Asthma Temporal Profile

- Over time, there are variable levels of airway inflammation, with there being localised spikes in airway inflammation/Sx causing Asthma Exacerbations
- Therefore, Rx of Asthma is focused on Controlling Sx, Preventing Exacerbations and reducing Underlying Inflammation (Achieve Current Control of Disease and Reduce Future Associated Risk)
- Current Control of Disease = Reduced Sx, Reduced Use of Relievers, Improved Lung Function
- Reduction of Future Risk = Prevent Worsening of Asthma, Permanent Reduction in Lung Function, Reduced Adverse Medication Effects and Reduce Exacerbations

---

# Drugs

- Relievers: relieve acute symptoms (mainly bronchoconstriction).
- Controllers: control underlying pathology to prevent progression of disease and associated reduced lung function (usually by controlling function).
- Some drugs can show both Reliever and Controlling Activity (E.g ùú∑ Agonists and M3 Antagonists)

![Screenshot 2022-02-13 at 15.24.30.png](%5BUMP2042%5D%20Treatment%20of%20Asthma%2012bdef3d10de4b7f8a8928d7d59b5910/Screenshot_2022-02-13_at_15.24.30.png)

### ùú∑2 Antagonists

- Example: noradrenaline, terbutaline, formoterol, salbutamol, salmeterol.
- Short (4 hours) E.g Salbutamol or long-lasting (12 hours) inhalation E.g Salmeterol.
- Stimulate ùú∑2 to ‚Üë cAMP, causing bronchodilation, acting on smooth muscle.
- They may act by stabilising mast cells too

### Muscarinic Antagonists

- Example: atropine, ipratropium bromide.
- Ipratropium bromide is an atropine like drug.
- These are particularly useful in Px with underlying cardiovascular disease who cannot take ùõΩ2 agonists, because they often have ùõΩ1 (heart) effects which can exacerbate heart dysfunction.
- Instead, they take muscarinic antagonists.
- Used to inhibit acetylcholine bronchoconstriction.
- Do not affect histamine or leukotriene mediated constriction.
- Side Effects include Dry Mouth and Coughing
- Recently, Muscarinic Antagonists have been used alongside ùú∑2 Agonists in Px with Difficult to Manage Asthma but they have been shown to have a greater efficacy in COPD, where ACh is likely to be the major mediator of Bronchoconstriction

### Theophylline (Methylxanthines)

- Type 4 phosphodiesterase inhibitor, preventing breakdown of cAMP into AMP within Bronchiole Smooth Muscle, producing Bronchodilation
- They are associated with a wide range of side effects due to their relatively low specificity and show less efficacy than ùú∑2 Agonists
- More Selective Type IV Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors have been developed but are not used in Asthma (They are used in COPD)
- Also believed to affect adenosine receptors.

# Leukotriene Antagonists

- Phospholipase A2 releases phospholipid from membrane to form arachidonate/arachidonic acid.
- Glucocorticoids inhibit phospholipase A2 and inhibit COX-2 expression. NSAIDs inhibit COX.
- Leukotrienes have arachidonate as their substrate, but these are converted to leukotrienes (Leukotriene B4 and Cysteinyl Leukotrienes) by 5-lipoxygenase.
- Taking NSAIDs inhibit COX.
- This causes arachidonate to build-up,
and this enters leukotriene pathway.
- Suggested to cause asthma attack (bronchoconstriction).

![Screenshot 2022-02-13 at 15.28.00.png](%5BUMP2042%5D%20Treatment%20of%20Asthma%2012bdef3d10de4b7f8a8928d7d59b5910/Screenshot_2022-02-13_at_15.28.00.png)

### Leukotrienes

- Leukotriene B4 is raised in Asthmatic Px where it may be responsible for Leukocyte Migration and IgE Synthesis that mediates Inflammatory Basis of Asthma
- Cysteinyl leukotrienes (C4, D4, E4) (secreted by mast cells, basophils and eosinophils)
- LTD4 and LTE4 can act via Cys-LT1 to:
1. Cause bronchospasms
2. Recruit eosinophils
3. Plasma Exudation
- LTC4 can act via Cys-LT2 to:
1. Cause smooth muscle contraction in pulmonary vessels.

![Screenshot 2022-02-13 at 15.30.02.png](%5BUMP2042%5D%20Treatment%20of%20Asthma%2012bdef3d10de4b7f8a8928d7d59b5910/Screenshot_2022-02-13_at_15.30.02.png)

### Zileuton

- Inhibits 5-lipoxygenase Auxiliary Protein, preventing 5-Lipoxygenase Activity to prevent Arachidonic Acid from being metabolised down the Leukotriene Pathway

### Montelukast

- Receptor antagonist for Cysteinyl leukotrienes (inhibiting bronchospasms, bronchoconstriction and eosinophil recruitment).
- Montelukast seems to show better clinical efficacy than Zileuton

---

# Anti-Inflammatory Steroids (SAIDs)

- E.g Cortisol, Prednisolone, Prednisone, Dexamethasone, Betamethasone
- These are effective for the Long Term Control of Inflammation underlying Asthma Pathology
- SAIDs have been altered for different routes of Administration (Inhaler, Creams, Pills and Nasal Spray) to prevent Systemic Distribution that can suppress the HPA Axis or cause Cushing‚Äôs Syndrome
- Beclomethasone ‚Üí Long Acting and Potent SAID that is inhaled

---

# Cromoglicate and Nedocromil

- Mast cell stabiliser, preventing degranulation and the release of Proinflammatory Mediators that produce Inflammation underlying Asthma Pathophysiology.
- They may inhibit T Cells as well
- They used to be used to Rx Long Term Asthma instead of Glucocorticoids but are now being replaced by Leukotriene Antagonists like Montelukast

---

# Omalizumab

- Biologic for allergic asthma.
- Antibody against Fc region of IgE.
- IgE can still bind to its receptor on mast cell but steric hinderance caused by Omalizumab means that the IgE cannot form cross-linking complexes with multiple receptor antibody complexes, preventing mast cell degranulation.
- Works in some patients, with variable results, but is expensive.

# Integrated Pharmacology of Asthma (From Mild Intermittent to Severe Persistent)

### Asthma Treatment Strategies

- Use of Preferred Reliever to Relieve Sx of Day-to-Day Asthma Sx and overcome exacerbations
- In Escalation, where Relievers are unable to effectively manage Sx, Controllers (E.g Low Dose Controllers) are used alongside Relievers
- Following this, Longer Acting Relievers (Like LABA E.g Salmeterol) might be added and if Asthma is still not controlled, Dosage may be increased or Leukotriene Antagonist like Montelukast may be prescribed

### Integrated Pharmacology

1. Short-acting ùõΩ agonist for relief from Day to Day Sx and Overcoming Acute exacerbations.
2. Inhaled low dose glucocorticoid.
3. Inhaled glucocorticoid with long lasting ùõΩ agonist.
4. Inhaled low dose glucocorticoid with leukotriene modifier or Higher Dose Glucocorticoid.
5. High Dose Inhaled Glucocorticoid with long lasting ùõΩ agonist with anti-IgE or other Biologics.

### Ongoing Problem

- Estimated that 90% of drugs currently on market only work in 40% of patients which take them.
- This translates to $350 billion worth of ineffective/wasted prescriptions.
- This equates to roughly ¬£5-8 billion wasted on ineffective prescription (depending on prediction - 4-7% of NHS budget).

### Stratification of Px

- Stratification of Px can be used to ensure that Drugs are used in groups of Px where they will be clinically effective
- Here, Px are identified with a specific Phenotype of a disease so that drugs can be selected that target the specific Disease Phenotype and its underlying Pathophysiology to maximise the likelihood of treatments being effective
- E.g Mepolizumab = mAb vs IL-5 which was unsuccessful in the Rx of General Asthma but due to the role of IL-5 in Eosinophil Activation, it was identified to show effectiveness on Severe Eosinophilic Asthma where it decreased exacerbations and allowed for gradual glucocorticoid withdrawal without increases in Inflammation/Exacerbations occurring
- Asthma Phenotypes can be determined, based on whether Asthma Developed in Childhood/Adulthood, whether Eosinophilic Infiltration is seen
- E.g Allergic Asthma = Childhood Onset with Eosinophilic Infiltration whereas Obesity Asthma = Adult Onset with no Eosinophilic Infiltration
