# [UMP2041] Drug Toxicity

# Intro and Plant and Animal Toxins

### Intro

- All substances are poison - The right dose differentiates a poison and a remedy.
- Toxicology: qualitative and quantitative study of the adverse effects of toxicants (Natural or Man-Made) on biological organisms
- There are 3 types of toxic hazardous materials - Chemical, Biological and Physical agents
- Toxicants = Chemical or Physical agents that produce a variety of adverse effects on biological organisms, which can be systemic or localised to specific tissues/metabolic pathways
- Toxins = Specific protein produced by a living organism
- Poisons = Toxicants that cause immediate death or illness when experienced in very small amounts
- All Toxins are toxicants but not all toxicants are toxins
- Toxins can be Systemic or Organ Toxins, which can affect the entire body/entire organs (E.g Cyanide) or specific target tissues/organs (E.g Benzene → Haematopoetic System, CNS and Kidneys)

### Classes of Toxins

- Metals
- Agricultural Chemicals (E.g Herbicides, Insecticides)
- Food Additives and Contaminants (E.g Preservatives, Taste Modification and Nutritional Supplements)
- Toxins (Toxicant produced by living organism. E.g Animal and Plant Toxins)
- Solvents
- Therapeutic Drugs
- Drugs of Abuse (Drugs with no medicinal function or taken at dose levels higher than that which would be required for therapy)
- All Drugs are toxic at some high dose

### Plant and Animal Toxins

- Exposure of humans to chemicals was for a long time via naturally occurring components (e.g. food plants).

### Deadly Nightshade (Belladonna)

- 3 berries can kill a child.
- Molecular target: tropane alkaloids that target muscarinic receptor (parasympathetic nervous system).
- Symptoms: vary with amount ingested. Tachycardia, hallucinations, blurred vision, loss of balance, difficulties in
speaking, excitement, dry throat, dilated pupils (typical symptoms of an atropine poisoning).
- Treatment: antidote neostigmine or physostigmine to increase [ACh] which outcompetes the Tropane Alkaloids to reduce inhibition of mAChRs that produces toxicity.

### Amanita Muscaria (Fly Fungus)

- Mushroom (fruit body) of a fungus.
- Molecular target: parasympathomimetic (muscarine) targeting muscarinic receptor (activates parasympathetic nervous system).
- Muscarine is an agonist of GPCR in peripheral parasympathetic nervous system. Does not cross BBB.
- It also produces a psychoactive alkaloid (muscimol), which is a GABA-A receptor agonist. Crosses BBB and acts centrally where it causes Sedation, Hypnosis and Hallucination.
- Symptoms: ↑ salivation, sweating and tearflow followed by abdominal pain, severe nausea, diarrhoea, blurred vision and breathing difficulties.
- Death is rare but can be caused if Toxin causes Cardiac/Respiratory Failure
- Treatment: atropine to reduce stimulation of mAChRs by Muscarine

### Fox Glove (Digitalis Purpurea)

- Leaves and upper stem particular toxic.
- Cardiac glycosides (digoxin) are found in the Leaves of the Upper Stem.
- Initial symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, hallucinations, delirium, severe headache, Xanthopsia.
- Severe symptoms: irregular and slow pulse and final heart block, tremors, convulsion.
- Treatment (depending on severity of intoxication):
- Fluid replacement in particular K⁺ sparing diuretic, K⁺ rich food (sweet potato, papaya, banana) to correct Hypokalaemia.
- Administration of activated charcoal.
- Digoxin-specific antibody fragments to inactivate Digoxin.

### Fugu (Puffer Fish)

- Fugu rubripes contains enough toxin to kill up to 30 people in a matter of seconds.
- It is 160,000 x more potent than cocaine.
- Toxin found in ovary, liver, skin, testicles of fugu.
- Neurotoxin (tetrodotoxin, TTX): blocks voltage-gated Na⁺ channels.
- If it is ingested, it causes paralysis of muscles but leaves person fully conscious, because it does not cross BBB → Death occurs due to asphyxiation following Respiratory Muscle Paralysis.
- Treatment:
- No antidote
- Counteraction involves administration of activated charcoal and standard life-support measures until toxin is excreted.

### Shellfish (Algae, Dinoflagellates, Marine Plankton)

- Paralytic shellfish poisoning (red tide).
- Shellfish consume (filter feed) and accumulate and biotransform phytoplankton, which produces Saxitoxin.
- Neurotoxin (saxitoxin, STX): blocks voltage-gated Na⁺ channels.
- Tingling in lips, ↓ of motor abilities, difficulty breathing, flaccid paralysis, but person is fully conscious, because STX does not cross BBB.
- Death occurs due to respiratory failure.
- Treatment:
- No antidote
- Counteractions involve administration of activated charcoal and standard life-support measures until toxin is excreted.

# Dose-Effect Curves

- Therapeutic Index = LD50/ED50
- LD50 = Median Lethal Dose (Dose that produces Death in 50% of the Population)
- ED50 = Median Effective Dose (Dose that produces Therapeutic Effects in 50% of the Population)
- As Drugs often produce multiple therapeutic effects, the ED50 is specific to the Therapeutic Effect under examination and hence, there are different Therapeutic Indices for different therapeutic effects produced by a single drug
- Therapeutic Window = Range of Drug Doses that produces Therapeutic Effects without/with minimal Toxicity
- Due to Pharmacodynamic Variations within the Population, Higher doses that produce Therapeutic Effects in the majority of the Population may cause Toxic Effects in a small proportion of the Population
- Toxicologists used Experimental Animal Models to determine the toxic effects of Drugs on Living Organism and predict their effects on Humans
- They also will test High Doses of a Drug from a Dose-Response Curve to observe sustained/consistent toxic effects to establish a statistically significant association between a drug and its toxic effects

### NOAEL and LOAEL

- NOAEL = No Observed Adverse Effect Level → Highest Dose used that does not produce a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of a Negative Health Effect/Toxic Effect
- LOAEL = Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level → Lowest Dose used that produces a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of a Negative Health Effect/Toxic Effect
- Below the NOAEL, there is uncertainty in the relationship between Dose and Toxic Response due to variations in the occurrence of Toxicity at different doses within the Population
- Due to this variability within a population in the incidence of Toxic Effects at doses below NOAEL, A Dose that is <10% of NOAEL (Reference Dose) is determined for each source of uncertainty, which is used as the starting point in Investigations to determine at which dose toxicity occurs
- T = Threshold Dose
- Subchronic Exposure Models involving Toxicants and Animals provide a model for Occupational Exposure to a drug

- The Most Potent Toxin is the Botulinum Toxin
- Diptheria Toxin ADP-Ribosylates and hence, inactivates an Elongation Factor to prevent Translocation of the Ribosome during Translation in Eukaryotic Organisms
- Cyanide - This is rather low potency toxin that Inhibits Cytochrome C Oxidase, to inhibit the ETC and prevent Respiration
- Cyanide Poisoning is Rx using Lilly Cyanide Antidote Kit (Amyl Nitrite, Sodium Nitrite and Sodium Thiosulphate) with High Dose Oxygen
- In this Therapy, Nitrates/Nitrites bind to Hb to form Methaemoglobin, which has a higher affinity for Cyanide than Cytochrome C Oxidase. This means that Cyanide binds to Methaemoglobin rather than Cytochrome C Oxidase, causing Cyanide to dissociated from Cytochrome C and hence, prevents inhibition of ETC by Cyanide that produces Toxicity
- Sodium Thiosulphate reacts with the Cyanide to form a soluble product that can be excreted in the Urine

# Drug Intoxication

### Acetylsalicylic Acid (Aspirin)

- Analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, stimulation of leukocytes and anti-platelet effect.
- Molecular target: inhibits COX, ↓ prostanoid synthesis. Also causes uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.
- Poisoning can cause Metabolic Acidosis, Convulsions, Coma, Hyperpyrexia/Fever, Pulmonary Oedema and Renal Failure
- Treatment:
1. Administration of activated charcoal.
2. Gastric lavage to clear aspirin from stomach to reduce absorption, alkaline diuresis with bicarbonate to increase renal clearance of Aspirin (reduce Plasma Concentration), haemodialysis to remove Aspirin from the Blood (Notably when Plasma [ ] is very high).
- Pharmacokinetic: If Plasma [ ] is very high, it is eliminated by zero-order kinetics

### Paracetamol (Acetaminophen)

- Antipyretic and analgesic.
- Symptoms: abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, sweating, jaundice, convulsions and coma and in late stages, Hepatic Damage.
- Symptoms may not occur until 12 or more hours after intoxication
- Treatment:
1. Activated charcoal
2. Acetylcysteine
3. ↑ glutathione or methionine.

- Herbicides
- Pesticides - Organophosphates and Sheep dip (also here organophosphates are used).
1. Industrial chemicals:
- Dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) - This was released into the Environment in the Seveso Disaster, leading to the development of Cancer, Immunosuppression and Skin Disfiguration

# Selective History of Drug Monitoring And Reasons for Drug Withdrawal

### 1937

- Sulphanilamide
- People wanted to have drug not only as
a powder and tablet, but also as a solution.
- Glycol (antifreeze) was used to give drug in solution, which led to death. This results in FDA Cosmetic Act (1938).

### 1960s

- Phenacetin
- Side effect is renal damage.
- Thalidomide
- Teratogenic drug
- Clioquinol
- Acts on CN II causing Subacute Myealo-Optic Neuropathy

### 1970s

- Practolol → β Blocker
- Toxicity and damage to eye, fatal
sclerosing of serous membrane in abdomen, lungs or heart

### 1982

- Benoxaprofen
- Fatal hepatic reaction in elderly. Antiarrhythmic drug.
- Fenclofenac
- Skin rashes, gut disorders, suspected
carcinogenicity.
- Nomifensine
- Immune haemolytic anaemia.

### 1992

- Germander
- Herbal remedy derived from plant which caused Hepatitis

### Poisoning

- Usually occurs at home in Px < 6 years old, most commonly involving Analgesics and Cleaning Substances

# Types of Drug Toxicity

1. Cytotoxicity: cell death and necrosis.
- Example: paracetamol (liver injury), aspirin (gastric ulceration) and basic/acidic agents.
1. Carcinogenesis: single, low exposure may be enough to cause Carcinogenesis. Cancer may develop after months/years (stilboestrol). Rather few drugs other than chemotherapeutics are carcinogenic.
2. Mutagenesis: permanent change to DNA of germ cells, allowing mutations to be inherited.
3. Drug allergy: relatively common, commonly causing skin rashes. 
4. Antibody to drug or drug conjugate with protein can cause Anaphylactic shock, which is potentially life-threatening.
5. Teratogenesis: name implies gross abnormalities of baby. Serious defects from exposure in first trimester (period of organogenesis) but effect of drug on Foetal Development occurs when it was given in the First Trimester.
- Example: thalidomide and Ethanol
- Ethanol can cause FAS (foetal alcohol syndrome) that can be so severe it is fatal but most Px with FAS do not have brains with significant abnormalities (Severe FAS can cause Corpus Callosum Agenesis)
- Effect of FAS on Specific Organ is also determined by when the drug is given during the First Trimester

# Selected List of Teratogens

| Agent | Clinical Effects |
| --- | --- |
| ACEi | Renal Damage |
| Aminoglycosides | CN VIII Toxicity |
| Cocaine | Limb and urinary tract defects, congenital heart
disease. |
| Ethanol | Foetal alcohol syndrome: craniofacial defects,
growth retardation. |
| Phenytoin | Cleft lip and palate |
| Tetracycline | Discolouration and defects of teeth, altered
bone growth. |
| Thalidomide | Phocomelia |
| Valproic Acid | Various, especially spina bifida. |

### Phenytoin In Pregnancy

- Genetic factors or epileptic conditions itself may be more important than drug therapy in leading to birth defects.
- There may be a natural incidence of condition (e.g. cleft palate), making it
difficult to make a specific case for drug.
- Great majority of mothers on anticonvulsant medication delivery
normal infants.
- Anticonvulsant drugs should not be discontinued in patients In whom drug is administered to prevent major seizures because of strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with attendant hypoxia and threat to life (both on mother and child).
- Treatment may be essential for mother
(life-saving).
- It cannot be said with any confidence that even minor seizures do not pose some hazard to developing embryo or foetus.
- Consequence of not treating may be worse for developing baby.
- Phenytoin should only be used during pregnancy, if in judgement of physician that potential benefit clearly outweighs risks.

### Consequences of Time of Exposure on Teratogenesis of Thalidomide

| Day of Gestation | Defect |
| --- | --- |
| 21-22 | Absence of external ears, paralysis of cranial nerves. |
| 24-27 | Phocomelia maximal, mainly affecting arms. |
| 28-29 | Phocomelia affecting legs |
| 34-36 | Hypoplastic thumbs, anorectal stenosis. |
| End of Sensitive Period |  |

# Mechanism of Toxicity

- Receptors/ion channels: morphine, atropine (deadly nightshade), TTX, STX, 𝛼-bungarotoxin (Krait snake).
- Enzymes/biochemical pathways: Aspirin (uncouples oxidative phosphorylation), cyanide on Cytochrome C, digitoxin (Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase).
- ↑ intracellular [Ca²⁺]: normally, Intracellular [Ca²⁺] is very low. Excitotoxicity (glutamate) can cause Intracellular [Ca²⁺] to rise, leading to the activation of damaging intracellular enzymes.
- DNA: target for carcinogens and mutagens. Alkylating and intercalating agents (N-7 of guanine is a common site for alkylation).
- Intercalating agents can alter Transcription and DNA Synthesis
- Initiating and promoting agents (well-known promotes are phorbol ester - e.g. tobacco, barbecue).

---

# Active Metabolites of Drugs

- Drug metabolism may give rise to a more reactive product or give rise to damaging oxygen radicals.
- Example: paracetamol hepatotoxicity is due to a metabolite produced by oxidation.
- 2% of paracetamol is directly excreted in urine.
- 90% is glucoronidated so that it is excreted as non-toxic glucuronic acid and sulphates in the urine.
- Smaller amount is converted by cytochrome P-450, to produce NAPQI, which is conjugated with glutathione (found in limited supply) to form mercapturate.
- When Paracetamol is given in low doses, the Glutathione Capacity is not exceeded so all Paracetamol that is not excreted in the Urine can be conjugated to Glutathione
- NAPQI is very reactive and when found in high concentrations due to High Doses of Paracetamol, the Glutathione Stores of the Liver is exhausted causing NAPQI to accumulate and destroy hepatic cells.
- To Rx Paracetamol Overdose, give N-Acetylcysteine or methionine to allow conversion of NAPQI to mercapturate to prevent NAPQI Accumulation and hence, hepatic damage.

# Selective Tissue Toxicity

- Potential causes for selective tissue toxicity: local concentration, local generation of reactive metabolites, local targets.
- Aminoglycosides → Deafness
- Paracetamol → Liver failure
- Tetracyclines → Damage to teeth
- Gentamycin → Become concentrated in renal tubule cells where it can cause nephrotoxicity.
- Sulphonamides → Low aqueous solubility causes crystalluria.
- Methanol (formaldehyde) → Optic nerve damage.
- Chloroquine → Melanin affinity, retinal toxicity.

---

# How to Determine How Toxic a Drug Is?

- Mortality/morbidity rates are difficult to calculate. Death is most easily measured, but obviously can only get figures for animals.
- Problem that toxicity events in Humans are low incidence (rare) so there is little evidence outlining toxic effects in Humans.
- Requirement for animal tests to determine toxic effects in Animals.
- An acute test is LD50 (dose which kills 50% of exposed population, in a specified short period of time).

![Screenshot 2022-02-13 at 13.40.35.png](%5BUMP2041%5D%20Drug%20Toxicity%204df0eb3ea4b842ecaf5bfc070aa34cb9/Screenshot_2022-02-13_at_13.40.35.png)

# Toxicity Testing (Animal Studies)

- Acute tests: LD50 crude test of lethality.
- Chronic tests: includes histological examination of any organs. Attention is paid to:
1. Species used: rodent and non-rodent.
2. Range of doses: clinical relevance and doses to produce some deaths.
3. Duration of study.
4. Appropriate to the intended use of the drug: carcinogenicity should be assessed by looking at an animal model for its lifetime to look for long term effects of Carcinogens
5. Number of animals - Minimum number to give statistically reliable results (use male and female animals).
- Draize test: surface application to eye to prevent systemic administration of the blood.

---

# Alternatives to Animal Testing

- Ames test: test for ability of drug (or metabolites) to induce mutations in bacteria.
- Uses a mutant bacterium which cannot
synthesise histidine.
- A mutagenic drug can produce a back
mutation which will allow bacterium to grow in absence of histidine due to restoring the function of the mutated gene that allows for Histidine Synthesis (may give indication of carcinogenic potential).
- Inclusion of liver homogenate allows for test of mutagenicity of drug metabolites produced within the liver.
- Tests for toxic action on mammalian cells in tissue culture to look for toxic effects in mammals.

---

# Avoidance of Toxicity

1. Banning unsafe drugs before any human use:
- Reliance on animal studies.
- Post-marketing surveillance (yellow cards).
1. Competent prescribing:
- Avoidance of overdose (only prescribe the amount of the drug that is necessary).
- ↓ dose in elderly.
- Change dose in light of toxicity (oestrogens).
- Avoid drug interactions.
1. Prevention of accidental ingestion:
- Prescription of small quantities.
- Child proof container.

---

# Treatment of Drug Overdose

- Initial decontamination: dilution (most common), irrigation/washing, activated charcoal
- Steps to enhance elimination: alkalinisation of urine (most common), haemodialysis, forced diuresis, haemoperfusion, exchange transfusion, acidification of urine.
- Antidote administration: Naloxone (Opiates), N-acetylcysteine (Paracetamol), atropine antivenin, ethanol (Methanol), hydroxycobalamin and pralidoxime (Cyanide).
