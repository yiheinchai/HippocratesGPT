# [UMP2022] Pharmacological Basis for the Treatment of Pain

# Pain

### Pain

- Sensory aspects of pain: threshold, intensity, location. (like other senses)
- Psychological aspects of pain: unpleasant, threatening, aversive.
- Social, economic issues: depression, anxiety, sleep disorders.
- Therefore, the presence of Psychological and Social aspects of Pain makes it a unique sensory experience

### Social and Cultural Issues

- There is no quantitative/objective measure of pain
- Females have higher pain tolerance (adaptation to childbirth),
- Males have higher pain threshold.
- Some forms of pain can be more prevalent in some Sexes (E.g Females more likely to have Migraines whereas other forms of Headache are more common in Men)
- Responses to pain often vary in individuals from different nationalities (usually based on emotional experiences)
- In right context, pain can be suppressed.
- When in pain, the nervous system focuses on pain as it is an important survival signal indicating impending/already sustained tissue damage

# Neural Connections and Associated Comorbidities

### Neural Connections

- Incoming peripheral nerves convey touch, temperature and painful messages (heat, mechanical, chemical).
- These can be altered by tissue and nerve damage
- Spinal cord integrates, amplifies (usually for nociceptive inputs) and modifies inputs and outputs to brain.
- Pain can then ascend to the Cerebral Cortex where the Somatotopic Organisation of S1 allows for the Localisation of Pain and encoding the Intensity of Pain
- Pain can also ascend to the Limbic brain (amygdala and hypothalamus) where it link affective (psychological) aspects of pain (fear, anxiety, sleep) and downregulates sensations of reward to deter individuals from experiencing the Noxious Stimulus again.
- Descending controls from brain to the spinal cord alters the magnitude pain, usually increase pain due to the importance of pain in survival and minimising injury.
- This is done via Peripheral (Affecting Peripheral Channels and Sensors + their Sensitivity) and Central/Spinal Cord Mechanisms (E.g Wind-Up)

### Associated Comorbidites

- From most patients being affected to those least affected: difficulty sleeping, lack of energy, drowsiness, concentration difficulties, depression, anxiety, poor appetite.
- These arise due to the activity of Ascending Nociceptive Signals from the Spinal Cord

---

# Types of Pain

- Some forms of pain can be a mixture of Inflammatory and Neuropathic Pain (i.e. low back pain, cancer pain)
- Surgery initially can cause Inflammatory Pain due to tissue damage but can cause Neuropathic Pain if nerves are damaged, causing persistent post-surgical pains

### Generalised Pain

- Pain present despite no obvious tissue or nerve damage (E.g Fibromyalgia)

### Inflammatory Pain (Tissue Damage)

- Pain caused by an inflammatory response to a noxious stimulus.
- This can be due to tissue damage or chemical inactivation

### Neuropathic Pain (Nerve Distribution)

- Pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or disease in peripheral or CNS.
- This can be due to Nerve damage or changes in activity in Ion Channels

### Chronic Non-Malignant Pain - Classification

| Neuropathic | Nociceptive (Inflammatory) | Generalised Pain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Trauma | Osteoarthritis - This is because Cartillage damage is permanent, causing persistent pain | Fibromyalgia |
| Diabetes - Diabetic Neuropathy can arise due to damage to Blood Vessels supplying nerves via Glycosylation, causing Nerve Damage (usually to distal ends of Nerves) | Rheumatoid Arthritis | Musculoskeletal Pain |
| Amputations | Post-Operative Pain | Tension Type Headache |
| Plexus Avulsions | Collitis | Irritable Bowel Disease |
| Post-Herpetic Neuralgia | Myositis | Interstitial Cystitis |
| Neuropathies | Migraine | Whiplash Injury |
| Spinal Injury | CRPS |  |
| HIV Neuropathy |  |  |
| Multiple Sclerosis |  |  |
| Post-Stroke |  |  |
| CRPS |  |  |
| Trigeminal Neuralgia |  |  |

### Peripheral Activity Causes Central Hyperexcitability

- In the Periphery, Tissue Damage leads to Chemical Activation of Nociceptors and Neuropathy leads to altered signalling in Damaged Nerves

---

# Peripheral Responses to Pain

- When there is tissue damage, Prostaglandins are released from the Blood
- Damaged tissue also becomes acidic (Release of H⁺ activates Acid-Sensitive Ion Channels to further stimulate Nociceptive Signalling), leading to the release of ATP (from damaged cells) and 5-HT which cause pain
- Substance P and CGRP sensitise Nociceptive Nerve Endings at low [ ] to make overlying tissue more sensitive and tender.
- This sensitivity means that Nociceptive Axons become Hyperexcitable and hence, fire more frequently, making stimulation of the affected area more painful (Hyperalgesia)
- At high [ ], they can activate C Fibres to stimulate increased nociceptive signalling down these Fibres
- They also stimulate vasculature to cause Vasodilation, causing Oedema

---

# NSAIDs and XOCIBS

- NSAIDs block cyclooxygenase enzymes 1 and 2 to prevent prostaglandin formation to prevent sensitisation by damaged tissue, inflammation and fever.
- NSAIDs = Non Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (aspirin and ibuprofen) block prostaglandins. Only work on low pain.
- However, as Prostaglandins (produced by COX1) are protective in the Stomach, the usage of NSAIDs (Notably in the Elderly) can cause GI Issues like Bleeding and Ulceration
- Therefore, COX2 Selective inhibitors do not impact the formation of Prostaglandins in the Stomach and hence, do not produce GI Side Effects
- However, they do alter Prostaglandin formation in the Heart which can cause Cardiac Side Effects
- Lignocaine/Lidocaine: local anaesthetic, preventing generation of nociceptive action potential.

### Other Drugs

- Triptans are 5HT1-R Antagonists which are inhibitory and active in Migraines (Therefore, they are effective in Rx Pain from Migraines)
- When Px have Migraines they have Aura and Visual Changes (Due to altered Central Processing of Visual Information) alongside Pain
- These are often triggered by poor sleep, hunger or excessive light
- Therefore, it has been suggested that Migraines arise due to abnormal Central Filtering of Sensory Information by 5-HT Systems
- Moreover, Peripheral Nerve Fibres release peptides like CGRP which cause Vasodilation - This can cause Headache via Vasodilation of Scalp and Meningeal Vessels
- Therefore, Antibodies to CGRP have long lasting effects in the Management of Migraine Pain
- Due to the role of 5-HT and CGRP in Migraines, Migraines appear to be a combination of Brain and Peripheral Changes

# Neuropathic Pain

### Symptoms of Neuropathic Pain

- Numbness and sensory loss
- Ongoing pain - Due to alterations in Nociceptive Signalling down Peripheral Nerves
1. Shooting, burning or electric shock-like
2. Numbness, pins and needles
- Hyperalgesia - Increased sensation of pain in response to normally painful stimuli
- Allodynia - Pain in response to normally non-painful stimuli (notably touch and cold)

### Mechanism of Action

- Neuropathic Pain happens due to upregulation of Na⁺ Channels and Downregulation of K⁺ Channels, making Nociceptive Neurons hyperexcitable
- There is also upregulation of Ca²⁺ Channels to increase Neurotransmission to further increase Nociceptive Transmission
- Lidocaine (Local) and Carbamazepine (Systemic - Used in Epilepsy) block Na⁺ Channels
- Opiods can indirectly open K⁺ Channels via their activity at Opiod Receptors
- Gabapentin and Pregabalin (Used in Epilepsy) modulate/reduce Ca²⁺ Channel activity to Inhibit Nociceptive Synaptic Transmission
- When nerves are damaged/damaged, this leads to sensory loss
- Ongoing Pain arises due to Ectopic, Abnormal Na⁺ Channel Activity leading to Hyperexcitability of Nociceptive Afferents
- Within Na⁺ Channels, there are 9 Subsets NaV1.1-1.9, with NaV1.7 and 1.8 being selectively expressed on Nociceptive Afferents/C Fibres
- This means that drugs against NaV1.7 and NaV1.8 would be pain selective that can be injected systemically without compromising excitability in other tissues (E.g Heart and ANS) or Numbness (Due to selective Block of C-Fibre Na⁺ Channels vs those expressed on Aβ Fibres)

# Channelopathic Pain Syndromes

- Loss of Function to NaV1.7 causes loss of Nociception whilst Gain of Function to NaV1.7 causes enhanced Nociception

![Screenshot 2022-01-13 at 01.04.42.png](%5BUMP2022%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%208073b129ec974759a15cf000a9f11702/Screenshot_2022-01-13_at_01.04.42.png)

# Calcium Channels and Analgesia

- α1 Subunit of Ca²⁺ Channels forms the Channel pore to allow Ca²⁺ Influx into the Spinal Cord
- α2δ Subunit is found embedded in the Cell Membrane and positions the α1 Transmembrane subunit in the correct location
- Pregabalin and Gabapentin bind to the α2δ Subunit of Ca²⁺ Channels expressed in the Spinal Cord to prevent the Insertion of Ca²⁺ Channels into the Cell Membrane
- This reduces Ca²⁺ Channels expression, preventing Ca²⁺ Influx and hence, Neurotransmitter release (Hence, blocks Nociceptive Neurotransmission in Ascending Nociceptive Pathways)
- Following Nerve Injury, there is upregulation of α2δ Subunit, which produces State Dependency in the Action of Gabapentin and Pregabalin, where they do not impact Normal Nociceptive Transmission (when there is no Nerve Injury) but prevent Hyperalgesia and Allodynia due to Peripheral Sensitisation that underly Neuropathic Pain

### Drug Targets to Prevent Nociceptive Signalling Into the Brain

- NSAIDs can be used to Manage Nociceptive/Inflammatory by preventing Prostaglandin Mediated Nociceptive Stimulation
- Lidocaine and Gabapentin can be used to Manage Neuropathic Pain by Antagonising Na⁺ and Ca²⁺ Channels respectively
- Therefore, Selective Diagnosis of Neuropathic and Inflammatory Pain as Drugs that Manage Inflammatory Pain prevent Chemical Activation whereas Drugs that Manage Neuropathic Pain prevent Electrical Activation/AP Generation by acting on Ion Channels expressed on Nerves

![Screenshot 2022-01-13 at 01.15.28.png](%5BUMP2022%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%208073b129ec974759a15cf000a9f11702/Screenshot_2022-01-13_at_01.15.28.png)

# Other Nociceptive Receptors

- TRPV Channels are activated at low doses by various chemicals found in food and may be involved in Flavour Perception
- However, at too high a concentration of these Chemicals can overstimulate these receptors and cause pain
- E.g TRPV1 (Heat Pain) is activated by Capsaicin in Chilli Peppers and when High [Capsaicin] is present in the Mouth (Eating Lots of Chilli), this can overactive TRPV1 to cause a Burning Sensation
- E.g TRPM8 (Cold Receptor) is activated by Mint and in Px with Allodynia, Cold Sensations can often be perceived as Painful, causing TRPM8 Overactivation to be perceived as Painful

---

# Wind-Up and Long Term Potentiation

- Repeated C fibre input Winds up spinal cord neurons (↑ their sensitivity), producing Allodynia.
- This is because Mg²⁺ block of NMDA receptor is removed by depolarisation from continuous stimulation.
- Like long-term potentiation, they become hyper-responsive to pain, meaning previous painless stimuli (Tactile and Cold) can now activate these Neurons to produce Nociceptive Stimulation.
- This occurs independent of Peripheral Activity (Tissue or Nerve Damage)
- Ketamine at low sub-anaesthetic doses can be used to block NMDA channel to prevent Wind-Up/Central Nociceptive Sensitisation.
- Side effects include dissociation, memory and cognitive disfunction
- It is sometimes used in Severe Acute pain but also in surgery to block wind-up and central sensitisation that occurs due to Tissue Damage.
- Widely used in palliative care for cancer pain, especially with end of life.

---

# Nociceptive Processing At Higher Centres

- Nuclei in the Limbic Cortex release NA and 5-HT onto the Spinal Cord via Descending Pathways
- Anti-depressants can be used in the Rx of Neuropathic Pain by blocking reuptake of NA and 5-HT, increasing synaptic [ ] to increased Descending Modulation of Nociceptive Signalling into the Spinal Cord to reduce Pain
- Antidepressants are more effective and quicker acting for the Rx of Neuropathic Pain than Depression

### NA and 5-HT in the Control of Pain

- Off cells in descending pathways allow pain to be turned down.
- On cells in descending pathways allow pain to be turned up.
- Limbic Cortex is disrupted by Nociceptive Input, producing emotional and sleep changes (Give rise of Comorbidities)
- Limbic Cortex projects to the Periaqueductal Grey, Locus Coeruleus and the Rostroventral Medial Medulla
- Locus Coeruleus projects to Spinal Neurons, releasing NA here to stimulate Postsynaptic α2 to inhibit Spinal Neurons and reduce pain
- 5-HT from the Rostroventral Medial Medulla has mixed effects on Spinal Neurons but is predominantly Excitatory at 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 to stimulate/enhance Pain (It is Inhibitory at 5-HT1, involved in Migraines)
- Normally, the balance of these Descending NA and 5-HT Systems are Balanced but in states of Persistent Pain, there is the loss of Descending NA Signalling and Enhancement of Descending 5-HT Signalling, causing Net Excitation of Spinal Nociceptive Neurons to increase Pain
- Placebo Analgesia seem to activate Descending NA Signalling and Endogenous Opioid Signalling which Inhibit Nociceptive Spinal Neurons to reduce pain
- Nocebos can Activate Descending 5-HT/Excitatory Systems to increase Pain sensation
- Endogenous Opioid Signalling is also involved in Exercise Induced Analgesia

![Screenshot 2022-01-13 at 01.37.10.png](%5BUMP2022%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20for%20the%20Treatment%20%208073b129ec974759a15cf000a9f11702/Screenshot_2022-01-13_at_01.37.10.png)

### Pain Interactions

- Pain in one region of the body can inhibit pain in another region (Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls/Conditioned Pain Modulation) through Descending NA Inhibitions
- This is a marker for the effectiveness of Intrinsic Pain Modulation by Descending Systems
- In conditions of Chronic Pain, there is a reduction of Conditioned Pain Modulation and Reduced CPM increases the risk of Chronic Post-Surgical Pain

### Can Central Events Drive Pain and Other Symptoms?

- In IBS and Fibromyalgia, there is widespread pain but with a normal periphery
- This may be due to a Failure of Descending Inhibitory Projections and Increased Excitatory Projects, causing Increased Net Excitation of Spinal Nociceptive Neurons to produce widespread pain

---

# AMPA and NMDA

- AMPA receptor: Touch and Acute pain.
- NMDA receptor: rapidly enhance pain via Wind-up

---

# Morphine and Codeine

- Heroin is a diacetylmorphine (acetyl groups prevent it working on neurones).
- Rapid penetration into CNS across the BBB (faster than morphine due to the presence of the acetyl groups) and is converted to morphine (losing acetyl groups which normally prevent its pharmacological action)
- Morphine works on GPCRs (Opioid Receptors) which are Inhibitory, opening K⁺ Channels to Hyperpolarise the cell and hence, prevent Neurotransmitter Release (If channels are found on the Nerve Terminal) or Nociceptive AP Generation (If channels are found on the axon)

---

# Opioid/Opiate Reeptors

- 4 opioid receptors.
- 𝜇 receptor named after morphine.
- Their normal agonists (Endogenous Opioids) are Peptides, which poorly penetrate membranes and are rapidly degraded by Peptidases. This means they often have low level, transient effects

| Receptor | 𝝁  | 𝜹 | 𝜿 | ORL-1 (Opioid
Receptor Like-1) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agonist | Endomorphins | Enkephalins | Dynorphin | Nociception |
| Drug | Morphine | DPDPE - Experimental | U50488H - Experimental | -  |
| Mechanism of Action | Opens K⁺ | Opens K⁺ | Closes Ca²⁺ Channels | Opens K⁺ |
|  | Most Clinically Used Drugs | Similar to 𝝁 but no drugs | Odd Side-Effects (More predominant in producing Analgesia in Females) | Analgesics but also can enhance pain |

---

# μ Opioids

- Morphine: gold standard. Can be given Oral, injected, slow release tablet - Dosage can be controlled easily over long periods of time.
- Codeine: Pro-drug for morphine. This means depending on the level of expression and activity of the enzyme that converts Codeine into Morphine, Codeine can either have little effect or produce significant side-effects (It is generally Weak)
- Fentanyl: fast on and off. Widely used for short, severe surgical procedures.
- Appears to be an attempt by criminals in China who are making large quantities, and putting it into heroin.
- Fentanyl is a very fast acting drug so easy to OD.
- Pethidine: childbirth.
- Heroin: morphine pro-drug. Fast. Diacetylmorphine.
- Naloxone: Antagonist of all opioid receptors.
- Used to reverse ODs.
- It is very potent but has a very short half life so multiple doses may need to be given to reverse an OD
- Tapentadol - Weak Opioid but also stimulates Increased Descending NA Nociceptive Inhibition, producing fewer side effects than other Opioids but still being effective

### Mechanisms

- Inhibitory GPCR
- Inhibits N-type Ca²⁺ channels.
- Open K⁺ channels in many neurones within the brain, brainstem and spinal cord.
- Opioid receptors in CNS and periphery (particularly gastro-intestinal tract).
- Stimulation of Opioid Receptors in Peripheral tissues can cause side effects (constipation).

# Mechanisms of Opioid Analgesia

- Incoming C and A𝛿 fibres from sensory neurones have cell bodies and are bipolar neurones.
- 75% of Opioid Receptors are presynaptic and when stimulated, inhibit release of transmitters (glutamate and peptides) from C and A𝛿 fibres.
- Remainder of Opioid Receptors Post-synaptic receptors hyperpolarise output neurone to inhibit the activity of the Postsynaptic neuronal activity.
- This prevents Hyperexcitability of Spinal Nociceptive Neurons
- Whilst the action of Opioids presynaptically (Major Action) is specific to C and A𝛿 fibres, their action postsynaptically (Minor Action) is not-neuron specific.
- A𝛽 fibres have no opiate receptors meaning tactile information is uninterrupted via the action of Opioids Presynaptically.
- Opioids also act centrally to reduce Descending Excitatory Control of Nociception by inhibiting On Cells and increase Descending Inhibitory Drive by stimulating Off Cells, producing a Net Inhibitory Descending Drive to Nociceptive Spinal Neurons to reduce Pain
- To produce action on the Spinal Cord, Opioids must be given locally to the Spinal Cord (E.g via Epidural)
- To produce action on the Brain, Opioids must be given systemically

### Spinal Opioid Analgesia

- Pre-synaptic Inhibition of Glutamate and Peptides (Substance P) release
- Post-Synaptic Inhibition of Spinal Neuron Activity

### Side Effects

- Sedation
- Respiratory depression (brainstem) - Reduced Hypercapnic Drive.
- Anti-tussive (brainstem) blocks cough reflex.
- Constipation (peripheral) enteric - Constipation by Inhibiting GI Motility and Secretion.
- Nausea and vomiting (CTZ). Opioids remove inhibition of dopamine, allowing vomiting. This can be minimised by giving a Px an Antiemetic at the same time like Domperidone.
- As Opioids can be both Anti-tussive and Pro-Emetic, this means Px can aspirate vomit easily
- Dependence (rare in patients). Patients do not appear to become dependent on opioids compared to street users.

### Not Side Effects

- Relief of anxiety: pre-op, street use.
- Anti-tussive: chest surgery.
- Constipation: bowel surgery, diarrhoea.

# Overview - Non-Opioid Analgesics

- NSAIDs and COXibs - inflammation
- Lignocaine, carbamazepine - Na channels - nerve injury
- Gabapentin - Ca channels - nerve injury
- Antidepressants - NA/5HT - nerve injury
- Triptans - 5HT1B/D receptors - headache
- Ketamine - NMDA - extreme pain
- Coproxamol - NSAID and Weak Opioid therefore can theoretically target Peripheral and Central Nociceptive Processing but are less frequently used due to risks of Overdose

---

# Dopamine and Reward

- Opioids inhibit GABAergic Neurons, producing Dinhibition of Central Dopamine Systems that increases [DA] in the VTA, producing reward
- Street Usage of Opioids rapidly cause dependence whereas Px do not tend to develop Dependence
- This is because via the Limbic Cortex, Pain inhibits Reward so when Px in Pain take Opioids, they do not trigger Reward and hence, do not lead to dependence
