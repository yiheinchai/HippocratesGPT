# [UMP2048] Drug Interactions

# Introduction

- Occur when administration of drug A alters effect of drug B.
- Usually, these refers to unwanted interactions which can put patients are at risk because they take lots of medicines for lots of different conditions (Polypharmacy ‚Üí Most commonly seen in Elderly Px).
- These can be harnessed therapeutically to reduce the dosage of drugs required to produce a specific effect - E.g Tacrolimus can be administered alongside Grapefruit Juice as Grapefruit Juice inhibits Hepatic Cytochrome P450 Enzymes which are responsible for metabolising Tacrolimus, causing Tacrolimus elimination to decrease so that smaller doses can be administered whilst still maintaining sufficient Plasma [Tacrolimus] to produce Therapeutic Effects
- However, this can also be harmful - E.g Terfenidine was used for the Rx of Hayfever but when it was coadministered with Grapefruit Juice, Inhibition of Cytochrome P450 led to reduced Terfenidine Elimination and hence, accumulation/persistence in the Plasma. This led to QT Interval Prolongation which increased the Incidence of Toursades de Pointes, increasing the risk of Mortality
- When a Px is under a Polypharmacy Drug Regime, when the Number of Drugs > 6, the Risk of a Polypharmaceutic Drug Interaction increases significantly to around 60%
- It is possible to predict interactions using knowledge of Pharmacology and how different drugs are metabolised/eliminated
- Drugs with a narrow therapeutic range are susceptible to drug interactions as any alterations in their metabolism/excretion due to the effects of another drug can cause small changes in [Drug] which can cause it to approach a Toxic or Non-Effective [ ].
- E.g If a Px with Epilepsy takes Sodium Valproate and they are then Rx with Merepenem (E.g for Pneumonia), this causes [Sodium Valproate] in the Plasma to decrease so that it no longer produces a therapeutic response, causing Seizures to reoccur
- When a drug is administered, it takes around 4/5 t1/2s to reach a steady-state concentration where Plasma [Drug] remains relatively constant
- E.g Amlodipine has a t1/2 of 40 hours so takes around 200 hours to reach a Steady State [ ], meaning it must be taken consistently for 8-9 Days for this steady state [ ] within the Therapeutic Range to be established so that the maximum therapeutic effect of Amlodipine can be taken
- Therefore, Drugs that alter the Metabolism of another drug will alter the t1/2 of another drug and hence, the time it takes to reach a Steady State [ ] of the Other Drug that is within the Therapeutic Range and hence, producing consistent therapeutic effects
- Some drug interactions are beneficial (E.g Inhibiting Metabolism to decrease Drug Dosage required to reach Therapeutic [Drug]), to the extent that more than one pill will contain more than one drug (Fixed-Dose Combinations) to ensure that the drugs are taken at the same time so that the beneficial drug interactions can be seen consistently

# Therapeutic Areas - Unhelpful PD Interactions

- Using vasodilators and vasoconstrictors together (e.g. Vasoconstrictors taken for migraine will be less effective if patient is taking a Vasodilator like GTN as the two effects of the drugs oppose one another).
- Giving drugs that cause fluid retention (or actual fluids) such as Amlodipine and diuretics together as the net result will be no net loss of water/fluid from the Body.
- Using different types of sedatives together.

### Examples

| Drug A | Drug B | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Salbutamol for Asthma | Propranolol | Non-selective ùõΩ adrenoceptor
antagonist (propranolol) will ‚Üì effect of salbutamol (ùõΩ2 adrenoceptor agonist for asthma). |
| Digoxin | Furosemide | Diuretics reduce plasma K‚Å∫ and potentiate the action of cardiac glycosides (Digoxin) as it competes with K‚Å∫ for Na‚Å∫/K‚Å∫ ATPase so when there is K‚Å∫ present, there is greater antagonism of the Na‚Å∫/K‚Å∫ ATPase by Digoxin due to reduced competition by K‚Å∫. |
| Warfarin ‚Üí Inhibits Œ≥ Carboxylation of Vitamin K-Dependent Clotting Factors (Factor VII, IX and X) to Inhibit the Extrinsic Coagulation Cascade | Aspirin ‚Üí N-Acetylates a Serine Residue within the Active Site of COX within Platelets to irreversibly inhibit it | Aspirin inhibits platelet function and potentiates the effect of warfarin which reduces blood clot formation by preventing Primary Haemostasis and Secondary Haemostasis via the Extrinsic Coagulation Cascade, significantly reducing the ability of the Blood to Clot (Increased Risk of GI Bleeds). |
| Benzodiazepines | Alcohol | Can cause Respiratory Depression as both Alcohol and BDZs act as Positive Allosteric Modulators of GABA at the GABA-A Receptor |
| NSAIDs | Diuretics | NSAIDs inhibit the production of PGE2 within the Kidneys, which can inhibit the action of Diuretics |
- As Platelets are Anucleate and hence, cannot synthesise new COX Enzymes to replace those that are irreversibly inhibited, There is reduced production of Prostaglandins and hence, Thromboxane A2 for the duration of the Lifetime of the Platelet (7-10 Days)How can Warfarin and Aspirin interact with one another?

# Therapeutic Areas - Helpful PD Interactions

- Combination antibiotics (e.g. antituberculous drugs).
- Combination antiviral drugs (e.g. anti-HIV).
- Combination chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. drugs that inhibit DNA synthesis in combination with spindle blockers).
- Combination antihypertensive agents.
- These four combinations above are used to prevent the development of Rx Resistance or to increase the therapeutic effects of the drugs by producing therapeutic effects by targeting many different stages in the development of the pathology or many different pathways/mechanism which may contribute to the pathology
- Limiting toxic effects of drugs by giving drugs which produce effects that oppose the toxic side effects (e.g. Giving Laxatives alongside Opiates to prevent Opiate-induced constipation).

### Useful Fixed-Dose Combinations

- L-Dopa and Benserazide.
- Penicillin and Clavulanic acid.
- Anti-tuberculous therapy.

# Pharmacokinetic Interactions

### Absorption

**Gastric Emptying**

- Metoclopramide = Anti-emetic which increases gastric emptying into the Small Intestines and therefore, increases the absorption of Paracetamol as Paracetamol is absorbed across the SI but not the Stomach.

**Drug Binding**

- Charcoal: reduces absorption of many drugs by chelating the drugs so that they cannot be absorbed, which is very effective in the Rx of Overdoses (e.g. paracetamol OD).
- Cholestyramine used to Rx Pruritis seen in Cholestasis - As well as binding to Bile Salts, it binds to warfarin and hence, reduces the absorption of warfarin.
- Ca¬≤‚Å∫ containing foods - Tetracycline forms large complexes with Metallic Cations which causes its absorption to be delayed.

**Distribution**

- Many Drugs are found in the Circulation bound to Plasma Proteins, notably Albumin (E.g Phenytoin) and therefore, the administration of another drug which binds to the same Plasma Protein can displace the original drug, causing its Free Plasma [ ] to increase

### Metabolism

**Cytochrome P450**

- Enzyme system of Mixed Function Oxidases found predominantly in the Liver (but also to a lesser extent in the Kidneys and Brain) which is responsible for the Hepatic Metabolism and Inactivation of a large number of drugs.
- In Phase I Metabolism, Oxidation (by P450 Enzymes) alongside other reactions such as Hydrolysis and Reduction can lead to the formation of Active, Inactive or Toxic Metabolites
- In Phase II Metabolism, Metabolites are conjugated with Gluconate, Acetate or Sulphate so that they become soluble and can be excreted in the Urine or Bile

### Cytochrome P450 Interactions

| Inhibitors | Inducers |
| --- | --- |
| Macrolides (Erythromycin) | Phenytoin |
| Cimetidine | Carbamazepine |
| Ciprofloxacin | Phenobarbitone |
| Isoniazid | Rifampicin |
| Sodium Valproate | Ketoconazole |
| Verapamil | Griseofulvin |
| Grapejuice Juice | Smoking |
|  | Alcohol |
- The Majority of Enzyme Inducers are Anticonvulsant Drugs
- Acronym for Inducers = **CRAP GPS** (Carbemazepines, Rifampicin, Alcohol - Chronic, Phenytoin, Griseofulvin, Phenobarbitone and Sulphonylureas)
- Acronym for Inhibitors = **SICKFACES.COM** (Sodium Valproate, Isoniazid, Cimetidine, Ketoconazole, Fluconazole, Alcohol - Binge Drinking, Chloramphenicol, Erythromycin, Sulfonamides, Ciprofloxacin, Omeprazole, Metronidazole and Grapefruit Juice)

### Excretion

- Not very important clinically.
- Competition of Protein binding between 2 drugs (theoretical).
- Tubular secretion (not very important clinically)
- E.g Probenecid and Penicillins
- Glomerular filtration rate: drugs causing kidney failure can determine excretion of other drugs, which can cause Drugs that are not significantly metabolised before excretion (E.g Digoxin) to accumulate within the Blood, increasing their t1/2.
- Urine pH
- Example: Alkaline urine increases the rate of aspirin excretion (As Aspirin is acidic).

# Adverse Drug Reactions

- Problem drugs: those with narrow therapeutic range.
- Newly licensed drugs need specific monitoring following licensing to identify potential ADRs.
- Problem prescribers without withdrawing a drug if there is an ADR
- Problem patients who are more susceptible to ADRs:
1. Elderly (Reduced Drug Metabolism and Excretion)
2. Polypharmacy (Increasing Risk of Drug-Drug Interactions)
3. Liver or kidney disease (Reduced Drug Metabolism).
4. Women of child-bearing potential as some drugs can be Teratogenic.

| Type of Reaction | Mechanism | Treatment | Mortality |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A - Dose-Related | Pharmacological Action of Drug | Reduce or Withhold Dose | Low |
| B - Not Dose Related (Risk However tends to increase as the Dosage increases in Size) | Immunological or Idiosyncratic | Withhold and Avoid in the Future | High |
| C - Cumulative Dose | Pharmacological Action of Drug Over Time | Reduce Dose or Withhold For Prolonged Duration | Low |

# Types of ADRs

### Type A Reactions:

- Predictable:
1. ùõΩ-blockers in asthma
2. Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channel blockers and constipation
3. Aspirin and dyspepsia.

### Type B Reactions:

- Unpredictable:
1. Penicillins and anaphylaxis.

# Drug Development and ADRs

### Drug Development - Detecting ADRs (Adverse Drug Reactions)

- Small numbers of patients in phase 1-3 trials (~ 4,000).
- Usually given to younger individuals than in clinical practice.
- Patients in clinical trials are unrepresentative of patients in general because of exclusion criteria:
1. Co-morbidity
2. Polypharmacy
3. Women of child-bearing potential.
4. Children

### How are ADRs Discovered?

- Clinical trials:
1. Generally, too small to detect uncommon ADRs.
2. If detected, usually stops development.
- Case reports: thalidomide.
- Post marketing surveillance (yellow card scheme following introduction of a new drug to identify Unexpected ADRs): methotrexate and liver disease.
