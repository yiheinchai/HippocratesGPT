- Therapies:
1. Reduce Excitatory and Increase Inhibitory Output

### Drugs

- Benzodiazepine → Increase GABA-A Potency by binding between Alpha and Gamma subunit
- Increase frequency of GABA-A Channel opening to mediate increased Cl- Influx
- Inverse Agonist = Negative Allosteric Modulator (Flumezanil)
- Beta-Carboline = Negative Allosteric Modulator of GABA-A
- Flumazenil does not impact the GABA-A Curve when no Positive Allosteric Modulator is present
- Barbiturates bind to both Synaptic and Extrasynaptic Receptors which are responsible for Synaptic GABA Transmission and Long Term Tonic GABAergic Transmission to modulate cerebral activity and prevent hyperexcitability during instances of Non-Synaptic Activity
- Barbiturates increase the duration that the GABA-A Receptor is open for whilst Benzodiazepines increase the frequency of GABA-A Channel Opening

# Uses of Benzodiazepines

- Based on duration of action

---

# Case Study

- 70, alone → Takes Benzo (Nitrazepam) to help sleep
- Increased Insomnia, Walks around at night, confusion, forgetful, sleeps a lot
- Use Chlormethiazole instead of BDZ for the elderly

# Anti-Epileptics

- Vaproate → Blocks GABA Metabolism
- Tiagabine → Blocks GABA Reuptake
