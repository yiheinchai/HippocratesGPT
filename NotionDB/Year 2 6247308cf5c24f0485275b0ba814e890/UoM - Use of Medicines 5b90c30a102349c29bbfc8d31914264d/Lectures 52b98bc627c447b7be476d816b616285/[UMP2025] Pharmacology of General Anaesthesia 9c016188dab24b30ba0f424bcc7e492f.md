# [UMP2025] Pharmacology of General Anaesthesia

# History of Anaesthetics

- An *analgesic* effect of nitrous oxide (which occurs prior to general anaesthesia for this agent) was known to Priestley (1776) and Davy (1796)
- The soporific (cause drowsiness) and analgesic effects of ether were know to Faraday (1816).
- However, the first recorded practitioner of modern general anaesthesia was a US country doctor called Crawford Long.
- Today, they are in ubiquitous clinical use, in dentistry, surgery and intensive care.
- General anaesthetics are very safe drugs despite having only a narrow safety margin (a therapeutic index, ED50/LD50 or ratio of Effective and Lethal Dosage of ~2-4), because their administration (Concentration of the Drug) is very carefully controlled by highly trained anaesthetists who use an array of equipment to administer to, and then monitor, their patients.
- They are often coadministered with other agent such as Muscle Relaxants

# General Anaesthesia

- General anaesthesia is often defined as “a drug-induced reversible loss of consciousness”.
- The anaesthetic state shows some similarities, and some differences, between the brain during deep non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep.
- The extent of any connection has yet to be clearly established
- Despite acting on the CNS, they have relatively smaller effects on the CNS, Cardiovascular and Respiratory System
- Levels of Anaesthesia is usually determined via Proxy Measures by a lack of response to a painful stimulus (Surgical Anaesthesia) or a lack of Righting Reflex where the Subject is unable to restore their upright/normal posture when they are knocked over (Experimental Anaesthesia).

# Anaesthetic Potency and Quantal Responses

### Measuring Anaesthesia in Research

- In experiments measuring anaesthesia, each individual is often classified as either anaesthetised or not
- Because only discrete states are recognised (anaesthetised or conscious) and there are no graded values, such responses are said to be ‘quantal’ in nature.
- The relative effectiveness of general anaesthetics is often compared by a measure called the ED50.
- The ED50 is the dose (or concentration) that is effective/produced desired effects in 50% of the population being tested (Dose at which 50% of Individuals have a tolerance less than this)
- Anaesthetic Potency is defined as the reciprocal of the ED50 (1/ED50), i.e. when you need a lot of drug (a high concentration) to achieve anaesthesia, this drug is thought of as being not very potent.
- Conversely, if you need a small amount of drug (or a low concentration) the agent is said to be very potent.

# General Anaesthetic Classes

- General anaesthetics are usually split into two classes of agents; the intravenous agents and the inhalational agents.
- These are absorbed through the lungs and are usually gases or volatile liquids
- The ones most commonly used as Desflurane, Isoflurane and Sevoflurate (often combined with Nitrous Oxide due to its Analgesic Effects)
- This method of administration (breathing them in) makes it possible to very precisely control the concentration of anaesthetic administered and absorbed by the Px by altering the partial pressure of the anaesthetic agent in the inhaled mixture
- This is one of the reasons anaesthesia is relatively safe, despite the narrow safety margin.
- However, for some of the inhalational agents, it takes quite a time for individuals to reach unconsciousness as they take a long time to equilibriate with the blood.
- This is not so helpful, especially if patients are nervous.
- This problem led to the development of intravenous agents.
- Intravenous agents were developed to render the patient unconscious quickly and so are used for the induction of Anaesthesia.
- These include Thiopentone, Propofol and Etomidate
- Although they induce anaesthesia rapidly, it is often more difficult to control their concentration within the body so they have not, traditionally, been used to maintain anaesthesia.

# Anaesthetic Structure

- There is a vast degree of diversity in the structures of Anaesthetic agents, which seemingly contradicted the Lock and Key theory of Pharmacodynamics (Drugs of Specific Structures interacted with Receptors of Specific Structures) and hence, made it difficult to identify their specific mechanism of action and targets

---

# Meyer-Overton Hypothesis

- Meyer and Overton discovered that the anaesthetic potency of these agents was positively correlated with the agent’s Oil:Water partition coefficient/Lipid Solubility
- This led to the idea that anaesthetic agents dissolved in lipid membranes, disrupted the lipid structure and hence rendered proteins in the cell membrane non-functional to produce Anaesthesia - This is false.

# Anaesthetic Action (Franks and Lieb)

- Anaesthetics act by binding to Hydrophobic Domains within proteins to alter their activity (prevent substrates from binding), despite their varying structures
- Franks and Lieb studied anaesthetic inhibition of an enzyme, firefly luciferase, the enzyme that is responsible for producing light in the tail of the firefly.
- Franks and Lieb were able to show that anaesthetics could compete with luciferin for binding to a hydrophobic pocket on the enzyme, even though the structures of the anaesthetic molecules were diverse, and quite different to luciferin.
- This is because small, flexible anaesthetic molecules could occupy the luciferin binding pocket and still make hydrophobic interactions because such interactions do not have many constraints imposed by structure/orientation.
- This demonstrated that Anaesthetics interact with specific CNS Receptors

---

# Mechanisms of Action

- Intravenous Agents are mainly used for rapid induction of Anaesthesia and Inhalational Agents are used to maintain anaesthesia during long operations

---

# Mechanisms of Actions of Intravenous Agents Propofol, Etomidate and Thiopentone

- Intravenous agents like etomidate, propofol and thiopentone act as Positive Modulators to enhance the activity of GABA at the GABA-A Receptor.
- There are four key lines of evidence supporting this argument.
1. All three agents strongly enhance the activity of and hence, currents produced by GABA-A receptors at relatively low, and hence clinically concentrations (as High [Anaesthetic] commonly causes further effects which cause death).
- This suppresses the activity of the CNS to produce anaesthesia
1. For Etomidate the enhancement of GABA-A activity is stereoselective i.e. R+ and S– isomers have different potencies, despite identical lipid solubility (which hence contradicted the Lipid Bilayer Mechanism of Action Theory). 
- For Etomidate, R(+) Etomidate is around 5-10x more potent than S(-) Etomidate

1. It has been shown that a mutation in the b3 subunit of the GABA-A receptor (b3 N265M) makes can reduce the ability of general anaesthetics to enhance the activity of GABA-A receptors containing this subunit by reducing the sensitivity of GABA-A to IV Anaesthetics
- A knock-in experiment, in which mice were engineered to replace the wild-type receptor with this N265M variant produces mice with less sensitivity to both propofol and etomidate anaesthesia.
- This therefore means that mutations to GABA-A Alter the ability of the IV Anaesthetic to produce Anaesthesia

![Screenshot 2022-01-12 at 19.40.34.png](%5BUMP2025%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20General%20Anaesthesia%209c016188dab24b30ba0f424bcc7e492f/Screenshot_2022-01-12_at_19.40.34.png)

1. Ortho-propofol diazirine is a photo reactive analogue of propofol, which has been shown, in structural studies, to bind the GABA-A receptor and enhance its activity to produce anaesthesia. 
- This shows that Propofol and Etomidate act on the GABA-A Receptor directly (Not indirectly by activating Secondary Messengers that act on GABA-A)

# Which GABA-A Receptors do Intravenous Anaesthetics Target?

- Both synaptic and extrasynaptic (tonic inhibition) GABA currents
are affected by IV Anaesthetics at Clinical Doses.
- Synaptic GABAA currents, typically mediated by α1–3β2/3γ2, tend to show less enhancement than extrasynaptic GABA-A currents (which usually arise from α4–6 (α4βxδ, α5βxγ2 and α6βxδ).
- However, the relative contributions of tonic (extrasynaptic) and phasic (synaptic) activity in vivo remains to be established.

---

# Mechanism of Action for Volatile Agents Halothane, Enflurane and Isoflurane

- Inhalational anaesthetics are able to enhance GABA-A receptor activity at clinically relevant concentrations.
- However, their efficacy is less than Intravenous Agents and their mechanism of action is much less certain, likely targetting multiple proteins (notably Cys-Loop Receptors)
- All three of these agents are also able to enhance the activity of glycine receptors at clinically relevant concentrations which contribute to CNS Inhibition

![Untitled](%5BUMP2025%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20General%20Anaesthesia%209c016188dab24b30ba0f424bcc7e492f/Untitled%202.png)

- At Clinically Significant [ ], they can activate/open TREK-1, TASK-1 and TASK-3 K⁺ channels to hyperpolarise and inhibit CNS neurons to produce Anaesthesia
- TASK-3 Knock-Out Experiments in Mice leads to a reduced sensitivity to Volatile Anaesthetics like halothane (higher dosage is needed to produce Anaesthesia), but it produces no change in the sensitivity of the animals when challenged with Cyclopropane, which does not activate the TASK-3 channels but still produces anaesthesia.
- Thus, there remain other anaesthetic-sensitive targets (which may include e.g. TREK-1 channels, GABA-A and glycine receptors) which can produce anaesthesia.

![Untitled](%5BUMP2025%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20General%20Anaesthesia%209c016188dab24b30ba0f424bcc7e492f/Untitled%203.png)

# Nitrous Oxide, Cyclopropane and Xenon

- These do not activate GABA-A but activate TREK-1 at clinically relevant concentrations.
- Xenon has a low blood solubility, which means that anaesthesia can be induced rapidly as it can quickly reach the brain
- Unlike other anaesthetics, it also lacks vasodilatation effects
- It also has a low toxicity and may protect neuronal cells against ischemic injury
- The cost and limited availability of this gas is likely why it is not commonly used
- Xenon and Nitrous Oxide can stimulate TREK-1 Channels and inhibit NMDA receptors at clinically relevant concentrations, by competing for binding at the glycine/serine binding site.

---

# Ketamine

- Ketamine may also target NMDA receptors where it acts as a channel pore blocker (This may account for its neuroprotective effects)
- Ketamine produces profound ‘dissociative anaesthesia’ so that in addition to analgesia there is marked sensory loss, amnesia/light sleep, dissociaton from surroundings and paralysis, but without a full loss of consciousness.
- As it causes incomplete anaesthesia, it can be used when low levels of consciousness are required (allows Px to be cooperative and acutely aware during surgery)

### Advantages

1. It is a good analgesic
2. Lethal overdose is rare so it can be used in environments where tight regulation of [Ketamine] is not possible
3. It is orally active so can be used orally as an analgesic

### Disadvantage

1. Recovery is slow
2. It can produce Hallucinations (Less so in children and hence, is commonly used in Paediatric Surgery and as a Paediatric Sedative after trauma
3. It is widely used in Veterinary Practice
4. It is widely abused and can cause bladder damage with Chronic Use

# Pharmacokinetics for Inhalational Agents

- Inhalational anaesthetics are absorbed and excreted via the lungs.
- Their potency is commonly expressed as the ‘minimum alveolar concentration*’* (MAC) which is the concentration of the anaesthetic in the air that produces a lack of response to painful stimulus in 50% of Px (It is effectively a measure of EC50 expressed as a Concentration in Air vs Blood)

[Untitled](%5BUMP2025%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20General%20Anaesthesia%209c016188dab24b30ba0f424bcc7e492f/Untitled%20Database%2054573caab688407d8e5bdaaf5092cd1a.md)

- If the Potency of a Volatile Anaesthetic is very low, the Safe Anaesthetic Concentration (MAC) may be greater than the maximum possible concentration that can be given at ATP (Greater than ATP), meaning the required amount of the Drug required to produce anaesthesia cannot be given without lowering PiO₂ and causing Hypoxaemia
- For these Anaesthetics, they are not suitable alone for Surgical Anaesthesia but can be used in mixes with other anaesthetics (E.g Analgesia in childbirth at 50% N₂O/Air)
- Factors that influence how quickly the Inhaled Anaesthetic gets to the brain to produce Anaesthesia include:
1. concentration in inspired air
2. rate and depth of breathing
3. permeability of alveolar capillary membrane (usually high)
4. blood flow through lungs (variable)
5. Solubility of drug in blood (= blood/air coefficient, λ)
6. blood flow to brain (usually high)
7. partition coefficient between brain & blood of drug (usually high)
- The blood:air partition coefficient is the concentration in blood, relative to that in the air *at* equilibrium (measure of solubility of the Drug in the Blood).
- MAC x λ = blood concentration at equilibrium.

---

# Rate of Onset and Recovery

- The rate at which anaesthetics reach equilibrium is faster for the less-soluble agents than more soluble agents
- When trying to establishing a steady state concentration of Anaesthesia using an Inhaled Anaesthetic with a High Blood/Gas Partition Coefficient and hence, a low MAC, Anaesthetic diffuses into the Blood so that [Anaesthetic] in the Alveoli drops below MAC.
- When another breath is taken, the [Anaesthetic] in the Alveoli is increased again back to MAC when more Anaesthetic is breathed in
- This creates an Oscillatory Cycle of [Anaesthetic] in the Alveoli, meaning it takes a long time for the [Anaesthetic] in the Blood to equilibriate and reach a steady state due to fluctuations in [Anaesthetic] in the Alveoli, away from that required to produce Anaesthesia

![Screenshot 2022-01-14 at 00.54.46.png](%5BUMP2025%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20General%20Anaesthesia%209c016188dab24b30ba0f424bcc7e492f/Screenshot_2022-01-14_at_00.54.46.png)

- For Inhaled Anaesthetics with a Low Blood:Gas Partition Coefficient and hence, a High MAC, this means that when it is inhaled, it reaches its MAC level in the Alveoli and small amounts of the Nitrous Oxide is able to diffuse into the Blood
- This causes a small drop in [Anaesthetic] within the Alveoli so that it remains around the MAC, close to the [ ] needed to produce Anaesthesia
- This means that this High MAC Drug will equilibriate more quickly

![Screenshot 2022-01-14 at 00.55.13.png](%5BUMP2025%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20General%20Anaesthesia%209c016188dab24b30ba0f424bcc7e492f/Screenshot_2022-01-14_at_00.55.13.png)

- Volatile Anaesthetics are not usually metabolised and hence, are eliminated from the body across the lungs (during Exhalation) in an unmetabolised form
- Therefore as the Blood:Gas Partition Coefficient drops, the Solubility of the Anaesthetic in the blood also drops. This means the drug more readily vaporised from the Blood and hence, can be eliminated during exhalation
- This therefore means that induction and recovery from less soluble Anaesthetics with a High MAC/Low Blood:Gas Partition Coefficient is quicker than that for a Drug with a Low MAC/High Blood:Gas Partition Coefficient
- Ideally, a General Anaesthetic should have a low MAC (High Potency) and a low Blood Solubility (Rapid Onset and Offset) to localise the duration of Anaesthesia to when it is needed and to minimise the dose required for Anaesthesia

![Untitled](%5BUMP2025%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20General%20Anaesthesia%209c016188dab24b30ba0f424bcc7e492f/Untitled%204.png)

### Influence of Blood Supply to Different Tissues

- Cerebral Blood Flow is High so that Equilibrium of the Anaesthetic within the Brain occurs more rapidly than that of other Tissues
- As most anaesthetics are lipid soluble and hence, soluble in fats, a large proportion of Anaesthetic will be localised to body fat at equilibrium
- As the blood flow through fat is slow due to its low blood supply, equilibrium of [Anaesthetic] in fat is very slow, meaning that there is a slower recovery from Anaesthesia in Obese Px and a prolonged Hangover Effect caused by the persistence of Anaesthetics within the Body (within Fat Stores)

---

# Pharmacological Actions and Side Effects

- Apart from the primary effect on the brain that produces unconsciousness, anaesthetics decrease cardiac contractility and most (except ketamine, nitrous oxide and xenon) produce respiratory depression.
- Halothane and other halogenated anaesthetics produce hypotension due to myocardial depression and vasodilatation.
- Although the incidence of serious toxic effects is very low, the therapeutic ratio is quite low for general anaesthetics as a result of their principal actions: the dose may not need to be increased much to move from surgical anaesthesia to respiratory paralysis.
- Use of a mixture of halogenated hydrocarbon with N₂O may minimise vasomotor depression.

### Toxic Effects

- Serious effects are rare.
- Cardiac dysrhythmias can be produced.
- Halothane may rarely (1 in 100,000) cause liver damage, especially with repeated exposure and is rarely used.
- Anaesthetics may also cause nausea and possibly vomiting after recovery.
- Some of these effects may be caused by metabolites.

---

# Pharmacokinetics for Thiopentone

- Agents like thiopentone (Barbiturate) can produce very rapid anaesthesia and has a short duration of action if a single dose is given
- This is because as thiopentone is very lipid soluble, it can cross cell membranes and hence the blood brain barrier, remarkably quickly (causing [ ] in the blood to rapidly fall)
- This causes the concentration in the brain (and other tissues with a large blood supply) to quickly peaks just after the peak in blood concentration is seen after an intravenous injection.
- This peak is, however, quite brief because the drug soon redistributes from the Viscera to other, less well perfused parts of the body (the lean tissues and eventually the body fat due to the High Lipid Solubility of the Drug)
- This fall in blood concentration as a result of anaesthetic redistribution, causes the brain concentration to fall too, and naturally this leads to recovery of consciousness.
- If repeated doses of thiopentone are given the blood, and hence the brain, concentration will remain high, and thiopentone will then be seen to be a quite long-acting, slowly metabolized barbiturate.
- Because of the complications of intravenous anaesthetics, they are normally used only for induction.
- The anaesthetist needs to be able to control the level of anaesthesia from moment to moment, and over long periods of time the best control is often obtained most easily with inhaled anaesthetics.
- The actions of thiopentone produce no analgesic effects (prior to anaesthesia) and respiratory depression can be profound.
- The main hazard in practice is that the thiopentone solution is very alkaline, and it can cause serious tissue damage and pain if the intravenous injection is not done properly

# Propofol

- Given the disadvantages of thiopentone, propofol (and sometimes Etomidate) is often instead for induction and increasingly, it is used for short procedures without the need of inhalational anaesthetics for maintenance (Total Intravenous Anaesthesia/TIVA) due to its rapid metabolism and lack of accumulation within the body (improves recovery).
- Propofol is commonly used in TIVA where it is administered by a slow, continuous infusion that is computer controlled to minimise the risk of overdose
- As it needs to be given IV, there is little potential for Propofol abuse
- Propofol itself is metabolized quickly, enabling a fast recovery with no hangover effect due to persistence of the drug in the body but it can cause pain/irritation at the site of injection.
- This disadvantage has prompted two further developments in drug research.
- First, the formulation of propofol has been adjusted to try to prevent discomfort on injection. (An approach that has been partially successful.)
- Secondly, propofol derivatives have been created to reduce pain on injection.
- The most promising of these is fospropofol, a prodrug that is converted to propofol in the body and hence, produces less pain at the site of injection.
