# [UMP2007] Clinical Pharmacology of Hypertension

# How Big is the Problem?

- Hypertension is most prevalent modifiable risk factor for IHD, stroke, CKD, CCF and PVD  worldwide.
- 45-50% of strokes and MI’s can be attributed to hypertension
worldwide.
- Accounts for > 10 million deaths worldwide per year.
- Major cause of end-stage renal failure.
- As BP Increases (and age increases), risk of mortality from Stroke and IHD increases (more pronounced for Stroke than IHD)

---

# Why is it a Problem?

- **Eye**: hypertensive retinopathy
- **Brain**: Ischaemic and Haemorrhagic stroke, small vessel disease (dementia)
- **Heart**: Atherosclerosis, Heart Failure, Ischaemic Heart Disease
- **Kidney**: end-stage renal disease
- Hypertension is often found alongside other risk factors for these conditions (Diabetes, Hyperlipidaemia etc.), which are additive to significantly increase risks of developing these conditions

# What is Hypertension?

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 21.50.01.png](%5BUMP2007%5D%20Clinical%20Pharmacology%20of%20Hypertension%20ddbcce6e5bbf4eb48fdf0efdc83f327f/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_21.50.01.png)

- Systolic of 140/90 mmHg
- Positively Skewed Normal Distribution of BP across the population

---

# How should we measure BP?

1. **Clinic measurements**: used in all major drug trials in hypertension, but BP can be highly variable and subject to White Coat Phenomenon.
- BP drops if measured more than once therefore, you should re-measure BP more than once if the initial BP is high, until there is a non-significant change in BP between consecutive measurements

### Other Measurements

1. **Unattended Office BP** - Px left alone in a room and an automated BP Cuff measures BP 2/3 times (This tends to be a more accurate measurement of BP)
2. **Home BP Monitoring (HBPM)** - Px given automated BP Cuff and takes regular measurements at home and records these
- By Px recording their own results (usually in the morning and evening), they can see for themselves their BP and hence, can improve Medication Adherennce
1. **Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM)**:
- Px wears BP Cuff for 24 Hours, which intermittently takes their BP throughout the day and overnight
- May be better predictor of cardiovascular risk.
- Gives far more information.
- Very useful in certain contexts (e.g. apparent resistant hypertension such as White Coat Syndrome) to investigate white coat hypertension.
- Guidelines differ on how it should be used: NICE (ABPM to confirm Hypertension if 2/3 clinic BPs > 140/90 mmHg AKA if Hypertensive in Clinic) - Gold Standard for Hypertension Dx

### White Coat Hypertension

- Observed in 30% of patients with a clinic BP > 140/90 mmHg.
- Prognosis of these patients is better with those who sustained hypertension (in most studies).
- Whether or not patient with WCH should be treated with antihypertensives is controversial due to conflicting data on associated risks.
- ABPM used to distinguish Sustained Hypertension from WCH

# Causes

### Essential (Idiopathic) - Most Common

- Age (Strongest Risk Factor - Calcification of Vessels increases TPR)
- Genetic/Familial
- Overweight
- Alcohol
- Salt intake
- Sedentary lifestyle

### Secondary - Less Common

- Coarctation of the Aorta
- Renovascular Disease: Decrease in blood flow to kidney due to blockage (Atherosclerosis), so mechanisms try to ↑ BP to increase blood flow (RAAS Activation).
- Renal parenchymal Disease
- Endocrine:
1. Conn’s/Primary aldosteronism - Increased Aldosterone Increases Na⁺ Retention by the Kidneys → ECV and SV Increase
2. Phaeochromocytoma
3. Cushing's Syndrome - Increased Cortisol stimulates Renal Mineralocorticoid Receptors, Increasing Na⁺ Retention by the Kidneys → ECV and SV Increase
- Drugs (E.g Cocaine)
- CKD increases TPR, SV and HR so is a significant cause of Hypertension

# Who to Screen?

- Screening is only done in Px in which there is a high suspicious of Hypertension
1. Patients with ‘resistant’ hypertension (BP > 140/90 mmHg on 3 antihypertensives).
2. Young patients (< 40) with high blood pressure 
3. Patients presenting with severe hypertension (> 180/110 mmHg).
- These groups of individuals have a higher prevalence of underlying Secondary Cause
- **Hypertensive urgency**: High blood pressure (>180/120 mmHg - Grade 3) that needs to come down, but body is coping with it (no target end organ damage)
- **Hypertensive emergency**: high blood pressure (180/120 mmHg - Grade 3 ) that needs to come down, and is causing target end organ damage (aortic dissection, stroke, swelling at back of eye, ↑ ICP).

---

# Screen for Secondary Causes

- **History**:
1. Childhood renal disease(UTI)
2. family history
3. Drug Use (NSAID, steroid, illicit, COCP/Contraceptive Pill (HRT, POP).
- **Exam**:
1. Radio-Femoral delay (Coarctation of Aorta)
2. Renal bruit (turbulence in what you can hear in a vessel, can be caused by partial obstruction by an Atherosclerotic Plaque/Renal Artery Stenosis
3. Evidence of arterial disease (Check Pulses bilaterally)
- **Bedside/clinic**:
1. Urinalysis
- **Laboratory**:
1. K⁺ (Might be low Conn's or if too high, might contraindicate K⁺ Sparing Diuretics)
2. Creatinine

# Who to Treat?

1. **Secondary cause**:
- Or presented with accelerated hypertension
- Treat by addressing underlying cause of Secondary Hypertension
1. **Present with Severe Hypertension** (>180/120 mmHg - Grade 3)
2. **Essential hypertension**:
- Treat if BP > 160/100 mmHg
- Consider treatment if > 140/90 mmHg and they are
1. High risk of CVD
2. Have Target-organ damage due to Hypertension
- Low Risk Hypertensive individuals are under represented in Clinical Trials and therefore, there is a lack of evidence showing the efficacy of treating Low Risk individuals with Hypertension

---

# High Risk Groups

1. **Secondary prevention (**This is when someone has already had the outcome once.) 
- E.g Pre-existing cardiovascular disease (including cerebrovascular, IHD, PVD).
1. **Other cardiovascular risk factors**:
- Diabetes mellitus (DM)
- Established CKD (chronic kidney disease)
1. **10-year cardiovascular risk**
- If Px 10-Year Cardiovascular Risk >10% (NICE) or 20% depending on guidelines, treat them

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 23.02.56.png](%5BUMP2007%5D%20Clinical%20Pharmacology%20of%20Hypertension%20ddbcce6e5bbf4eb48fdf0efdc83f327f/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_23.02.56.png)

- **Target Organ Damage (Most Commonly if Px has LVH or Reduced Renal Function)**

---

# Who Should Our Target Be?

- **SPRINT trial**: Those with increased cardiovascular risk (excluded diabetes and stroke patients).
- Lowering BP to a significantly lower level than the standard target level does ↓ the incidence of other outcomes/clinical events but has ↑ side effects from antihypertensives.
- Summary - Target should be <140/80 mmHg but lower if well tolerated and more relaxed target in frail/elderly Px to minimise clinical effects associated with Hypotensive effects

---

# What Should We Treat With?

### NICE 2019 Guidelines

- Reduce Clinic BP to <140/90 mmHg < 80 years old or >150/90 mmHg > 80 years old (Higher as Elderly individuals are at a greater risk of adverse effects associated with Hypotension)

### ESC Guidelines

1. Lower to <140/90 mmHg
2. If Rx is well tolerated (Few Side Effects), aim for <130/80 mmHg
3. In Px < 65, lower BP to 120-129 and in Px > 65, keep it to 130-139 BP

### How to Treat?

- **Non-pharmacological**: Modify lifestyle such as diet (lower salt, alcohol etc.), exercise
- This usually cannot treat the Hypertension alone and usually require Pharmacological Managements
- **Pharmacological management**:
- Drugs from 3 major drug classes are used first-line.
1. **A**: ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers.
2. **B**: β-blockers (Not first line)
- **C**: Ca²⁺ channel blockers (dihydropyridines - others aren't first line as less vasospecific).
1. **D**: Diuretics (Thiazide/Thiazide-like and K⁺ sparing).
- **Other classes**: α-blockers, centrally acting (4th Line for those who are resistant to the A,C,D Drugs)

---

# Drugs used to Treat Hypertension

### ACE Inhibitors/Angiontensin II Blockers

- **ACE inhibitors**: rami**pril**, lisinopril, perindopril, enalapril
- **Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)**: los**artan**, irbesartan, valsartan, candesartan
- ACE Inhibitors and ARBs are often used interchangeably and have similar side effects

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 23.07.24.png](%5BUMP2007%5D%20Clinical%20Pharmacology%20of%20Hypertension%20ddbcce6e5bbf4eb48fdf0efdc83f327f/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_23.07.24.png)

**Cautions/Side Effects**

1. Hyperkalaemia
2. Angioedema - More common in ACE Inhibitors than ARBs, notably in those who are Black (Due to Bradykinin Accumulation)
3. Renal impairment (especially if acute kidney injury)
4. Cough (ACE Inhibitors more than ARBs) 

### β-Blockers

- Predominantly β1 Blockers to reduce HR, SV and Renin Release from the Heart and Kidneys respectively
- 4th Line Drugs in the treatment of Hypertension

[β-Blockers](%5BUMP2007%5D%20Clinical%20Pharmacology%20of%20Hypertension%20ddbcce6e5bbf4eb48fdf0efdc83f327f/%CE%B2-Blockers%20fdc676b4397143f3a201452d4d78f633.md)

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 23.11.50.png](%5BUMP2007%5D%20Clinical%20Pharmacology%20of%20Hypertension%20ddbcce6e5bbf4eb48fdf0efdc83f327f/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_23.11.50.png)

### Cautions/Side Effects

1. Bradycardia/AV block
2. Asthma/COPD (Cardioselective β1 Blockers may be used in COPD under specialist supervision due to risk of Bronchoconstriction due to β2 Antagonism).
3. Uncontrolled heart failure - Reduced Inotropy can exacerbate Heart Failure

### Ca²⁺ Channel Blockers

- Slow down firing of the SAN and AVN by reducing Ca²⁺ entry into Nodal Cells

[Ca²⁺ Channel Blockers](%5BUMP2007%5D%20Clinical%20Pharmacology%20of%20Hypertension%20ddbcce6e5bbf4eb48fdf0efdc83f327f/Ca%C2%B2%E2%81%BA%20Channel%20Blockers%20ab62474ff0f243dbb27746755dd48156.md)

### Cautions/Side Effects

1. Headache (due to vasodilation)
2. Tachycardia (reflex activation of SNS via Baroreceptors - can be reduced by using a different class of CCB or a β-blocker)
3. Ankle swelling
4. Bradycardia with rate-limiting CCBs
- **Verapamil**: most -ve inotropic CCB and so, it may precipitate heart failure.

[Diuretics](%5BUMP2007%5D%20Clinical%20Pharmacology%20of%20Hypertension%20ddbcce6e5bbf4eb48fdf0efdc83f327f/Diuretics%20e1f1bb9ded0a445eaf535c6fb1a781d3.md)

- Thiazides are the most commonly used diuretic in Hypertension
- Loop Diuretics are not usually used to treat Hypertension as they are too potent and produce pronounced Hypovolaemia (Usually restricted to Heart Failure and Chronic Kidney Disease)
- Thiazide and Loop Diuretic Usage increases Na⁺ Delivery to the CCD, increasing K⁺ Secretion (Via Na⁺/K⁺ Exchanger), causing Hypokalaemia
- NICE - As K⁺ Sparing Diuretics (E.g Spironolactone) reduce K⁺ loss, they should not be used in Hyperkalaemic Px with [K⁺] > 4.5 mM (E.g Chronic Kidney Disease Px)

![Screenshot 2021-10-29 at 07.58.28.png](%5BUMP2007%5D%20Clinical%20Pharmacology%20of%20Hypertension%20ddbcce6e5bbf4eb48fdf0efdc83f327f/Screenshot_2021-10-29_at_07.58.28.png)

### Cautions/Side Effects of Thiazides:

1. Hypokalaemia
2. Hypercalcaemia
3. Hyponatraemia (Significant in Elderly Individuals)
4. Gout
5. Alkalosis

### Drug Mechanisms

# Which Drug to Use?

1. Px < 55 with Hypertension, use ACE Inhibitor or ARB
2. Px > 55 or Black People with African/Caribbean origin (Any Age), use CCB
3. If unresponsive, Try ACE-I/ARB + CCB
4. If unresponsive, Try ACE-I/ARB + CCB + Thiazide-Like Diuretic
5. If unresponsive (Resistant Hypertension), consider using Spironolactone if K⁺ is normal or α/β Blocker Blocker if Px is Hyperkalaemic (And refer to Secondary Screening Clinic)

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 23.23.14.png](%5BUMP2007%5D%20Clinical%20Pharmacology%20of%20Hypertension%20ddbcce6e5bbf4eb48fdf0efdc83f327f/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_23.23.14.png)

![Screenshot 2021-10-29 at 12.52.49.png](%5BUMP2007%5D%20Clinical%20Pharmacology%20of%20Hypertension%20ddbcce6e5bbf4eb48fdf0efdc83f327f/Screenshot_2021-10-29_at_12.52.49.png)

# What is this Advice Based on?

1. Age
- Renin secretion is suppressed with age and therefore becomes a less significant driver of Hypertension with age.
- Therefore, treatments which target effect of renin (ACE/ARB/𝛽-blocker) are thought to be less
effective in elderly individuals.
1. Ethnicity
- Prevalence of ↑ BP greater in those of African origin.
- Lower levels of plasma renin activity (Less RAAS Driven) and more driven by mutations affecting salt and water reabsorption (salt-sensitive hypertension).
- ACE side-effects more common.
- Some agents (E.g ACE-I or ARBs) less effective.
- CCBs are most significant at reducing Stroke Risk and hence, should be used if Px has had/is at increased risk of Stroke

### ESC Algorithm

1. ACEi/ARB + CCB/Diuretic
2. ACEi/ARB + CCB + Diuretic
3. Resistant Hypertension (Add Spironolactone, Other Diuretic or α/β Blocker
- This use of 2 vs 1 drug initially allows for 2 Hypertensive Pathways to be blocked straight away to minimise compensation that can produce side-effects to allow for a more rapid and sustained control of BP
- Spironolactone is preferred 4th Line Drug as it produces the most significant drop in Blood Pressure compared to α/β Blockers

---

# Summary

1. Who to Treat
- Anyone with BP > 160/100 mmHg.
- Anyone with prior CV event (secondary prevention).
- Anyone with BP > 140/90 mmHg who is high-risk (use Qrisk calculator).
- Anyone with secondary cause of presented with accelerated hypertension.
1. What to treat with
- Diet and lifestyle for all: preach hard, expect little.
- Once checked contraindications, follow NICE approach.
1. What treatment target?
- Lower is better if can achieve without symptoms and address all other risk factors (e.g. diabetes, lipids, smoking).
