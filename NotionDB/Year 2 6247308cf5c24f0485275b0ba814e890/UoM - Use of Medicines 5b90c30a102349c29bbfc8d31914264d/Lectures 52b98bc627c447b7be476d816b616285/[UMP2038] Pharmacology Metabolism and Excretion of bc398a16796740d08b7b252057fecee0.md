# [UMP2038] Pharmacology: Metabolism and Excretion of Drugs

# Drug Distribution

- Reversible transfer of a drug from 1 location to another within body.
- Once a drug has entered vascular system, it becomes distributed throughout various tissues and body fluids in a pattern that reflects physiochemical nature of drug and ease with which it penetrates different membranes.
- Factors determining drug distribution to a tissue:
1. Carriage within blood stream (E.g Binding to Tissue Proteins).
2. Cardiac Output and Local Tissue Perfusion
3. Passage out of blood stream into tissue (determined by membrane permeability via gaps between the cells/paracellular transport).
4. Particular affinity of drugs for tissue components.

---

# Drug Distribution Patterns

1. Drug remains largely within vascular system: plasma substitutes.
- Example: dextran, heparin. Strongly bind to plasma proteins.
- This is seen if the Drug has a High Mr or is extensively bound to plasma proteins
1. Low molecular weight, soluble compounds are uniformly distributed throughout body water:
- Example: ethanol, sulfonamides.
1. Specific concentrations in 1 or more tissues (may or may not be site of action).
- Example: iodine (thyroid gland), chloroquine (liver), tetracycline (developing bones and teeth), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB, fat tissue).
1. Non-uniform distribution based on lipid/water solubility of drug and its ability to pass through membranes: anything that can’t be classified in above 3 categories. High concentrations in kidney, liver and intestine.

---

# Volume of Distribution

- Volume of distribution or apparent volume of distribution.
- Volume of distribution: volume that would be necessary to contain the total amount of an administered drug at the same concentration that it is observed in the plasma OR volume of fluid that drug dose would occupy if it were evenly distributed in that volume at the same [ ] as that measured in the Plasma
- Example: for a 75 kg person (roughly 50 l), a dose of 100 mg will give a concentration of: 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 =𝐴𝑚𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡 / 𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 = 100 𝑚𝑔/50 𝑙 = 2𝑚𝑔/𝑙 = 2𝜇𝑔/𝑚𝑙
- Supposing we don’t know volume, then we can give a dose and measure plasma concentration achieved and assuming the drug dose is evenly distributed in the target tissue and plasma, the concentration at the tissue can be deduced.
- In this case, we might give a dose of 100 mg, and measure a concentration of 0.2 mg/l, which would result in: 𝑉𝐷 = 𝐷𝑜𝑠𝑒/𝐶0𝑝 = 100 𝑚𝑔 / 0.2 𝑚𝑔/𝑙 = 500 𝑙
- Therefore, drugs that are sequestered into tissues and hence, found at Low Concentrations in the plasma have High VDs
- A Value of VD of 3-5L suggests it is mainly distributed in the Vascular System
- A VD of 30-50 corresponds to TBW
- Compounds with specific concentrations in one or more tissues may have extremely low concentrations in the blood, and hence, have very large Vd
- Most compounds have a VD within a wide range of values

# Consequence of Drug Binding

- Activity - Bound drugs are usually inactive so the less bound it is, the more easily it can enter cells and produce its effects
- Acidic Drugs bind preferentially to Albumin and Basic Drugs bind preferentially to α1 Acidic Glycoproteins
- Both Acidic and Basic Drugs bind to Globulins and binding of these drugs is both reversible and non-reversible
- Absorption - May be enhanced by the sink effect, where low free concentration of the drug in the plasma (as it is bound to proteins) creates a steeper concentration gradient that enhances uptake of the drug into the plasma
- Distribution - Drug distribution is restricted to the distribution of the protein
- Storage - Protein bound drug is effectively a store as it cannot be filtered and is biologically inactive
- Elimination - No glomerular filtration of drug bound to protein as the protein cannot be filtered across the glomerular membrane
- Tubular secretion is unaffected
- Drugs with similar physicochemical characteristic can compete with each other or endogenous substances for binding to plasma proteins → Drug Displacement
- Displacement may enhance the activity of the displaced drug by increasing Free [ ].
- Important for highly bound drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. warfarin), where displacement can lead to rapid increases in Free [ ], causing side effects
- Assume: 98 % drug is bound and 2 % is free If only 2 % are displaced this results in 96 % drug is bound and 4 % is free
an increase in free drug of 100 %

# Role of Tissue Distribution

- Distribution to tissues via blood stream

| Organ | Perfusion Rate (mL/min/mL of Tissue) |
| --- | --- |
| Kidneys | 4.0-4.5 |
| Liver | 0.8-0.95 |
| Heart | 0.6-0.7 |
| Brain | 0.5-0.55 |
| Skin | 0.04-0.05 |
| Muscle | 0.025–0.030 |
| Bone | 0.025–0.030 |
| Fat | 0.01–0.03 |
- Thiopental (induction of anaesthesia) is only partly ionised and passes into brain or muscle easily.
- Therefore, perfusion limits its transport.
- Since brain has a higher perfusion rate, thiopental can transfer in and out more quickly, allowing it to re-enter the circulation and be distributed to the muscle.
- Penicillin is quite polar and is thus slowly permeable.
- Permeability limits transfer more significantly in the brain than in muscle as muscle capillaries are less
restrictive.

# Compartment Model

- Body is a series of compartments (tissue or group of tissue with similar perfusion, plasma, drug bound to plasma protein).
- Keep number of variables as small as possible.
- Mixing in a compartment is rapid and uniform distribution is assumed.
- Movement of drugs in and out of compartment is represented by rate constant.
- In a Single Compartment Model, the Drug is taken up into a single fluid compartment which is distributed across the entire body, with elimination only occurring from this single compartment
- Models describe open systems.
- Linear differential equations describe  behaviour of drug.
- Mammillary model is most common compartment model, with a central compartment that distributes the drug into all other compartments.

---

# Models

- 1 compartment model: drug elimination is drug excretion + drug metabolism.
- 2 compartment model: no exit out of 2nd compartment (2nd compartment merely contributes to drug metabolism), so drug elimination is drug excretion + drug metabolism from the 1st compartment.

# Elimination - 1 Compartment Model

- CP0 is drug concentration in plasma when 𝑡 = 0.
- Drugs eliminated through 1st order kinetics have a half-life.
- $A=A_0 ×e^{-k_{el}t}$
- A =  Amount of Drug in the Body at Time = t
- A0 = Amount of Drug in the Body at Time = 0
- Kel = Elimination rate constant
- t = time

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 19.46.46.png](%5BUMP2038%5D%20Pharmacology%20Metabolism%20and%20Excretion%20of%20bc398a16796740d08b7b252057fecee0/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_19.46.46.png)

- For the Concentration Equation with 1st Order Kinetics, dividing both sides by V produces an equation showing how Concentration changes over time with first order kinetics
- $C_p=C_0^p ×e^{-k_{el}t}$

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 19.47.10.png](%5BUMP2038%5D%20Pharmacology%20Metabolism%20and%20Excretion%20of%20bc398a16796740d08b7b252057fecee0/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_19.47.10.png)

### Calculation of Half-Life

- t1/2 when 50% of initial drug has been eliminated AKA $C_p=\frac12C_p^0$
- Dose variation: changing dose (starting concentration) does not affect half-life.
- $t_{1/2}=\frac{ln(2)}{k_{el}} = \frac{0.693}{k_{el}}$
- Rate constant variation: doubling elimination rate constant halves half-life.

---

# Linear Representation of 1st Order Kinetic

- Gradient: proportional to elimination rate constant times its constant.
- Using log means we do not have a constant to consider, then can estimate rate constant, because calculating 𝑦-intercept is much easier.
- y = mt + c
- y = log (Cp)
- m = $\frac{-k_{el}}{2.303}$
- c = log ($C_p^0)$

---

# Drug Accumulation (1st Order Kinetics - Doesn’t Work For 0 Order)

- There is a limit to drug accumulation
- Concentration approaches a plateau exponentially.
- Drugs with a long half life will approach this plateau slowly as rate at which plasma concentration approaches this plateau is determined by elimination rate constant (which is low for drugs with long half lives).
- If clinical effect is wanted more quickly, loading doses could be considered.
- Loading doses might be 1 or a few doses at a level which would be toxic if continued.

---

# Zero-Order Elimination

- Amount of drug A ↓ at a constant rate, independent of drug concentration, as it is typically found for saturating transport
systems and enzymes.
- Example: elimination of ethanol
- As a result, half life is not constant and is proportional to the concentration of the drug at that time
- $C_p = -k_{el}t+C_p^0$

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 19.51.36.png](%5BUMP2038%5D%20Pharmacology%20Metabolism%20and%20Excretion%20of%20bc398a16796740d08b7b252057fecee0/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_19.51.36.png)

---

# Non-Linear Kinetic (Michaelis-Menten)

- Some drugs (Mainly those metabolised by enzymes) are eliminated via First Order Kinetics at low doses when enzymes and transporters are not saturated (Km >> Cp), then becoming eliminated by Zero Order kinetics at high doses (Km << Cp) once these proteins are saturated

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 19.52.50.png](%5BUMP2038%5D%20Pharmacology%20Metabolism%20and%20Excretion%20of%20bc398a16796740d08b7b252057fecee0/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_19.52.50.png)

# Drug Accumulation - Zero Order Elimination

- First order kinetic: reaches saturation where plasma concentration plateaus.
- Zero order kinetic: depending on dose accumulation, drug concentration can easily leave area of therapeutic index as it does not saturate/plateau.

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 19.54.02.png](%5BUMP2038%5D%20Pharmacology%20Metabolism%20and%20Excretion%20of%20bc398a16796740d08b7b252057fecee0/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_19.54.02.png)

# Drug Distribution in the CNS

- Distribution into CNS is unique (BBB).
- Brain capillary endothelial cells are connected by tight junctions.
- Brain capillary endothelial together with pericapillary glial cells constitute BBB.
- Drug penetration depends on transcellular transport as tight junctions prevent paracellular transport.
- Lipid solubility of non-ionised species of drug is important determinant for uptake into the CNS.
- More lipophilic a drug is, more likely it is that drug crosses BBB.
- Useful information to alter drug distribution in drug design.
- Drug may penetrate into CNS by specific uptake mechanism.
- Drug may enter brain via CSF via choroid plexus and then diffuse passively through brain.

---

# Drug Excretion

- Excretion is removal of waste products.
- This occurs predominantly via urine formed in kidney.
- This is also case for drugs.
- Most drugs are biotransformed before being excreted.
- However, a number of polar and charged compounds, which are easily soluble in plasma, might be excreted in an unchanged form.
- Less important routes of excretion: saliva (gland), sweat (gland), tears (gland), faeces (intestine), milk (gland), exhaled air (lungs).

---

# Kidney Excretion

- 3 processes all occur in nephron: glomerular filtration, active tubular secretion, passive tubular reabsorption.

### Glomerular Filtration

- 20% of blood which enters glomerulus is filtered.
- Drugs with molecular weight < 20 kDa squeeze through fenestrated epithelium.
- Drug concentration in filtrate is identical to Free concentration in plasma as lipid solubility and pH do not influence the movement of drugs here and the movement is passive
- Drugs largely bound to plasma protein (e.g. warfarin) are not efficiently filtrated.
- Glomerular Filtrate rate in healthy individuals is 110-130 ml/min (180 l/day).
- Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is estimated with inulin.
- In clinical practice, GFR is measured using creatinine clearance.

### Tubular Secretion

- 80% of plasma flow enters peritubular capillaries, where there is active secretion into proximal tubule.
- As 80% of the Drug in the Plasma is presented to Carriers involved in Tubular Secretion, Tubular Secretion is likely the most efficient method of Drug Elimination
- 1 transport system for acidic (Organic Anion Transporter/OAT) and another for basic drugs (Organic Cation Transporter/OCT).
- These are relatively non-selective carriers, with OAT being possible to pump Cations/Acidic Drugs against their concentration gradient whilst OCT preferentially pumps Basic Drugs down their concentration gradient
- Saturation of transport system might occur if Drug [ ] is high or if multiple physicochemical drugs are in the plasma and hence, all competing for secretion by the same transporter
- Competition at Renal Transport Systems ↓ renal clearance of a specific drug and might result in ↑ toxicity but can be used therapeutically to potentiate the actions of the drug by prolonging its [ ] in the blood.
- Example: probenecid (for penicillin), cimetidine (for quinidine).
- Tubular clearance rate up to 650 ml/min.
- p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) used to measure tubular clearance.
- Drugs bound to plasma protein can be actively secreted in proximal tubule.

### Tubular Re-Absorption

- Re-absorption occurs in distal convoluted tubule.
- Water in filtrate from glomerular filtration has been reabsorbed in proximal tubule, causing a High drug concentration in proximal tubule.
- Lipid soluble (non-ionised) drugs are readily reabsorbed into plasma from the tubular filtrate.
- If the Urine is made more acidic/pH decreases, there was be increased reabsorption of acidic drugs and reduced reabsorption/increased excretion of basic drugs
- Therefore, in an attempt to lower the blood concentration of a specific drug (E.g Rx Overdose), Urine can be made more acidic to increase the excretion of Basic Drugs from the Plasma and Urine can be made more alkaline to increase the excretion of Acidic Drugs from the Plasma
- pH of urine varies between 4.5 – 8.0.
- Alkalisation of urine can be done via K-citrate, Na₂CO₃).
- Acidification of urine  can be done via NH₄Cl, ascorbic acid.

---

# Relationship Between Clearance Rate (Kel), t1/2 and VD

- If the body is represented by a Single Compartment and elimination can be described by first order kinetics, the clearance will depend on the clearance rate constant and Vd
- $Cl_T=k_{el}V_D = \frac{0.693}{t_{1/2}}V_D$

# Effect of Renal Disease on t1/2 of Tetracycline

- Renal Disease → Reduced Renal Function → Reduced Urine Production and Excretion → t1/2 increases (for drugs predominantly excreted in the Urine)

![Screenshot 2022-02-05 at 12.10.41.png](%5BUMP2038%5D%20Pharmacology%20Metabolism%20and%20Excretion%20of%20bc398a16796740d08b7b252057fecee0/Screenshot_2022-02-05_at_12.10.41.png)

# Biotransformation

- Kidney can effectively eliminate hydrophilic Drugs but cannot effectively eliminate Hydrophobic Drugs as these hydrophobic drugs are rapidly reabsorbed in the DCT and hence, there is little net filtration
- Drug metabolism is divided into 2 phases:
1. Phase I: functionalisation reaction.
2. Phase II: conjugative reaction.

### Phase 1 → Mainly P450 System

- Often involves Mixed Function Haem-Containing Oxidoreductases for Oxidation and Reduction
- Oxidation
- Reduction
- Hydrolysis
- Hydration
- Dethioacetylation
- Isomerisation

### Phase II

- If product of Phase I metabolism is sufficiently polar/Hydrophilic, it can be directly excreted into the Kidneys
- This is generally not the case so the Phase I Product is conjugated to another substance to make it inactive and polar enough that it can then be excreted by the kidney or in the Bile
- Drugs already containing Hydroxyl, Amino or Carboxyl Group may directly enter Phase II Reaction, bypassing Phase I Metabolism
- Drugs can also undergo multiple rounds of Phase I until they are in a form where they can be conjugated via Phase II Reactions

**Glucuronidation → Most Common and Important Reaction**

- UDP-Glucoronyltransferase
- Functional Groups Involved = -OH, -COOH, -NH₂ or -SH

**Glycosidation**

- UDP-Glycosyltransferase
- Functional Groups Involved = -OH, -COOH or -SH

**Sulfation**

- Sulfotransferase
- Functional Groups Involved =

**Methylation**

- Methyltransferase
- Functional Groups Involved = -OH or -NH₂

**Acetylation**

- Acetyltransferase
- Functional Groups Involved = -NH₂, -SO₂NH₂ or -OH

**Amino Acid Conjugation**

- Acetyltransferase
- Functional Groups Involved = -COOH

**Glutathione Conjugation**

- Glutathione-S-Transferase
- Functional Groups Involved = Epoixide or Organic Hallide

# Pharmacological and Toxicological Aspects of Drug Metabolism

- Pharmacological deactivation
- Pharmacological activation of prodrugs
- Change in type of pharmacological response (E.g Metabolism of Diazepam → Oxazepam, changing a Tranquiliser → Anti-Convulsant.
- No change in pharmacological activity.
- Change in drug absorption by making it more/less polar, decreasing/increasing its reabsorption.
- Change in drug distribution within various tissues.
- Trapped within the Enterohepatic circulation
