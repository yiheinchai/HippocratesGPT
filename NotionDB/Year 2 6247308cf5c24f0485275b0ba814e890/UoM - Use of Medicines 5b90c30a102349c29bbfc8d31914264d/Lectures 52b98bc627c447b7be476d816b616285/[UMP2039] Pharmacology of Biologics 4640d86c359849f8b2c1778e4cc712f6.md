# [UMP2039] Pharmacology of Biologics

# Technology/Definitions of Field

- Biopharmaceutical: substance produced from living organism (i.e. not synthesised in lab, including cytotoxic and some Anti-Cancer Molecules). Usually limited to macromolecule.
- Biologic: Consists of sugars, proteins or nucleic acids or a combination. These are produced by an organism that has been genetically engineered to synthesise the biologic
1. First generation: isolated from living organisms or tissues found naturally.
2. Second generation: isolated from genetically engineered organisms.
3. Third generation: Molecules that are completely engineered (not found in nature) and then produced by genetically modified organisms.
- Small molecular entity (SME): chemical with low molecular weight (e.g. aspirin mwt 180).
- Generic drug: exact copy of an existing drug/SME, produced when patented drug comes off patent.
- Due to the complexities in the manufacturing of Biologics, they cannot be directly copied so no Generics of Biologics are available
- Biosimilar (follow-on biologic): almost identical copy of a biologic (similar to Generic for SME).

# Comparison of Biopharmaceuticals to Traditional Medicines

### Biologics are More Specific/Complex in Their Actions Than Traditional Drugs

- Biologicals are more specific in their actions than traditional drugs due to their high target affinity, much higher than that seen with SMEs
- This means that their side effects are associated with ON target effects (interaction with intended target), as compared with OFF target effects (interaction with non-intended target) that can also occur alongside On Target Effects with SMEs (especially when ‚Üë concentration).
- Biologics have multiple binding sites (because they are usually proteins) and can elicit multiple functions.
- They often target extracellular signalling molecules and have a greater potential to target underlying pathology rather than symptoms (e.g. replacement therapy for some diseases).

![Screenshot 2022-02-12 at 20.12.09.png](%5BUMP2039%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Biologics%204640d86c359849f8b2c1778e4cc712f6/Screenshot_2022-02-12_at_20.12.09.png)

### Significant Different in Chemistry

- Biologics are significantly larger than SME.
- Larger molecule gets, more labile/heat sensitive it is.
- SME tend to be non-immunogenic and tend to be species independent (infection caused by SME in animal could therefore be translated into humans).
- Because of its small size, can be orally active (patient can self-administer). Short-acting.
- Biologics are proteins, so entering body will cause an immune reaction as they can be presented by APCs.
- Tend to be species dependent (i.e. antibody against mouse TNFùõº will not translate into humans).
- Because of large size and poor bioavailability, need to be injected, and hence given by medical staff.
- They are Long-acting

### Production

- SME are produced in lab. Biologics are produced by well-defined and optimised chemical synthesis pathways (expression systems) in an organism and involves biochemical engineering.
- This ensures that the biologics are pure and high yield, which can be easily monitored via techniques like Mass Spectrometry and replicated across multiple sites
1. Expression systems: bacteria, yeast, plant, inset, mammals. 
- However, there are problems associated with step-to-step control of the Biosynthetic Pathways in the Organism
- Therefore, it is important when producing biologics to ensure that the genetically engineered organism is synthesising the correct biologic, that the Biologic Yield can be significantly increased without compromising the purity/viability of the genetic organism and that the Biologic can be isolated from other metabolic products and the growth medium (E.g Adding mechanism to enable the release of the Biologic from the Organism)
- This means there can be significant regulatory problems associated with Biologic production and licensing regarding product contamination, product activity, batch variability and product stability.
- Via Post-Translational Modification of the Biologic by the Organism (E.g Glycosylation), this can alter the affinity of the Biologic
- As cells within a single species (Different Cell Batches) and across different species produce different patterns of Glycosylation/Post-Translational Modification, this means that the final Biologics produced after Post-Translational Modification by different batches/cells are very similar but not identical, meaning that copies of Biologics are Biosimilars but not Generics

### Perceived Benefits of Biopharmaceutics Over Traditional Drugs

- Highly specific ‚Üí Less off-target/idiosyncratic effects and hence, often well tolerated.
- Can replace/repair underlying pathology.
- Quicker to clinic (on average 1 year) due to well developed methods of Biologic Formation.
- Entry to market is higher (due to expensive infrastructure required for their manufacture) and patent longer and further in scope.

### Perceived Problem of Biopharmaceuticals over Traditional Drugs

- Type A adverse reactions (exaggerated normal pharmacological effects) may be more of a problem due to their difficult pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics.
- Immune response (notably anti-biologic antibodies) which ‚Üì effect of the Biologic
- Due to their complexity, they are often difficult to store, Labile and must be administered by trained HCPs

# Classification of Protein Therapeutics

- Protein therapeutics (recombinant proteins, antibodies) are classified according to function.

### Group 1 - Enzymes and Regulatory Proteins

| Group | Function | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1a | Replacing a protein which is deficient or
abnormal. | Insulin and Human growth hormone |
| 1b | Augmenting an existing pathway. | Human follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH) and IFNŒ≥ |

# Insulin

- 1920 ‚Üí Banting, Macleod, Best and Noble investigate pancreas extracts in dogs which reverses diabrtes in dogs.
- 1921 ‚Üí Banting, Best with Collip used calf pancreas to avoid digestion from pancreatic enzymes.
- 1922 ‚Üí Banting, Best with Collip used calf pancreas to isolate ‚Äòisletin‚Äô to avoid digestion from pancreatic enzymes.
- 1922 ‚Üí Leonard Thompson treated patient 1.
- 1922 ‚Üí Eli Lilly begins to produce large amounts of insulin from cattle and pigs.
- 1955 ‚Üí Amino Acid structure of Insulin was determined.
- 1977 ‚Üí Spliced rat insulin into a microbe and produced insulin.
- 1982 ‚Üí Recombinant human insulin produced.
- 1991 ‚Üí 95% of patient use recombinant insulin.
- 2002 ‚Üí Animal insulin production stops.
- This led to the development of Insulin Analogues with variable rates of Onset and Duration
- Hence, Insulin is often known as the First Biologic
- Problems with animal insulin:
1. Insulin allergy (likely due to contaminants but may be due to slight AA Variations across species)
2. ‚Üë insulin purity, ‚Üì toxicity but ‚Üì activity.
3. Batch to batch variation.
4. Patent compliance (due to reduced effectiveness and allergic responses).

# Human Growth Hormone

- 1887 ‚Üí Minkowski linked the pituitary gland to acromegaly.
- 1944 ‚Üí Human growth hormone isolated.
- 1958 ‚Üí Patient with hypopituitary successfully treated with Human GH (hGH) isolated from human pituitaries.
- However, whilst Insulin has a highly conserved structure across different species, GH is highly species specific in its structure, with non-human GH not working on humans
- 1961 ‚Üí Nation Pituitary Agency established ($2 per pituitary) to suppress the ‚ÄòPituitary Gland‚Äô black market.
- No potency testing performed.
- 1978 ‚Üí Genetech (founded 1977) succeeded in producing recombinant rGH.
- 1985 ‚Üí First case of Creutzfeld-Jacob disease reported in patient taking hGH, leading to preferred usage of rGH over hGH due to the increased purity of Recombinant Biologics (reduced risk of Iatrogenic Infection).
- Problems collecting sufficient Human Pituitaries:
- Typical patient requires 1mg GH/day. 1 human pituitary results in 1 mg GH. Therefore, each patient requires 365 pituitaries/year, despite very few Pituitary Glands being harvested.

# Antibody Structure

- Antibody has an Fab Region that binds the Ag and Fc (Constant) region that can bind and activate Compliment or act as a Ligand to receptors

# Anti-TNFŒ± Therapies

### Identification of TNFùõº

- First mAb licensed = Orthoclone okt3 ‚Üí Prevent Kidney Tx rejection
- TNF-ùõº was discovered as Serum from Endotoxin Treated Animals had anti-tumour properties, leading to the isolation of TNFùõº  from this serum that produced these properties
- When Injected into Subjects, TNFùõº produces Sx similar to Shock and Sepsis, leading to Tissue Necrosis
- This led to the theory that in conditions like Sepsis, TNFùõº might be the main mediator of damage
- If an animal subject was injected with G -ve Bacteria, this induced Sepsis and led to death
- If an Anti TNF-ùõº mAb is injected into an Animal before G -ve Bacteria were introduced, this produced no Sepsis, with MAP remaining stable (not lowered as normally seen in Sepsis)
- However, this did not translate to Clinical Trials as Anti-TNFùõº Drugs were not shown to be effective in Rx Sepsis

---

# Therapeutic Action of Antibodies

- They bind extracellular protein targets
- Can use antibodies for drug delivery (notably cancers where Toxin-Linked Abs are used to kill cancer cells), blocking receptors (soluble or cell-surface proteins to act in a similar manner to Chelators or Antagonists respectively), cell signalling, targeting cell for cell death, activating complement and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (notably in cancer where Ab is targeted against Cancer cell, with Fc region activating Complement or Lymphocytes to lyse the cell).

# Rheumatoid Arthritis and Therapeutic Antibodies

### Therapeutic Antibodies

- Most mAb are IgG
- Initially, Mouse mAbs were used Therapeutically but as these are different to Human mAbs, they triggered an immune response directed against the therapeutic mAb, causing rapid clearance of the Therapeutic mAb which reduces their effect ‚Üí This is avoided by Humanising the mAb
- Towards right, suffix of antibodies shows how human-like it is. More human-like it is, less immune response.
- -omab ‚Üí Directly derived from Mouse Hybridoma and hence, contains Mice/Non-Human mAb
- -iximab ‚Üí Human Fc and Mouse Fab Chimeric mAb
- -zumab ‚Üí Only Hypervariable Regions are derived from Mouse mAb
- -umab ‚Üí Fully Humanised
- Drug that end in -cept = Fusion Receptors (Act as a Soluble form of the Receptor for the Soluble Target to chelate it and prevent its activity)
- The other property determining the Effect of the mAb apart from Target Specificity via Fab region = Fc Region, which influences the ability of the mAb to activate Lymphocytes and/or Complement
- IgG1 and 3 can effectively bind to Fc Receptors and activate Complement to produce Complement Activation and ADCC (Commonly used in Cancer mAb as they activate Lysis Pathways)
- IgG2 and IgG4 have a low affinity for Fc Receptors and Complement and hence, produce Little Complement Activation and ADCC and so, are often used in Therapeutic mAb that antagonise or chelate its target (E.g Anti-TNFùõº)

![Screenshot 2022-02-13 at 11.57.36.png](%5BUMP2039%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Biologics%204640d86c359849f8b2c1778e4cc712f6/Screenshot_2022-02-13_at_11.57.36.png)

### Rheumatoid Arthritis

- As TNFùõº can drive the production of other Pro-inflammatory Mediators, it has been speculated that TNFùõº is important in the Pathogenesis of RA
- Infliximab - First Anti-TNFùõº mAb to be approved but as it is Chimeric, it can induce Immune Response against Itself which reduces its effectiveness
- Adalimumab and Golimumab are fully humanised mAb vs TNF-ùõº and therefore, do not trigger the Immune Responses that are characterised with Infliximab
- Certolizumab - Anti-TNFùõº Human Fab Fragment, with Polyethylene Glycol added to it to increase its stability
- Etanercept - Fusion Protein (TNFR2 Receptor bound to human Fc region) which chelates TNFùõº to prevent it from stimulating its receptors

![Screenshot 2022-02-13 at 11.58.21.png](%5BUMP2039%5D%20Pharmacology%20of%20Biologics%204640d86c359849f8b2c1778e4cc712f6/Screenshot_2022-02-13_at_11.58.21.png)

# Case Histories - Anti-TNFŒ±

- Need correct biologic target to produce the desired effects.
- Quick to market in competitive market.
- Animal data may not support target in biologics.
- Biologic may be useful in order disease ‚Äòre-positioning‚Äô where unsuccessful drugs originally developed to treat one disease can be used to treat other similar conditions with effectiveness
- Immune-reactions can happen.
- Side-effects associated with ON-target effects (E.g As TNFùõº is involved in the Immune Responses and Host Defence Mechanisms, Anti-TNFùõº Drugs can lead to Immunosuppression)
- Biosimilars

# Targeting CTLA-4 (Abatacept and Ipilimumab)

- CTLA-4 inhibition is a new treatment for melanoma.
- Signal 1: T cell interacts with pMHC Class II.
- Signal 2: CD28 with CD80/86 (B7) causing T cell to become fully activated, proliferate and differentiate.
- If CD28 interacts CTLA-4 (Upregulated in some T Cell Populations), the T Cell doesn‚Äôt proliferate, but instead turns off (Cell Cycle Arrest).
- Abatacept - CTLA-4 Fusion Protein used to Rx RA
- CTLA-4 is bound to the Fc Region of a mAb to increase the stability of the protein complex
- This prevents CD80/86 Complex on APC from binding to CD28 on T Cell, preventing 2nd Second from occurring. This suppresses the T Cell Response to reduce Inflammation
- Ipilimumab: Anti-CTLA-4 Antibody (Checkpoint Inhibitor) used to Rx Melanoma/Cancer.
- In the Microenvironment of some tumours, T Cells upregulate CTLA-4, to reduce T Cell Activation to prevent Lysis of the Cancerous Cells
- Ipilimumab blocks CTLA-4 to prevent T Cell inhibition by CTLA-4, increasing T Cell Activation to lead to the Lysis of Tumour Cells
- Due to their role in stimulating T Cell Response, they can often cause Inflammatory Conditions and Visceral Inflammation as Side Effects
- E.g Px given an Anti-CD28 mAb (Theoretically to Rx Cancers and Autoimmune Conditions), this led to a highly pronounced T Cell Response, causing Widespread Sepsis-Like Inflammation that was life threatening
- Can produce biologics which have agonist or antagonist.

# Current Limitations and Challenges

- Only extracellular targets although iRNA Based Drugs may solve this problem
- Poor bioavailability, which means that they cannot be taken orally currently
- Translation from in vivo to clinical trials can be a problem (e.g. TGN1412).
- Correct target identification and stratification of patients is necessary.
- Expensive

# Some (Rare) Safety Issues with TNF-ùõº Therapeutics

- Serious infections
- Opportunistic infections (e.g. TB).
- Malignancies
- Demyelination ‚Üí Px with MS Should not take Anti-TNFùõº Drugs
- Haematological abnormalities
- Administration reactions
- Congestive heart failure.
- Autoantibodies and lupus-like syndrome
