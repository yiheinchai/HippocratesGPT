# [UMP2008] Pharmacological Basis of the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure

# Cardiac Physiology and Pressure/Volume Changes

- Most cases of Cardiac Failure are associated with Left Ventricular Dysfunction
- Duration of Cardiac Cycle = 0.85s, with 0.3s of Systole and 0.55s of Diastole (0.25s before and 0.3s after Systole)
- At the Beginning of Systole and Diastole, there are Isovolumetric Phases characterised by large changes in Pressure and no changes in volume as all the valves are shut
- Mitral Valve closes when P Aortic > P Ventricles > P Atria at the start of Isovolumetric Contraction and Aortic Valve opens when P Ventricle > P Aortic at the end of Isovolumetric Contraction
- Aortic Valve closes when P Atrium < P Ventricle < P Aortic at the start of Isovolumetric Relaxation and when P Ventricle < P Atrium, Mitral Valve opens at the end of Isovolumetric Relaxation

# PV Loops

- Normal ESV = 50ml, Normal EDV = 125 ml and normal SV = 75 ml
- The bottom right corner of the PV Loop = Start of Isovolumetric Contraction
- Isovolumetric Phases = Straight Vertical Lines on PV Loop
- At the end of Isovolumetric Contraction, blood flows out of the Heart into the Aorta, causing Pressure to increase initially due to the movement of blood and then decreases due to little blood being left in the heart and a reduced pressure gradient driving ejection of blood
- Normal Maximum Systolic Pressure = 120 mmHg
- Pressure in Heart at the Start of Isovolumetric Relaxation > Pressure in Heart at the end of Isovolumetric Contraction
- Pressure in Heart at the end of Isovolumetric Relaxation > Pressure in the Heart at the Start of Isovolumetric Contraction
- At the end of Isovolumetric Relaxation, blood flows into of the Heart from the SVC and IVC, causing Pressure to decrease initially due to the relaxation of the heart muscle and then increase as the volume of blood in the heart increases

# Heart Failure

- End Diastolic Pressure and Volume = Bottom Right corner of PV loop and End Systolic Pressure and Volume = Top Left corner of the PV loop
- Width of PV loop = SV
- $Ejection Fracture = \frac{StrokeVolume}{End Systolic Volume}$
- $Elastance = \frac{EndSystolicPressure}{StrokeVolume}$ - This is the Gold Standard Measure of the Contractility of the Heart
- Diastolic Arterial Pressure = Height of Top Right Corner of PV Loop and Systolic Arterial Pressure = Height of Top Left Corner
- PP = SAP - DAP
- End Diastolic Pressure-Volume Relationship = Volume changes that occur when a complexed relaxed ventricle is filled with blood
- Filling of Completely Relaxed ventricle produces large changes in volume with small changes in pressure so the EDPVR Curve is very horizontal
- End Systolic Pressure-Volume Relation = Pressure changes that occur when a completed relaxed ventricle containing a certain volume of blood contracts
- This produces a large change in pressure with a proportional change in volume, producing a diagonal straight line
- The PV loop always fits within the space bound by the EDPVR and ESPVR, with the ESPVR being tangental to the End-Systolic/Top Left point of the PV Loop and the EDPVR being tangental to the End-Diastolic/Bottom Right point of the PV Loop
- Slope of ESPVR is a measure of Cardiac Contractility and the Slope of EDPVR is a measure of Compliance
- In Heart Failure, there is often a reduction in Cardiac Contractility, causing the slope of the ESPVR Curve to be shallower
- This causes the PV loop to get narrower and shorter as the End-Systolic Volume and Pressure have decreased
- In Severe Heart Failure with drastic decreases in the slope of the ESPVR Curve, there can be translation of the PV loop up the EDPVR Curve so that ESV, EDP and EDV increase
- This reduction in SV seen causes EF to decrease
- Systolic Heart Failure = Heart Failure with Reduced EF and is when EF < 40%

- Some conditions can cause Diastolic Dysfunction where the Compliancy of the Heart Decreases but Contractility may not be affected
- Here, the gradient of the EDPVR increases and becomes shortened, causing the PV loop to become smaller (EDV and EDP Shorten)
- Here, as both SV and EDV get smaller, EF remains constant/unchanged whilst the volume of blood being ejected from the Heart (SV) and in the circulation (ECV) decreases and is unable to meet the needs of the Body
- This is called Diastolic Heart Failure or Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction

# Heart Failure and Its Causes

- Heart Failure is characterised by Reduced Heart Function (E.g Low CO), meaning the heart cannot pump enough blood to maintain organ/tissue perfusion to meet the metabolic demands of the body
- It can be Acute or Chronic, Left Ventricle or Right Ventricle (or both)
- Chronic Mild Heart Failure may only become evident with an increased demand, meaning the heart needs to work harder to maintain the increased metabolic needs of the body such as exercise (which the heart is unable to do due to heart failure)

### Causes

- For the heart to function properly it needs:

# Compensatory Mechanisms in Heart Failure

- Physiological mechanism are activated that may return CO to normal levels, at least in the short term
- When there is Cardiac Damage, this leads to:
1. Reduced Contraction of the Heart
2. Reduced CO (Less blood leaves the Heart and enters the circulation)
3. Reduced Oxygen delivery to tissues
- Receptors in Vessels and kidneys sense this and try to compensate for this and increase CO back to normal levels
- This means:
1. Heart needs to work harder (Cardiac Work Increases)
2. Oxygen and Metabolic Demands of the heart increase
3. Increased Cardiac work may increase damage, and worsen cardiac function

### Development of Cardiac Failure

1. Reduced CO causes BP to drop
2. This is detected by Baroreceptors and Kidneys, increasing SNS Outflow and triggering the release of Renin respectively
3. Renin increases the generation of Angiotensin II, which increases Aldosterone Release
4. This causes increased Na⁺ and H₂O reabsorption, increasing ECV and hence, increasing Preload
5. Increased SNS outflow Causes Arterial Vasoconstriction, increasing TPR and hence, Afterload
6. This increased Afterload is compensated for by an increase in CO (which is further increased by SNS Activity) in order to maintain tissue perfusion
7. Increased SNS outflow causes increased Venous Constriction, increasing Venous Return and hence, Preload
8. Increase in Preload causes an increase in SV and CO due to Frank-Starling Mechanisms
9. Eventually, the heart would be unable to meet these increasing demands for higher CO, leading to Cardiac Failure

# Symptoms of Heart Failure

1. Decreased Exercise tolerance
2. Tachycardia
3. Oedema
4. Shortness of Breath (Dyspnoea)
5. Cardiac Remodelling (Ventricular Dilation/Dilated Cardiomyopathy)
- Cardiac Remodelling is the genomic, molecular, cellular and interstitial changes that are manifested clinically as changes in size, shape and function of the heart after cardiac injury

---

# Objectives of Heart Failure Therapy

1. Improve Sx
2. Improve functional capacity
3. Enhance quality of life
4. Reduce frequency of Hospitalisations
5. Decrease associated mortality
- This can be achieved by approaches/treatments which slow/reduce the Cardiac Remodelling process

---

# Treatment of Heart Failure

- Aims =
1. Increase the efficacy of Cardiac Contractions
2. Counteract Compensation

### Direct Inotropes

- Increase the contractility of the heart and hence, strength of Contractions
1. Cardiac Glycosides (Digoxin etc.)
2. β1 Agonists (E.g Dobutamine)
3. Phosphodiesterase (Type III) Inhibitors (E.g Milrinone)

### Indirect - Reduce Cardiac Work

1. Diuretics:
- Loop Diuretics (E.g Furosemide)
- Aldosterone Antagonists (E.g Spironolactone)
- K⁺ Sparing Diuretics (E.g Amiloride)
- ACE Inhibitors (E.g Enala**pril**, Ramipril, Captopril)
1. β-Receptor Antagonists/β Blockers (E.g Carvedi**lol**, Bisoprolol)
2. Vasodilators (E.g Nitrates, Hydralazine)

---

# Cardiac Glycosides

- First drugs developed to treat Cardiac Failure
- These cause CO to increase significantly and HR to decrease
- They also cause body weight to decrease and Urine output to increase
- Their effects are long lasting (2 weeks roughly)
- They increase myocardial contractility by increasing [Ca²⁺] in Cardiomyocytes
1. Cardiac Glycosides inhibit the activity of the Sarcolemmal Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase, reducing Na⁺ efflux, causing intracellular [Na⁺] to increase 
2. This increase in [Na⁺] reduces the activity of the Sarcolemmal Na⁺/Ca²⁺ Exchanger (NCX), causing intracellular [Ca²⁺] to increase, increasing Myocardiac Contractility

![Screenshot 2021-10-23 at 13.57.38.png](%5BUMP2008%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%209d18b543acab4b6c9e771754cab5b34d/Screenshot_2021-10-23_at_13.57.38.png)

- It also increases PSNS/Vagal Tone and decreases SNS activity, suppressing AV Node conduction which increases the duration of the Refractory Period and Decreases Conduction Velocity, hence decreasing HR
- It improves Sx with a moderate reduction in hospitalisation but does not improve Survival
- It is very potent and so has a Low Therapeutic Index (0.7-3 ng ml⁻¹) to produce therapeutic effect without toxic effect
- It is contraindicated in Ventricular Fibrillation and AV Block
- Major Side Effect - Altered K⁺ Homeostasis

---

# β1- Adrenergic Agonist

- E.g Dobutamine and Dopamine
- They bind to β1-AR, Activating Gs.
- This activates Adenylyl Cyclase, increasing cAMP production, which activates PKA
- This leads to increased Phosphorylation of Sarcolemmal L-Type Ca²⁺ Channels, Increasing Intracellular [Ca²⁺] and hence, increased Contraction

![Screenshot 2021-10-23 at 14.04.26.png](%5BUMP2008%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%209d18b543acab4b6c9e771754cab5b34d/Screenshot_2021-10-23_at_14.04.26.png)

- They are mainly used as short term continuous support in advanced heart failure (used for <48 hrs)
- They are only used in Refractory Congestive Heart Failure
- Side Effects = Angina, Arrhythmias, Tachycardia, Anxiety, Fatigue and Headaches

---

# Decompensation and Neurohumoral Activation

- Angiotensin II directly acts on the Myocardium to produce ventricular remodelling
- Increased SNS Tone to the heart causes Myocyte Death and leads to increased risk of Arrhythmias
- Main Aim of Drugs which prevent compensatory mechanisms is to:
1. Reduced Preload, Afterload and Na⁺ Retention
2. Reduce Myocyte Death via SNS Activity
3. Slow down the Cardiac Remodelling Process
- This can be done by:
1. Blocking the RAAS (Production and Activity of AT2) 

![Screenshot 2021-10-23 at 14.05.58.png](%5BUMP2008%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%209d18b543acab4b6c9e771754cab5b34d/Screenshot_2021-10-23_at_14.05.58.png)

# Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System

- Decreased Renal Perfusion is detected by the Juxtaglomerular Apparatus, which converts Angiotensinogen (produced by the Liver) into AT1
- AT1 is converted into AT2 by ACE (Expressed on Pulmonary and Renal Epithelia)
- AT2 has multiple effects on the body:
1. Increases SNS Activity
2. Promotes NaCl reabsorption, Water Retention and K⁺ excretion
3. Increases Aldosterone release from the Adrenal Cortex, which increases Na⁺ and Water Reabsorption
4. Arteriolar Vasoconstriction
5. Increased ADH Secretion from the Posterior Pituitary Gland which increases Water Reabsorption
- This increases Water and Salt Retention to increase ECV to improve renal perfusion
- β-Blockers can block Renin Production as Renin Production is under SNS Control, mediated by β1 stimulation
- Renin Inhibitors directly block the activity of Renin
- ACE Inhibitors block the conversion of AT1 to AT2
- Angiotensin Receptor Blockers can block the Activity of AT2
- Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists can block the activity of Aldosterone

![Screenshot 2021-10-23 at 14.19.13.png](%5BUMP2008%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%209d18b543acab4b6c9e771754cab5b34d/Screenshot_2021-10-23_at_14.19.13.png)

### RAAS and Heart Failure

- Blocking of RAAS has shown to be highly effective in reducing the Mortality associated with Heart Failure

---

# ACE Inhibitors and ARB's

- ACE Inhibitor = Enalapril, Ramipril, Captopril
- ARB = Losartan
- First line agents in heart failure, significantly increasing survival/reducing mortality
- They decrease afterload (by reducing AT2-Mediated Vasoconstriction) and promote vasodilation
- They reduce/slow the Cardiac Remodelling process by reducing SNS outflow
- They may lead to Hypotension when used with Diuretics
- Side Effects - Can produce a Severe Cough and Angioedema (due to elevated Bradykinin Levels) and Hyperkalaemia
- ARBs are used when the Adverse effects of ACE Inhibitors are not tolerated

---

# Diuretics

- Spironolactone = Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist
- They lower Left Ventricular Filling Pressure and Volume by reducing Preload
- They lower Myocardial Oxygen Demand
- They reduce Pulmonary Oedema
- They are commonly combined with ACE Inhibitors when used to Rx Heart Failure
- In Px with Poor Renal Perfusion, some Diuretic Resistance is seen, where Diuretics become less effective

---

# Vasodilators

- E.g Nitroprusside, Nitroglycerin, Isosobide Dinitrate, Hydralazine, Prazosin
- They reduce Vascular Pressure by:
1. Lowering Arterial Pressure
2. Increasing Venous Capacitance
- They are used for Severe Decompensated Heart Failure in individuals with Comorbidities

---

# Effect of β Blockade on the Heart

- During the Heart Failure Compensation process, Increases SNS Activity:
1. Produced Positive Inotropy and Chronotropy
2. Leads to Myocardial Death and increased risk of developing Arrhythmias
3. Leads to Cardiac Remodelling
- β-AR Blockade in the heart reduces HR, Myocardial Contractility and BP, which all reduces the Oxygen Demand of the Heart
- Reduced HR increases the duration of Diastole, which increases Myocardial Perfusion and Increases Left Ventricular Diastolic Volume
- This increase in Left Ventricular Diastolic Volume leads to an increase in Oxygen Availability and Supply to tissues
- β Blockers decrease All-Cause Mortality in Heart Failure and increases survival
- When used to Rx Heart Failure, Different β-Blockers seem to have the similar efficacy, but mainly, Metaprolol, Bisoprolol and Carvedilol are used
- Out of the 3 main β-Blockers used, Carvedilol has been shown to produce the most profound decrease in all-cause Mortality

---

# Summary

- Gold Standard Treatment for Systolic Heart Failure = ACE Inhibitor/Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker, Spironolactone and Carvedilol
- There is no evidence that the Drugs used to treat Systolic Heart Failure are effective in treating Diastolic Heart Failure/Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction
