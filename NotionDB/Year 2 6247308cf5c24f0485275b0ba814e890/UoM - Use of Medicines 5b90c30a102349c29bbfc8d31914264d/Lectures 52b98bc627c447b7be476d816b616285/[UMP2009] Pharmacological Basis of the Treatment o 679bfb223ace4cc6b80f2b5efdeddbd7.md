# [UMP2009] Pharmacological Basis of the Treatment of Angina

# Angina Pectoris

- Caused by Coronary Insufficiency, meaning there is insufficient supply of blood to the myocardium to support its function (Insufficient Oxygen supply to myocardium to meet its metabolic demands)
- Symptoms = Ischaemic Chest pain caused by angina usually:
1. Chest feels tight or heavy (dull pain)
2. May spread to the left arm, neck, jaw or back
3. Triggered by physical exertion or stress
4. Stops within a few minutes of resting
- Chest pain is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle
- It is not usually life threatening but is a warning sign for an increased risk of a heart attack or stroke

### Types of Angina Pectoris

- There are 3 types of Angina:
1. Stable Angina (Most common) - Predictable chest pain onset on exertion (usually exercise). It is caused by atherosclerotic coronary vessels (partial blockage of the Coronary Arteries)
2. Unstable Angina - Pain occurs with minimal exertion. This is usually caused by a thrombus in the coronary arteries
3. Variant Angina - Pain occurs at rest/no exercise and is not affected by exercise. This is usually caused by Coronary Artery Spasms caused by dysfunctional vascular muscle

# Determinants of Myocardial Oxygen Consumption

1. Heart Rate
2. Contractility
3. Wall Tension
- Myocardial Oxygen Consumption increases 10 fold between rest and maximal exercise.
- Coronary Blood Flow has to increase by a similar amount to meet these increased oxygen demands and is affected by
1. Physical Factors
2. Vascular Control of Blood Flow by Metabolites
3. Neural and Humoral Control
- The heart has a smaller blood supply (Coronary Flow) in relation to its oxygen consumption than most organs as it extracts a significant quantity of oxygen from the blood that supplies it
- Coronary Blood flow only occurs during Diastole as contraction of the heart during systole compresses the coronary vessels to prevent coronary blood flow
- Exercise further reduced coronary blood flow by:
1. Shortening Diastole due to an increase in HR
2. Increased End Diastolic Ventricular Pressure (due to increased preload and increased wall tension)
3. Reduced Diastolic Arterial Pressure

# Treatment of Angina Pectoris

- Aim is to improve myocardial perfusion or reduce metabolic demand of the Heart (or both)

### Drugs

1. Vasodilators - To increase Coronary Blood Flow:
- Organic Nitrates/Nitriles
- Ca²⁺ Channel Antagonists
- K⁺ Channel Activators
1. Metabolic Demand:
- β-AR Antagonists
- Surgery - Bypass or Coronary Angioplasty using Stents

---

# Organic Nitrates

- Nitrites = Amyl Nitrite
- Nitrites were the first successful treatment developed for Angina Pectoris
- Nitrites have now been replaced by Nitrates
- Nitrates = Glyceryl Trinitrate/Nitroglycerin and Isosorbide Mononitrate
- Isosorbide Mononitrate is longer acting than Nitroglycerin
- Within the Vascular Smooth Muscle, they are denitrated to act as NO Donors
- Here, the NO Relaxes all smooth muscle within the Vasculature via Guanylate Cyclase Activation (Exact Mechanism is unknown)

---

# Physiological Actions of Nitrates

1. Pronounced Vasodilation of Large Veins
- This reduces venous return, which reduces Preload and Stroke Volume
- This also causes Venous Pooling and can cause Postural Hypotension as a side effect (Vessels are dilated and hence, cannot constrict properly to increase TPR to maintain ECV upon standing)
1. Hypotension
- Hypotensive effects means that there is a risk of fainting associated with Nitrate Use
- They cause a reduction in Myocardial Oxygen Consumption and increased Coronary Blood Flow
- Indirectly, they can cause Possible Reflex Tachycardia via stimulation of the Baroreceptors due to Hypotension, which reduces the duration of Diastole and hence, reduces Coronary Blood Flow
1. Arteriolar Vasodilation
- This can cause Flushing and headaches as side effects
- Small doses of Nitrates have little effect on Arterioles, with large doses being required to cause Arteriolar Vasodilation

### Nitrates Vs Dipyridamole

- Dipyridamole is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and a vasodilator
- Where there are regions of vessels with reduced blood flow and hypoperfused tissue (due to Atherosclerotic Plaque etc.), Arterioles are dilated (in an attempt to increase perfusion)
- If Px with Hypoperfused Region of Myocardium is given Dipyridamole, Arterioles with normal blood flow dilate whilst Collaterals between vessels supplying well and poorly perfused Myocardium remain constricted
- This increases the perfusion of well-perfused areas, redirecting blood from the Ischaemic area of Myocardium with poor perfusion towards well-perfused areas of the heart, increasing the extent of Hypoperfusion and Ischaemia
- When a Px with Hypoperfused regions of the Myocardium is given Nitrates, Collaterals between well and hypoperfused areas of Myocardium dilate whilst arterioles supplying well perfused myocardium do not dilate
- This causes blood flow to be redirected from well perfused areas of Myocardium towards Ischaemic Areas, reducing the extent of Ischaemia
- Therefore, Dipyridamole can be damaging to Px with Angina whilst Nitrates are beneficial

# Uses and Pharmacokinetics of Nitrates

### Uses

[Nitrates](%5BUMP2009%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%20679bfb223ace4cc6b80f2b5efdeddbd7/Nitrates%200fb2eb2e058a4db0bb8b1cf04a53d186.md)

---

- Increase in Duration of Effects and Decrease in Onset from Administration = Sublingual → Oral → Transdermal
- Biggest Problem is that upon sustained exposure/administration, the body becomes Tolerant to the drugs so the effects wear off quickly
- Therefore, Nitrates are administered as little times a day as possible to manage Sx in order to prevent the development of Tolerance
- Unwanted Side Effects - Postural Hypotension and Headache

# β-Adrenoceptor Antagonists

- E.g Atenolol
- Used for:
1. Prophylaxis of Stable Angina
2. Rx of Unstable Angina
3. Anti-Dysrhythmic
- They reduce HR, Myocardial Contractility and BP to reduce Oxygen Demand of the Heart
- Reduction in HR increases the duration of Diastole and the % of the Cardiac Cycle spent in Diastole, increasing Coronary Blood Flow and Myocardial Perfusion
- Decreased HR causes increased Filling Time, causing Left Ventricular Diastolic Volume to increase, increasing SV which leads to a reflex increase in Cardiac Work and Oxygen Demand of the Heart (Net Effect is still reduction in Oxygen Demand)
- If there is significant reflex increase in Oxygen Demand of the Heart, They can be co-administered with a Nitrate to further reduce BP and hence, the Oxygen Demand of the Heart

# Ca²⁺ Antagonists - Ca²⁺ Entry Blockers

- There are 3 types of Voltage Gated Ca²⁺ Channels found in the Heart:
1. L-Type
2. N-Type
3. T-Type
- L-Type are the main channels involved in Cardiac Contractility and hence, are the main channels targeted in the treatment of Angina
- There are 3 Classes of Ca²⁺ Channel Antagonists:
1. Phenylalkylamines - Verapamil
2. Dihydropyridines - Nifedipine
3. Benzothiazepines - Diltiazem
- They inhibit Ca²⁺ entry into cells of the Heart and Smooth Muscle (but not Skeletal) that is associated with Depolarisation
- These show some level of Selectivity between the Heart and the Vessels
- Phenylalkylamines (Verapamil) are more selective for the Heart and hence, are more Anti-Dysrhythmic
- Dihydropyridines (Nifedipine) are more selective for vessels and hence, are more anti-hypertensive
- Benzothiazepines (Diltiazem) do not show this selectivity
- Ca²⁺ Channel Antagonists reduce Afterload (by reducing BP) and Coronary Artery Vasodilation
- The effects of Ca²⁺ Channel Blockers on Coronary Artery Dilation means they are very important in Variant Angina

[Ca²⁺ Channel Blockers](%5BUMP2009%5D%20Pharmacological%20Basis%20of%20the%20Treatment%20o%20679bfb223ace4cc6b80f2b5efdeddbd7/Ca%C2%B2%E2%81%BA%20Channel%20Blockers%20932b7afa00d9461d923df5fa03f3e001.md)

---

# Side Effects of Ca²⁺ Channel Blockers

- Verapamil & Diltiazem - Suppression of Cardiac Contractility and Slowing of Conduction through the Heart
- This can produce Bradycardia or potentially, a High Degree AV Block
- Therefore, they are usually contraindicated with β-AR Antagonists as they also reduce HR and Contractility
- Verapamil - Headache, Constipation, Cardiac Failure and Heart Block
- Nifedipine - Ankle Oedema (Due to Vasodilation)

---

# Dipyridamole, Nicorandil and Ivabradine

### Dipyridamole

- Inhibits Adenosine uptake into Platelets
- Inhibits Phosphodiesterase, which blocks platelet aggregation and hence, can be used as an anti-thrombotic drug
- It can act as a Vasodilator at higher doses
- It is counterproductive in stable angina due to its vasodilation of arterioles but not collaterals, causing redirection of blood from poor to well perfused areas of the Myocardium

### Nicorandil

- Nitrate and K⁺ Channel Activator
- It produces Arterial and Venous Vasodilation
- It opens ATP-Sensitive K⁺ Channels (of the Muscle Type, SUR2A and SUR2B expressed in Cardiac and Smooth Muscle)
- This causes reduced HR as well

### Ivabradine

- Inhibits the ion channel responsible for If (Funny Current)
- Funny Current is a mixed cation current in the heart, slowly activated by hyperpolarisation, that is responsible for the pacemaker current
- This slows HR by increasing the duration of the Pacemaker phase of the Cardiac AP

---

# Other Drugs

- These do not act on the heart or coronary vasculature but are used in the treatment of Px with Coronary Artery Disease due to their prognostic benefits
1. Aspirin - Anti-platelet agent that suppresses the production of Thromboxanes and Prostaglandins
- Low doses of Aspirin act as prophylaxis against thrombosis
1. Statins (E.g Simvastatin) - Inhibit HMG-CoA Reductase, which catalyses the Rate-Limiting Step of Cholesterol Synthesis
- Statins are aimed at the treatment of underlying atherosclerosis by correcting Hypercholesterolaemia
1. Heparins (Low Molecular Weight Heparin) - Inhibit coagulation by Activating Antithrombin III, which inhibits Thrombin Formation and hence, thrombus formation
- It is administered IV or subcutaneously
1. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors (E.g Abciximab and Tirofiban) - These inhibit Platelet activation by blocking the Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor.
- They are therefore anti-platelet agents and are administered IV

# Management of Angina

1. Improving Coronary Blood Flow - Surgery or Vasodilators
2. Reducing Oxygen Consumption of the Heart Muscle - β-Blockers
3. Reducing the Risk of Thrombosis - Low Dose Aspirin, Heparin etc.
4. Reducing the Risk of Atheroma Formation - Statins
