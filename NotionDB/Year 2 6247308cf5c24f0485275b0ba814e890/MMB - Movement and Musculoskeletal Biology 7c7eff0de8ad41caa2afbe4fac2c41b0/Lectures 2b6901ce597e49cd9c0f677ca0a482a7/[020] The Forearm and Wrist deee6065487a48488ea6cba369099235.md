# [020] The Forearm and Wrist

# Forearm and the Wrist

- The forearm is the region of the upper limb between the elbow and wrist joint
- At the wrist joint, there is the carpal tunnel which is the gateway to the hand from the forearm

# The Radius and the Ulna (Covered Previously)

- Many forearm muscles originate from the distal end of the humerus, specifically off the lateral and medial epicondyles and the supraepicondylar ridges
- The radius and ulna make up the skeletal framework of the forearm itself
- The oblique line of the radius runs diagonally from the radial tuberosity as is a major attachment site for muscles in the forearm
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_12.43.07.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_12.43.07.png)
    
- In the anatomical position, the radius is lateral (side of the thumb) whilst the humerus is medial (side of the pinkie finger). They are also parallel to each other
- Proximally at the elbow joint, the ulna is larger than the radius
- At the wrist joint (distally), this is reversed as the radius is much larger than the ulna
- This has some important implications for how force is transferred through the upper limb
- The radius and ulna are bound together across the majority of their length by a tough sheet of connective tissue called the interosseous membrane, which has a distinctive orientation of its fibres
- The radius and ulna, along with the interosseous membrane divide the forearm into anterior and posterior compartments and are also involved in force transfer:
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_12.45.09.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_12.45.09.png)
    
- When force is coming up from the hand, through the carpals, most of this force goes through the larger distal end of the radius
- It is then transferred through the interosseous membrane and then, it is largely transferred to the ulna which is larger at the elbow joint
- It then goes up through the upper limb into the humerus
- The relative sizes of the radius, ulna and interosseous membranes affect force transfer
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_12.45.41.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_12.45.41.png)
    

### Distal End of the Radius

- The distal end of the radius is much larger than the ulna and it has a very prominent lateral radial styloid process which is palpable and articulates with the Scaphoid bone laterally and lunate bone medially.
- It has an ulnar notch medially which articulates with the head of the ulna
- On its posterior surface, it has a dorsal tubercle which is associated with the tendon of extensor pollicis longus
- Looking from its articular view (from below), it has two facets that articulate with the scaphoid and the lunate, moving medially
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_12.47.57.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_12.47.57.png)
    

### Distal End of the Ulna

- There is an ulnar styloid process medially, which is also palpable
- There is an attachment of an triangular articular disc at the end of the ulna

# Bones of the Wrist

- Many muscles of the forearm power movements of the fingers

### Bony Framework of The Hand - 27 Bones:

- There are 8 carpal bones arranged in two rows; proximal
and distal rows
- - There are 5 metacarpal bones which form the palm of the
hand
- There are 14 phalanges/finger bones:
• Digits II (Index Finger) to V (Pinkie Finger) each have 3
• Digit I (Thumb) has 2
- The carpal bones articulate in an oval shape and are not flat, they form an oval arch (anteriorly/palmar concave) which contributes to the formation of the carpal tunnel
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_12.52.10.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_12.52.10.png)
    
    ### Name of the Carpal Bones
    
    - Going lateral to medial, starting from the proximal row there is:
    1) Scaphoid
    2) Lunate
    3) Triquetrum
    4) Pisiform - This is a sesamoid bone, which forms within a tendon
    - In the distal row:
    1) Trapezium - This articulates with the thumb
    2) Trapezoid
    3) Capitate
    4) Hamate - This bears a prominent hook that can be palpated
    - Mneumonic - Going from lateral to medial starting from the proximal row:
    • **S**ome → **S**caphoid
    • **L**overs → **L**unate
    • **T**ry → **T**riquetrum
    • **P**ositions → **P**isiform

# The Wrist Joint

- It is formed by the distal end of the radius, which articulate with the scaphoid and lunate.
- Most of the load from the hand into the forearm at the wrist joint, around 55% is transmitted via the Scaphoid vs 35% via the Lunate. Remaining 10% is transmitted via triquetrum and articular disc into the ulnar
- The head of the ulna does not directly contact the carpal bones, it is rather the articular disc between the ulna and the triquetrum that form part of the wrist joint
- The radius is the major contributor of the wrist joint, with the joint itself being concave at the side of the forearm (Articular Surfaces of Ulna and Radius are concave)
- It is a synovial joint consisting of the radius, articular pad/disc of the ulna and three of the proximal carpal bones (Scaphoid, Lunate and Triquetrum). It allows flexion, extension, abduction and adduction (Circumduction)
    - All the Carpal bones share a common synovial capsule and articular cavity, with synovial joints between each of the carpal bones
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.01.00.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.01.00.png)

    ### Midcarpal Joint
    
    - This is between the proximal and distal rows of carpal bones
    - There is limited flexion and extension but is primarily involved in positioning the hands

---

# Movements

### Protonation and Supination (Previously Mentioned)

- The distal end of the radius has an ulnar notch and the articular head of the ulna fits into it
- The proximal end of the ulna has a radial notch and the radius fits into it
- During pronation, the proximal disc-shaped end of the radius spins against the radial notch of the ulna
- At the wrist, the end of the radius is flipped over and drags the thumb with it
- This results in the radius and ulna being crossed, where the radius is medial to the ulna
- In the anatomical position (when the hand is supinated), the radius and ulna are parallel to each other
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.04.05.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.04.05.png)
    
    ### Movements at the Wrist
    
    - There is a greater degree of adduction (bringing hand towards the body) than abduction (small amount of abduction possible)
    - There is also flexion and extension
    - When all four of these movements are possible, circumduction occurs
    - All of the muscles, that power the movements at the wrist are extrinsic to the hand, they have their origin in the forearm
    - They have bellies in the forearm and send long tendons to the hand
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.07.17.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.07.17.png)
    
    ### Movements of the Digits
    
    - Many of these are also powered by muscles of the forearm
    - There are different directions for movements of digits II -V then there is for the thumb
    
    For Digits II-V
    
    - Abduction is defined as moving digits away from the
    midline (middle finger/Digit III)
    - Adduction is defined as moving digits towards the midline (middle finger)
    - The middle finger/Digit III can adduct and abduct relative to itself
    - Flexion and extension can occur at a few different
    points:
    1) It can happen at the joints between the metacarpals and the first finger bone (Metacarpalphalangeal Joints between Palm and Fingers)
    2) It can also happen at the joints between individual finger bones (Interphalangeal Joints)
        
        ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.11.48.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.11.48.png)
        
    
    For Digit I 
    
    - The thumb has a special joint with the trapezium
    - It means that the thumb has a much greater range of motion than the other digits
    - As is it positioned 90° to the other fingers, this also means its movements are 90° to the fingers
    - Flexion and extension occur across and away from the palm respectively
    - Adduction and abduction occur 90° to the palm (Abduction = Away from Palm)
    - It is also capable of opposition (Contacting the tip of the thumb with those of the other fingers)

# Evolution of the Forelimb

- In four-legged mammals, the forearm is permanently pronated with the radius crossed over the ulna so that the hand is against the ground and the digits point forwards
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.21.55.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.21.55.png)
    
- This permanent pronation and the twisting of the Radius over the Ulna explains why the nerves and arteries switch between the anterior and posterior compartments of the arm and spiral around the upper limb.
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.22.18.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.22.18.png)
    
    - This is due to the fact that when the toes of our four-legged ancestors were shifted, it caused a twisting of the limb to maintain this permanent pronation
    - This permanent pronation meant that what was originally the posterior compartment ended up posterolateral, whilst what was originally the anterior compartment ended up anteromedial
    - When the muscles got twisted around, it dragged the associated nerves with them
    - This is why the muscles of the anterior compartment of the forearm, all originate from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and the ones in the posterior compartment originate from the lateral epicondyle and the lateral supraepicondylar ridge

---

# Compartments of the Forearm

- The compartments are separated by the radius and ulna, the interosseous membrane between the two bones and the intermuscular septa that come from the deep fascia of the forearm
- The deep fascia of the forearm is continuous with the deep fascia of the arm
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.23.54.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.23.54.png)
    
    - The muscles of the anterior compartment are responsible for flexing the wrist, as well as pronation of the forearm
    - The muscles of the posterior compartment are responsible for extension of the wrist, as well some supination
    - Depending on their position medially and laterally, these muscles are responsible for adduction and abduction of the wrist as well respectively.
        
        ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.25.11.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_13.25.11.png)
        
        - There are also muscle bellies in the forearm that act to flex or extend the fingers (depending on if they are in the anterior or posterior compartment respectively) and send long tendons down into the hand and fingers

---

# Muscles of the Anterior Forearm

- These muscles are responsible for flexing the wrist and fingers, and there is one muscle involved in supination
- They are all innervated by the median nerve except flexor carpi ulnaris as well as the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus which are innervated by the ulnar nerve
- They are divided into 3 Layers:

### Superficial Layer (4 Muscles)

- Going from lateral to medial, they are pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus and flexor carpi ulnaris
- They all originate off the medial epicondyle of the humerus, with some coming off the ulna
- They are all innervated by the median nerve (C5-T1) except flexor carpi ulnaris which is innervated by the ulnar nerve (C7-T1)

### Deep Layer (3 Muscles)

- They all originate off the front of the radius or ulna or the interosseous membrane
- They are innervated by the median nerve except for the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus

# Muscles of the Posterior Forearm

- The muscles are arranged into a superficial and a deep layer
- They are all innervated by the radial nerve or branches of the radial nerve
- They tend to originate off the lateral epicondyle or the lateral supraepicondylar ridge of the humerus
- One muscle flexes the forearm, whilst the others act to extend the wrist and fingers. There is also one supinator

[Superficial Layer (7 Muscles) - Lateral to Medial](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Superficial%20Layer%20(7%20Muscles)%20-%20Lateral%20to%20Medial%2052aaa6c4e7e449589aefeda39d7100f2.md)

- The muscles in the superficial layer run lateral (origin) to medial (insertion)
- The muscles in the deep layer run medial (origin) to lateral (insertion)

# Wrist Movements

- The flexor and extensor carpi muscles insert on the bases of metacarpals
- There are two flexors (flexor carpi radialis and ulnaris) which can contract together to flex the wrist
- There are three extensors (extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis and the extensor carpi ulnaris) which can contract together to extend the wrist
- If the flexor and two extensor carpi radialis muscles work together (lateral muscles), there will be abduction of the hand and if the flexor and extensor carpi ulnaris work together (medial muscles) there will be adduction of the hand
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_16.06.42.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_16.06.42.png)
    
- The spinal levels that power adduction are offset one level caudally/down to those that power abduction
    - Similarly, flexion seems to be offset one level caudally/down to extension
    
    ![%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_16.07.29.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Forearm%20and%20Wrist%20deee6065487a48488ea6cba369099235/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_16.07.29.png)
    
    ### Supination and Pronation
    
    - Pronation is being caused by contraction of pronator teres and pronator quadratus
    - Supination is being powered by supinator and biceps and is a more powerful action than pronation
    - Anconeus works to keep the hand steady during pronation and supination

# Vessels of the Forearm

### Brachial Artery

- The brachial artery passes through the cubital fossa, medial to the tendon of biceps
- Then, usually just below the elbow joint, it bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries
- The division can occur in the cubital fossa, arm and axilla (rarely) as well where it can cause clinical issues

### Radial Artery

- The radial artery goes down the lateral aspect of the arm:
- It is normally tucked under/deep to the margin of brachioradialis
- It typically throws off a superficial palmar branch that passes in front of the carpal tunnel
- The main branch goes into the posterolateral surface of the hand

### Ulnar Artery and Its Branches

- The ulnar artery is typically larger than the radial artery and travels down the medial side of the arm with the Ulnar Nerve
- It passes with the ulnar nerve in front of/anterior to the carpal tunnel
- It gives off a common interosseous artery very near its origin, that courses down the medial side of the arm.
- It forms a superficial palmar arch which will give off superficial branches as well
- The most important branch of the ulnar artery is the common interosseous

### Common Interosseous Artery (Branch of the Ulnar Artery)

- It is quite short
- There is a little gap at the top of the interosseous membrane
- It divides at the top of that gap and creates anterior and posterior interosseous branches which run on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the interosseus membrane to supply the deeper muscles (most of these muscles) of the anterior and posterior compartments of the forearm respectively

# Location of Arterial Pulses of the Forearm

- There are two places where the pulse can be felt:

### 1) The Brachial Pulse

- The tendon for biceps can be found in the cubital fossa
- Just medial to this will be above the brachial artery

### 2) The Radial Pulse

- This is found immediately lateral to the tendon for flexor carpi radialis at the wrist

# Nerves of The Forearm

- The musculocutaneous nerve is effectively finished before it reaches the forearm as it innervated the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm and threw off the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.

### Median Nerve

- This innervates the anterior forearm muscles except flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus
- It descends down the anteromedial aspect of the arm, comes through the cubital fossa and continues down the anteromedial aspect of the arm
- It has 2 branches in the arm:
1. Anterior interosseous branch innervates the deep muscles of the forearm
2. It comes through the carpal tunnel, but throws off one superficial branch (palmar branch) before doing so, which passes over to the Carpal Tunnel 

### Ulnar Nerve

- It is in the posterior compartment of the arm high up, goes round the posterior surface of the medial epicondyle of the humerus and then comes back into the anterior compartment of the arm between the two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris
- It travels down the medial side of the arm with the ulnar artery
- It innervates flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus
- It enters the hand above/superficial to the carpal tunnel
- It mostly innervates muscles of the hand and gives off 2 sensory branches:
1. Dorsal Branch
2. Palmar Branch

### Radial Nerve

- In the arm, it is in the posterior compartment, and just before the elbow it comes to the anterior compartment between brachioradialis and brachialis
- It gives off two branches:
1) The first is a superficial branch that comes down the anterior and lateral branch of the arm - This is sensory to the dorsum of the hand and forearm 
2) It gives off the posterior interosseous branch which goes into the posterior compartment and innervates the muscles of the posterior compartment of the forearm

# Cutaneous Nerves of the Forearm - Covered Previously

- The radial nerve is responsible for sensory innervation of the posterior aspect of the arm and
forearm, as well as the posterior aspect of the lateral part of the hand
- The median nerve is responsible for the sensory innervation of the lateral three and a half digits and palm
- The ulnar nerve is responsible for the sensory innervation of the medial one and a half digits and palm

# Carpal Tunnel and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome

- The carpal tunnel is a gateway between the forearm and hand
- The carpal bones are not in a flat plane, but are arranged in an anteriorly concave arch, which forms the back and the walls of the carpal tunnel
- They are spanned anteriorly, by a thick connective tissue sheet called the flexor retinaculum which attaches to the pisiform and the hook of the hamate medially and the trapezium and scaphoid laterally
- The flexor retinaculum ensures that the tendons remain together within the Carpal Tunnel when the finger/wrist is flexed
- This forms the carpal tunnel

### Contents of the Carpal Tunnel

1. There are the four tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis which go through the carpal tunnel to digits II - V
2. The four tendons of flexor digitorum profundus which go to digits II - V
3. The single tendon of the flexor pollicis longus
4. The median nerve, which is the most anterolateral of the structures
- There are 9 tendons and one nerve
- The 8 tendons of flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis share one synovial cavity and are surrounded by a single synovial sheath, allowing these tendons to glide against one another without generating friction
- The tendon of flexor pollicis longus has its own synovial cavity and sheath
- These synovial cavities help prevent friction of the tendons as they are pulling on the fingers

    ### Structures that Pass Adjacent to the Carpal Tunnel
    
    - Anterolateral to the carpal tunnel is the tendon of flexor carpi radialis
    - Anteromedial to the carpal tunnel there is the ulnar nerve and ulnar artery that pass through their own cavity called the Ulnar Canal/Guyon’s canal (Nerve runs medial to Artery)
    - Extensor Tendons pass into the hand posterior to the Carpal Tunnel
    
    ### Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
    
    - It usually results from overuse and repetitive motion
    - It happens when one of the nine tendons in the carpal tunnel or the synovial sheath begins to swell up and impinge on the median nerve
    - Symptoms involve pain and numbness in the sensory distribution of the median nerve (Lateral 3.5 digits)
    - In severe cases, there is atrophy of the thenar muscles, which is supplied by the median nerve
