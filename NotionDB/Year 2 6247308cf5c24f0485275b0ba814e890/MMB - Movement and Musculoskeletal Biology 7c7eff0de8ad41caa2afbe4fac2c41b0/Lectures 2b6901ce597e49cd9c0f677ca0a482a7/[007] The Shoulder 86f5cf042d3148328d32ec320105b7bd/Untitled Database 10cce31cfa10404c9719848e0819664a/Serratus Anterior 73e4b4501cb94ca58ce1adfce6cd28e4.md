# Serratus Anterior

Action: 1) Protracts and Rotates Scapula                                2) Prevents Winging of the Scapula
Extra Info: - Travels Posteriorly along anterior surface of Ribs and under the Scapula to insert onto Medial border of Scapula.                                       - In 4 Legged Animals, Serratus Anterior acts as a sling to suspend the trunk away from the Limbs. In Upright Humans, it adheres the scapula to the Posterior Rib Cage.                                               - As Long Thoracic Nerve is just deep to skin, it can be easily damaged. Hence, Damage to the Long Thoracic Nerve on one side means that the Scapula on that side is no longer tightly adherent to the Posterior Ribcage causing it to 'wing' away.                                       - This can be seen by asking Px to push against a wall. The winged scapula will then be seen to project Posteriorly as it has winged away from the Rib Cage (See Image)
