Action: Powerful abduction of the arm above 15Â°
Extra Info: - Forms the rounded lateral contour of the shoulder posteriorly and hence, has a curved triangle shape to originate posteriorly and travel anterolaterally around the Humerus to converge onto the Deltoid Tuberosity.                               - If Deltoid or Axillary Nerve becomes damaged, Key signs are wasting of the contour of the shoulder and inability of powerful abduction
Innervation: Axillary Nerve (C5 and C6, but predominantly C6)
Insertion: Deltoid Tuberosity of the Humerus (On Anterolateral Surface)
Origin: Clavicle and Scapula (Opposite Trapezius)
