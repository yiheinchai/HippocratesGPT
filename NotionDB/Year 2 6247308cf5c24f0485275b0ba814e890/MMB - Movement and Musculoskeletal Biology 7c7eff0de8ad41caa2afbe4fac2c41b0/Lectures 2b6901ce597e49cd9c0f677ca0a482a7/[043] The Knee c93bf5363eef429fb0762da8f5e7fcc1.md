# [043] The Knee

# The Knee Joint

- The knee is the largest synovial joint in the body
- The knee is quite an unstable joint, so a lot of the stability comes from surrounding soft tissues
- There are three bones that make up the knee joint:
1. Femur
2. Tibia
3. Fibula (Doesn't actually participate in the Knee Joint directly)

---

# The Femur (Covered Previously)

- This the largest long bone in the body
- On the posterior surface, there is the sharp edge of the linea aspera which divides distally near the Knee Joint to form the medial and lateral supracondylar lines
- Between the two supracondylar lines posteriorly, there is a flat popliteal surface which is related to and forms the floor of the popliteal fossa.
- These supracondylar lines are continuous with the lateral and medial epicondyles
- In contrast to the upper limb, these serve as areas of attachment for the collateral ligaments and for some of the muscles of the leg
- Above the medial epicondyle, there is a mass of bone called the adductor tubercle - This is where the hamstring portion of adductor magnus attaches
- The medial and lateral condyles of the femur are rounded
- They are divided in the back by a deep intercondylar fossa, whilst in the front they are divided by a shallow valley called the patellar surface - This is what articulates with the patella/kneecap
- Viewed from below, the condyles can be seen to form a U or V shape (apex points anteriorly) because they converge at the front but are separated posteriorly, which has implications for what movements are possible at the joint.
- The walls of the Intercondylar Fossa contains facets for the attachment of the Cruciate Ligaments

# Proximal Tibia and Fibula (Covered Previously Briefly)

![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_11.56.48.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_11.56.48.png)

- The tibia is the larger medial bone and the fibula is the smaller lateral bone.
- The Tibia always remains larger at both ends due to its weight-bearing role.
- The tibia articulates with the femur to make up the knee joint.
- It has flattened medial and lateral condyles.
- It has a raised intercondylar area between them called the intercondylar eminence.
- There are a series of tubercles/spines on the intercondylar eminence which act as the attachment point for various ligaments and menisci
- There is a tibial tuberosity on the front of the tibia where the patellar ligament attaches, which is then attached to the patellar and quadriceps tendon
- On the posterior surface of the Tibula, the diagonal/oblique Soleal Line is found, serving as an attachment site for some muscles of the Leg
- The fibula is fairly small, with a head and neck that act as muscular attachment sites
- It has a head that has a circular facet that articulates with the tibia where it bows out laterally
- The fibula does not form part of the knee joint

---

# Patella

- This is sometimes called the kneecap
- It is a sesamoid bone (the largest Sesamoid Bone) which means it forms within tendons
- Sesamoids can occur randomly due to mechanical stimuli
- Some people have them on the foot or fingers. They could potentially change the mechanical
advantage of a muscle or reduce friction of a tendon
- It is a roughly triangular shape bone with the apex pointing inferiorly and a rounded superior border
- It has a rounded anterior surface whilst the posterior surface has two articular facets with join up with the two condyles of the femur
- The quadriceps femoris tendon inserts into the superior surface of the patella
- The patellar ligament comes off the apex (located inferiorly) and inserts onto the tibial tuberosity
- It allows powerful action of the quadriceps tendon over the femur without bruising and damaging/wearing the tendon down the tendon too much

![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.04.15.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.04.15.png)

### Articulating Surfaces of the Femur and Tibia

- The articular surfaces of the femur and tibia are very different and not congruent/complementary as the femur has large rounded condyles whilst the tibia has flattened condyles
- The femoral condyles come together in a rounded U/V shape, and the medial condyle in particular is very curved whilst the lateral condyle is more straight
- This means as you extend/flex the knee, the bones are actually slightly twisting relative to each other and has 3 main consequences:
1. This creates the valgus angle - This is the angle between the femur (which projects inferomedially from the hip), and a vertical line from the patella
2. The head of the femur is on a long and inferomedially angled neck. This along with the joint morphology and twisting of the bones in the lower limb at the knee, means that the femur comes in at an angle, bringing the Knee Caps and Legs closer to the Midline than the Hip Joint and under the Body's Centre of Mass. This allows the feet to be brought closer to the midline of the body, yet the lower part of the leg is still straight and vertical for weight-bearing
3. These aspects also add to the instability of the knee joint provided by the bones within the joint due to this mismatch in articular surfaces. This is compensated for by significant amounts of soft tissues such as the Menisci, Joint membranes and Capsules, Ligaments and associated muscles and tendons.

# Menisci and Membranes of the Knee

- Factors that increase the stability of the knee -  The stability of the knee, like the shoulder, largely comes from the surrounding soft tissue
- There are menisci, synovial and fibrous membranes, ligaments and muscles that go around the knee and their associated tendons

### **Menisci**

- This is a view of the tibia from above, looking at the articular surface of the tibia
- The 2 Menisci (Medial and Lateral) are 2 C-shaped pads (with the C opening medially orientated) made of fibrocartilage and attached to the tibial plateau.
- There are medial and lateral menisci that articulate with the medial and lateral condyles of the tibia and of the femur
- They help to improve the fit between the vastly different articular surfaces of the rounded femoral condyles and the flattened tibial condyles
- They are both joined anteriorly by a transverse ligament
- There are some differences between the menisci:
• The lateral meniscus is fairly loose and not attached to Collateral Ligaments or fibrous membranes, only to the Popliteal Tendon.
• The medial meniscus is joined with the tibial/medial collateral ligament as well as with the fibrous membrane of the knee and is much more firmly attached
- This difference in surrounding attachments means that the Lateral Meniscus is more mobile than the Medial
- The medial meniscus is more oval in shape, whilst the lateral meniscus is more circular

![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.11.47.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.11.47.png)

### Torn Menisci

- The menisci can be torn due to excessive rotation of the femur and tibia relative to each other, particularly on a flexed knee
- The knee is most stable when fully extended, and there is increasing instability when the knee is flexed, particularly when standing on a flexed knee
- Depending on the direction of rotation, either meniscus can tear It is much more common to get a tear of the medial meniscus as it is so tightly joined to the Medial Collateral Ligament and fibrous membrane
- The lateral meniscus is looser so it can take more movement without being damaged
- If there is pain in the Knee upon Lateral Rotation, the Lateral Meniscus is Torn and if there is pain upon Medial Rotation, the Medial Meniscus is torn.
- It can often occur in conjunction with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or torn tibial/medial collateral ligament (MCL)
- If all three occur, this is known as the “unhappy triad” (MENTIONED LATER)

![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.15.31.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.15.31.png)

### Synovial Membrane

- Synovial membrane is attached to the edges of the joint/articular surfaces and the menisci
- The medial meniscus is attached to the fibrous membrane as well
- The synovial membrane is separated from the patellar ligament anteriorly by a thick infrapatellar fat pad which helps cushion the synovial membrane against the patellar ligament
- There are outpockets of the synovial membrane that form bursae to reduce friction between tendons and underlying structures during movement:
1) There is a small subpopliteal recess that is found laterally and cushioned against the tendon of popliteus 
2) There is the large suprapatellar bursa which is between the front of the femur and patella and then travels up - It is an extension of the synovial membrane of the knee joint
- Articularis Genus is attached to Apex of Suprapatellar Bursa to keep it taut during leg extension

[NO NEED TO KNOW NAME OF MUSCLE](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/NO%20NEED%20TO%20KNOW%20NAME%20OF%20MUSCLE%20220c362329554e5aa061ade0a69d055f.md)

- There are some ligaments inside the knee joint which are called the cruciate ligaments:
- These are intra-articular (within the knee joint) and are inside the fibrous membrane
- However, they are not inside the synovial membrane, which reflects off the cruciate ligaments
    
    ![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.25.49.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.25.49.png)
    
- There are other bursae that are outside the joint capsule and not directly connected to the articular cavity of the Knee Joint:
- There are so many large bones and muscles, ample cushioning from multiple Bursae in this area is a necessity
- The prepatellar bursa is subcutaneous - It is between the skin and superficial fascia and the anterior surface of the patella
- On either side of the patella ligament (superficial and Deep to Ligament) below the patella, there are deep (between Ligament and Infrapatella fat pat) and superficial (between Ligament and Skin) infrapatellar bursae
- Again, these are not connected to the synovial membrane of the joint but are separate
- Repeated trauma of these bursae can result in inflammation (bursitis)
- This is particularly common amongst people who have professions that involve kneeling
- Inflammation of the infrapatellar bursa is also known as Clergyman’s knee
- Inflammation of the prepatellar bursa is known as Housemaid’s or Carpet Layer’s knee
    
    ![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.28.26.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.28.26.png)
    

### Fibrous Membrane

- This surrounds the synovial membrane and the entire joint cavity
- Depending on the side of the knee being looked at, it is either attached to or supported by various structures
- Medially, the fibrous membrane is continuous with the medial or tibial collateral ligament as well as the underlying medial meniscus
- Anteriorly, it is attached to patellar ligament, patella and underside of the quadriceps femoris tendon
- Laterally, the fibrous membrane is not attached to the fibular or lateral collateral ligament or the lateral meniscus . However, the iliotibial tract which is the thick band of the fascia lata on the lateral side of the thigh is attached to the fibrous membrane and strengthens it
- Posteriorly, it is supported by the large aponeurosis of the semimembranosus muscle as well by the popliteal tendon which enters the fibrous membrane
- There is additional support anteromedially from the insertions of gracilis, sartorius and semitendinosus (pes anserinus)

![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.30.37.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_12.30.37.png)

# Ligaments of the Knee

- There are two types of ligaments in the knee:
1) Collateral ligaments: These are outside the joint capsule
2) Cruciate ligaments: These are inside the joint capsule

### Collateral Ligaments

- They are found either side of the joint and help to stabilise the hinge-like movement of the Knee Joints.
- Both the Tibial and Fibular Collateral Ligaments are tense during extension of the knee

Medially, there is the larger and broader tibial collateral ligament (MCL):

- It comes off the medial epicondyle of the femur and attaches to the medial and posterior parts of the tibia (just posterosuperior to Pes Anserinus)
- It joins with the fibrous membrane and the medial meniscus
- It limits adduction of the leg

Laterally, there is the smaller (thin and cord-like) fibular collateral ligament

- Which goes from the lateral epicondyle of the femur to the head of the fibula which limits abduction of the Leg
- There are additional supporting structures in the iliotibial tract, tendon of popliteus and the tendon of biceps femoris
- It is not attached to the lateral collateral ligament or the lateral meniscus
    
    ![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_15.55.45.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_15.55.45.png)
    

### Cruciate Ligaments

- These are inside the knee and are called cruciate as they cross each other and are in the shape of an X or cross
- They attach to the inside of the intercondylar fossa:
o The ACL attaches to the lateral wall of the intercondylar fossa and runs to a facet on the anterior intercondylar area of the tibial plateau. It passes Lateral to the PCL
o The PCL attaches to the medial wall of the intercondylar fossa and runs to a faceton the posterior intercondylar area of the tibial plateau. It passes medial to the ACL
- They can limit flexion and extension and stabilise the knee
- Their most important function is to prevent anterior and posterior displacement of the tibia and femur relative to each other
- There is nothing else really on the joint surfaces which prevent the tibia and femur
sliding forward or backward relative to each other
o The ACL prevents anterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur
o The PCL prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur

![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_15.59.51.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_15.59.51.png)

### Drawer Test - Testing the Integrity of the Cruciate Ligaments

- The patient sits with their knee flexed and thigh is held still:
- To test the PCL, you apply pressure posteriorly
- To test the ACL, you pull the leg forward
- If either of these are torn, there will be anterior or posterior sliding of the tibia relative to the femur.
- These are often torn in sports injuries

# Muscles

These also act to support the knee:

- The anterior compartment muscles tend to extend the knee - They include the quadriceps (three vasti and rectus femoris)
- The posterior compartment muscles tend to flex the knee - These are the hamstring muscles (biceps femoris, semimembranosus and semitendinosus)
- Their various different tendons act to support the knee joint
- There are other muscles that cross the knee and go down into the leg
- They act on the knee joint and some form boundaries of the popliteal fossa

# Movements of the Knee and Locking of the Knee

### Movements of the Knee

- Flexion and extension are the main movements that occur at the knee joint as it is a hinge joint
- Flexion is used to test the L5-S2 Myotome and Extension tests L3-L4 Myotome
- The curved medial condyle of the femur means that some lateral and medial rotation of the femur and tibia relative to each other can occur, most significantly when the knee is partially flexed
- This particularly happens with rotation of the femur on a fixed tibia and is very important in locking the knee
    
    ![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_16.55.44.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_16.55.44.png)
    
- Locking the knee is caused by the cruciate ligaments:
- There is no muscle that causes the locking as It is guided by the orientation of the cruciate ligaments
- It is an energy-saving mechanism and is a more efficient way of standing as you minimise the use of muscular force required to maintain the standing posture
- When the knee is flexed, it is unstable as the tibia is in contact with just the back of the rounded tibial condyles
    
    ![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_16.57.24.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_16.57.24.png)
    
- When the knee is in full extension, you maximise the surface area of the Femoral Condyles that is in contact with the tibia and hence, provide most stability to the knee joint
- As you extend your knee, the cruciate ligaments cause medial rotation of the femur on the fixed tibia. It causes the collateral ligaments to tighten and the articular surfaces to move into a stable position
- It brings the centre of mass of the body anterior to the knee and so makes it difficult to flex
- By locking the knee, there is not much muscle activity expended
- The ligaments, however, cannot unlock the knee
- Unlocking is caused by popliteus:
- It laterally rotates the femur relative to the tibia
- This pulls the condyles out of the grooves and releases the collateral ligaments and so the knee unlocks and the centre of mass shifts back over the knee

![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_17.00.37.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_17.00.37.png)

# Knee Joint Injuries

- Due to the instability of the knee joint (because of its ranges of motility and joint structure), it is one of the most frequently injured joints despite the support provided by surrounding soft tissue
- They can occur due to chronic trauma like regularly doing long-distance running
- It also commonly occur more acutely in contact sports like rugby and American football

### Unhappy Triad

- It is caused by a medially directed blow on the lateral side of the knee whilst the foot is fixed on the ground and the knee is partially flexed because that is when the knee is least stable
- It causes three things to happen:
1) Due to the direction of movement, the ACL is torn
2) The MCL is torn due to extreme tension on the medial side
3) As the MCL is attached to the medial meniscus, the medial meniscus is also torn
- Depending on the age of the individual, severity of the injury and how it is treated, this can sometimes be a career-ending injury for athletes as it is fairly drastic

![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_17.03.58.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_17.03.58.png)

# Arteries and Nerves of the Knee

### Arteries

- As with many joints in the body there is a vascular anastomosis around the knee called the genicular anastomosis
- A number of arteries contribute to this, there are branches from:
1) Popliteal artery (femoral artery after having passed through the adductor hiatus)
2) Femoral artery from above
3) Lateral circumflex femoral artery which is a branch of profunda femoris
4) Anterior tibial artery (from the Popliteal Artery)
- Recurrent branches from vessels distal to the knee also contribute to the Genicular Anastamosis
- There are four branches of the popliteal artery which also contribute to the Genicular Anastamosis:
1) These are the superior medial and lateral genicular arteries above the knee joint
2) There are the inferior medial and lateral genicular arteries from below the knee joint

![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_17.11.19.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_17.11.19.png)

### Nerves

- The knee joint can also sense pain and receives innervation from a number of different nerves, including the obturator, femoral, and both terminal branches of the sciatic nerve (tibial and common fibular nerves)

---

# Collateral Blood Flow within the Lower Limb

- The cruciate and genicular anastomosis are connected to each other in various different ways by this vascular network
- This means that even if there is occlusion of the femoral artery, there can still be blood flow lower down into the limb
- If occlusion of the femoral artery occurred before branching of the profunda femoris:
• Blood could flow to the leg (or at least the thigh) via the inferior gluteal artery and cruciate anastomosis
- If occlusion of the femoral artery occurred after the branching of the profunda femoris:
• Blood could flow to the leg via the lateral circumflex femoral artery and genicular anastomosis
- There are lots of contingencies in the event that one branch is occluded

![%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_17.13.08.png](%5B043%5D%20The%20Knee%20c93bf5363eef429fb0762da8f5e7fcc1/Screenshot_2021-07-09_at_17.13.08.png)

# Popliteal Fossa

- This is the second gateway of the lower limb
- It is a diamond-shaped space on the back of the knee

**Boundaries:**

- Superolateral: Biceps femoris
- Superomedial: Semitendinosus and semimembranosus
- Inferolateral: Lateral head of gastrocnemius and plantaris
- Inferomedial: Medial head of gastrocnemius
- Floor: Popliteal surface of the femur and joint capsule (sometimes can find the popliteus muscle itself far down)
- Roof: Skin and fascia

**Contents of the Popliteal Fossa (Medial to Lateral, Deep to Superficial):**

1. The popliteal artery is the deepest and most medial structure - It is the continuation of the femoral artery once it goes through the adductor hiatus
2. The popliteal vein
3. The Tibial nerve - The sciatic nerve normally divides just above the
popliteal fossa into the tibial division and common fibular division but it can occur higher up. The Tibial Nerve descends through the Fossa, deep to Plantaris, and exits to enter the Posterior Compartment of the Leg
4. The common fibular nerve - It is most lateral structure and hides under/follows the margin of the tendon of the biceps femoris, where it swings around the posterior and then lateral surface of the Femur to enter the Lateral Compartment of the Leg

It also contains:

1. Genicular branches coming off the popliteal artery which contribute to the Genicular Anastamosis
2. Lymph Nodes
3. Fat
4. Medial and lateral sural cutaneous branches (branches of the tibial and common fibular respectively) may come off in the popliteal fossa and sometimes be found here

### Roof of the Popliteal Fossa

1. The fascia contains the posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh
2. The small saphenous vein is a small superficial vein coming off the lateral side of the dorsal venous arch. it can commonly be found in the Roof of the Popliteal Fossa, particularly inferiorly. 
- Within the popliteal fossa, it dives down into the fossa and joins the popliteal vein
- The pulse of the popliteal artery can be palpated, however since it is deep one has to push quite hard on the superior part of the popliteal fossa to feel the pulse of the popliteal artery
