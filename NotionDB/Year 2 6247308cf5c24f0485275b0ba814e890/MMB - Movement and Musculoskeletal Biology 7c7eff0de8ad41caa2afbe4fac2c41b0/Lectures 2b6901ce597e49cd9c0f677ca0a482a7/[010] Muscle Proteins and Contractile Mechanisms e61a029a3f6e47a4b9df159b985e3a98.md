# [010] Muscle Proteins and Contractile Mechanisms

# Overview of Muscles

- Whole muscle ‚Üí muscle fascicle (bundle of muscle fibres surrounded by perimysium) ‚Üí single muscle fibre ‚Üí myofibril (long chain of sarcomeres) ‚Üí arrangement of protein filaments that make up sarcomere ‚Üí organisation of actin and myosin to form thick and thin filaments.
- Muscle contraction: A process of moving thin actin filaments into thick myosin filaments, generating muscle tension
    
    The Three Classes of Muscles are:
    
    ### 1) Skeletal
    
    - Connects bones in arms, legs, spine
    - Striated appearance under light microscopy
    - Multinucleate cells bounded by an electrically excitable plasma membrane
    - Each skeletal muscle cell is usually 1-4 mm long
    - It contains many parallel filaments of myofibrils immersed in cytosol
    
    ### 2) Cardiac
    
    - Also striated but found in the heart
    
    ### 3) Smooth:
    
    - Surrounds intestines, uterus, large blood vessels

# Sarcomere

- Functional unit of muscle
- Repeats every 2300 nm along the long axis of the muscle fibre
- Each thick filament (myosin) is 15 nm in diameter
- Each thin filament (actin) is 9 nm in diameter
- Cross-bridges from thick filaments bridge a 13 nm gap to thin filament (bridges the gap between the filaments)
- A band: appears dark under polarising light, so called anisotropic. This is where myosin/thick filaments are found
- I band: appears light under polarising light, so called isotropic. This is where actin/thin filaments are found
- Z line: divides each I band. The region between 2 Z lines is the sarcomere
- H zone: paler area in centre of A band (either side of the M line). This is the region where the thick and thin filaments do not overlap so only Thick filaments are found.
- M line: This is found in the centre of each H zone/A Band. Here, links are formed between adjacent thick/myosin filaments by proteins of cytoskeleton.
- Thick filaments arranged in a regular hexagonal order surrounded by hexagonal array of thin filaments.

# Sliding Filament Theory of Muscle Contraction

- Contractile proteins make up 60% of striated muscle protein:
o Myosin: 33%
o Actin: 14%
o Tropomyosin: 3.5%
o Troponin: 3.5%
- Remaining 40% includes enzymes for energy metabolism
- Biggest human protein, Titin, is 34,350 AA long. 274 Ig and 264 Fn domains.
- It Spans half-length of sarcomere and connects the Z lines of adjacent Sarcomeres.
- Muscles shorten by up to 33% of original length on contraction:
- Length of thick myosin and thin actin filaments do not alter on contraction
- Sarcomere shortens due to overlapping of thick and thin filaments, which slide over each during during contraction
- During muscle contraction, the Z lines move closer together, causing the sarcomere and I bands to shorten whilst the A band remains the same length
- Force of contraction is generated by active process of moving one filament past neighbouring filaments of the other type

### What Happens in Muscle Contraction?

- ATP-Dependent interactions between the Myosin Heads and Actin causes the Myosin Heads (cross-bridges) to 'walk' down the fixed actin filaments
- Myosin is a motor protein - a 'mechanochemical enzyme'

# Myosin-II

### Myosin-II In Striated Muscle

- Makes up nearly whole of thick myofilaments
- Very Large protein with Mol. Wt. 520,000 and has 6 subunits
- About 10 different myosins are known
- It can be extracted and purified from muscle mince using high ionic strength (0.5 M ùêæùê∂ùëô)

### Primary Structure of Myosin-II

- Contains 2 copies of each of the 3 different proteins
- Heavy chain: subdivides into
1) LMM (light meromyosin) (fibrous): forms rods by self-association with another copy of the myosin molecule - This forms the main length/tail of the myosin
2) S2 (fibrous) - Found between the main Myosin chain and the Head. This binds to the 2 Light Chains
3) S1 (globular): This is the tip/head and contains ATP-binding site, an actin binding site and light chain binding site.
- Light chain 1: RLC (regulatory light chain) - Closer to LMN
- Light chain 2: ELC (essential light chain) - Closer to S2
- Light Chains are relatively small in contrast to the Heavy Chain and are involved in contraction depending on the environment of the muscle

### Secondary Structure of Myosin-II

- LMM of heavy chain contains 2 ùõº-helices coiled around each other at 3.5 residues per turn (not 3.6 as is found in Œ±-helices)
- This unique number of residues per turn means that Hydrophobic AAs are packed specially at the contact points between the helices, which attract each other to hold the ùõº-helices together
- Electrically charged resides are on outside, with the attraction of these residues to one another stabilising LMN
- the LMN segment is 170 nm

### Tertiary Structure of Myosin-II

- S1 is globular and contains binding sites for ATP and actin
- S1 is 17 nm long
- S1 has 2 special features:
1) ATPase site and actin site are on opposite sides of N-terminal end (ATP Binding on superior surface, same side as RLC, and Actin binding on inferior surface of S1, near the tip) 
2) Long neck region which extends into S2. RLC and ELC light chains bind here (ELC more distally than RLC)

### Quarternary Structure of Myosin-II

- Overall appearance is a thick filament, shown in EM
- It is filamentous, with a head-free central region with the S1 Myosin Heads found at either side of the filament

# Actin in Striated Muscle

- Most abundant intracellular protein (in all cells)
- Major protein of thin filament
- Monomer of mol. Wt. 42,000 (small molecule)
- 2 forms:
1) G-actin (globular): monomeric form that is found in solutions at low ionic strength
2) F-actin (fibrous): exists in thin filaments as coiled coil, and forms thin filaments in muscle. When ionic strength ‚Üë to physiological level, G-actin polymerises to form F-actin via Nucleation (G actin clumps together) and Elongation (G-Actin extends clump to make it linear and fibrous) to reach the final F-Actin steady state

![Screenshot 2021-08-29 at 19.52.30.png](%5B010%5D%20Muscle%20Proteins%20and%20Contractile%20Mechanisms%20e61a029a3f6e47a4b9df159b985e3a98/Screenshot_2021-08-29_at_19.52.30.png)

- F-Actin has a helical structure that repeats itself after 13 subunits
- Appearance of 2 strings of beads that are wound around each other
- Each subunit touches 4 others
- ATP binds to actin to accelerate F-actin formation
- In all cells, actin filaments provide a lattice that supports the plasma membrane and organises the cytosol.
- In muscle, the Actin Filaments provide the tracks for myosin to move along
- Angel of death mushrooms contain a cyclic peptide toxin called phalloidin which locks F-actin fibres together, causing paralysis

# Muscle Contraction and Its 4 Stages

- Motion created by coupling ATP binding to the S1 head with actin binding to the S1 head.
- Allosteric conformational changes take place in S1 to produce the movement of the S1 head down the Thin Actin Filament.
- 2 hinges in myosin, between S1 and S2 (for motion), and between S2 and LMM (to assist S1 binding to actin).

### 4 Stages of Muscle Contraction

1. ATP binding 
- In absence of bound ATP, myosin binds actin tightly as Actin-Binding Cleft is closed while ATP-Cleft is open.
- When ATP binds, it closes the ATP-cleft on one side of the S1 head, which opens actin-binding cleft on the other side of the S1 head, so weakening binding of the S1 head to actin.
- Myosin then dissociates from actin.
1. ATP hydrolysis
- In the S1 head that is no longer bound to Actin, ATP is hydrolysed to ADP + Pi but they are not yet released.
- This causes ATP-cleft to close, and S1 bends its shape (nods forward) ready to bind to actin again (weakly) further down the Thin Filament
1. Release of phosphate
- Release of Pi from myosin whilst ADP is still bound causes myosin to bind strongly to Actin.
1. Release of ADP
- Loss of ADP from ATP-cleft causes S1 head to swivel/pivot and straighten up (flick back) back to its starting position, when it can bind tightly to actin.
- In course of this conformational change (power stroke) due to ADP release, neck and tail of myosin shifts along actin filament by 10 nm (or 2 actin monomers).
- No ATP, myosin head bound to actin. ATP binds, releases myosin head. ATP dissociates into ADP + Pi, myosin head moves to new position. Loss of Pi causes strong binding of myosin head to actin. Loss of ADP causes power stroke.

# The Role of Calcium with Tropomyosin and Troponin

### Role of Tropomyosin in Striated Muscle

- 40 nm long 2-stranded ùõº-helix rod with 7 actin binding sites that is aligned  between the 2 helices in the thin filament of F-actin
- Mol. Wt. 70,000
- Makes up 33% of weight of thin filament
- Regulatory protein which blocks S1 binding to actin when [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] is low
- A 5th stage in muscle contraction is essential to control contraction. In absence of ATP, myosin does not interact with actin unless inhibition from 2 other proteins (tropomyosin and
troponin - physically block the S1 head from binding to actin-binding site) is switched off by a transient rise in [Ca¬≤‚Å∫]
- In resting (relaxed) muscle, calcium is sequestered in sarcoplasmic reticulum.
- Ca-ATPase pump lowers [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] in muscle cytoplasm to less than 1 ùúáM.
- Nerve impulse releases calcium to cytosol, turning off the inhibition of myosin-actin cross-bridge formation by Tropomyosin and Troponin, leading to muscle contraction.

### Role of Troponin in Striated Muscle

- Complex of 3 small regulatory proteins attached to thin filament and tropomyosin:
1. Troponin C:
o Mol. wt. 18,000
o Binds Ca¬≤‚Å∫ at 2 sites. When this happens, there is an allosteric conformational change of TnC that is transmitted to its neighbours (troponin I and troponin T).
2. Troponin I:
o Mol. wt. 24,000
o Binds Actin and blocks Myosin-Binding site when [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] is low
3. Troponin T:
o Mol. wt. 37,000
o Binds tropomyosin and controls positioning of tropomyosin on actin filament
- If heart attack suspected, test patient‚Äôs blood for free troponin. Heart cells that are destroyed release troponin so raised Cardiac Troponin is an indicator of an MI.
- When [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] is high, Ca¬≤‚Å∫ binds to TnC. This causes TnC to change conformation, which is transmitted to TnI and TnT, causing Tropomyosin to shift away from the actin and exposing the Myosin-Binding site on the Actin.
- This allows the S1 Head to bind and form a cross-bridge with the Myosin

# Striated Vs Skeletal Muscle

- Smooth muscle does not have striations and is under involuntary control of CNS
- Filaments not organised into well-ordered sarcomeres, but instead into loose bundles of thick and thin filaments at dense bodies in cytosol
- Contraction occurs by the same sliding filament mechanism as in striated muscle, but is less ordered

---

# Control of Striated and Smooth Muscle Contraction

- Smooth muscle contains tropomyosin but no troponin.
- Control of contraction (actin-myosin binding) occurs by different regulatory mechanisms (unlike striated muscles which are controlled only by nerves)
- An increase in cytosolic [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] signals contraction in both striated and smooth muscle
- In smooth muscle, calcium phosphorylates the thick filament to allow contraction
- This operates more slowly (from seconds to minutes) than in
striated muscle

There are 4 pathways of controlling smooth muscle contraction:

1. Caldesmon (mol. Wt. 150,000; length 75 nm)
- When [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] low, Caldesmon forms a complex with tropomyosin and actin, which restricts myosin binding to actin.
1. Phosphorylation by kinases (including protein kinase C)
- When Caldesmon is phosphorylated, Caldesmon cannot bind to actin thin filament, and cannot inhibit myosin binding to actin.
1. Myosin light chain kinase: 
- MLC-K Phosphorylates RLC, bound to the S1 head.
- Unphosphorylated RLC inhibits actin stimulation of myosin ATPase activity preventing ATP Hydrolysis by the S1 Head.
- Calcium is needed to activate Myosin Light Chain Kinase, which it does by first binding to calmodulin.
- The Ca-Calmodulin complex then binds to RLC to activate it to stimulate Myosin ATPase activity.
- When RLC is phosphorylated, inhibition is removed.
1. Humoral factors (e.g. hormones): activate or inhibit contraction

# The Properties and 4 Roles of Calcium in the Muscle

### Properties of Calcium in Muscle

- Can coordinate 6-8 oxygen atoms in asymmetric complexes and therefore, cross-link different segments of a protein and induce large conformational changes.
- It is therefore an intracellular messenger in many eukaryotic signal transducing pathways (examples include vision, phophoinositide cascade, regulation of muscle contraction).
- All cells have rapid Ca¬≤‚Å∫ extrusion mechanisms (Sarcolemmal Ca¬≤‚Å∫-ATPase and Na‚Å∫/Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Exchanger) to closely regulate its [ ] due to its effects on signalling and protein conformation
- [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] must be kept low at about 100 nM to prevent the formation of insoluble Calcium Phosphate (Bone) inside cells ([Pi] is also kept low to prevent this).
- Abrupt ‚Üë in cytosolic [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] through calcium channels causes large magnitude increase in [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] and so can be used for signalling.

### 4 Roles of Calcium in Muscles

1. Triggers contraction in striated muscles 
- It causes thin filaments to
rearrange structurally so thick and thin filaments interact with each other, Myosin ATPase is activated and filament interdigitations occurs.
1. Triggers contraction in smooth muscles
- It does so by complexing with calmodulin and activating myosin light chain kinase to phosphorylate regulatory light chain (RLC) causing myosin-actin interactions.
1. Ensures sealing of sarcolemma of striated muscle fibres
- This is so the sarcolemmal membrane does not spontaneously leak Na‚Å∫ or K‚Å∫ and depolarise.
- This is essential for neural control of skeletal muscle contraction.
- Tetanus toxin and alkalosis both permeabilise the sarcolemma, leading to Na‚Å∫ or K‚Å∫ leakage and depolarisation, resulting for unprogrammed, continuous contraction (Tonic Paralysis).
1. In < 1s, 5 nM Ca¬≤‚Å∫ partially activates phosphorylase kinase in striated muscle
- This initiates glycogenolysis from exactly as work begins, and gives the muscle partial access to these large muscle glycogen stores to generate ATP for muscle contraction.
- Glycogen is main initial fuel for all unrehearsed work.
