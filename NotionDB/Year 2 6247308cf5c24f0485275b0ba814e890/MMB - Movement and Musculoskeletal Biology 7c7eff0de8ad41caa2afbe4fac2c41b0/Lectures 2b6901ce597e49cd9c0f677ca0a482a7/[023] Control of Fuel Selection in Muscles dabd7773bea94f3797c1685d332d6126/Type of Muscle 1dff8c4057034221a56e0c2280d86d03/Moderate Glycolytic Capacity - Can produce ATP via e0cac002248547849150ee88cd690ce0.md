# Moderate Glycolytic Capacity - Can produce ATP via Glycolysis with Glucose but also via TCA and ETC using FAs. Therefore, as they can generate ATP via other processes, they do not need such a high Glycolytic Capacity

Type II: High Glycolytic Capacity - Sugar acts as the primary fuel source to provide the Large amount of ATP required to fuel the strong muscular contractions
