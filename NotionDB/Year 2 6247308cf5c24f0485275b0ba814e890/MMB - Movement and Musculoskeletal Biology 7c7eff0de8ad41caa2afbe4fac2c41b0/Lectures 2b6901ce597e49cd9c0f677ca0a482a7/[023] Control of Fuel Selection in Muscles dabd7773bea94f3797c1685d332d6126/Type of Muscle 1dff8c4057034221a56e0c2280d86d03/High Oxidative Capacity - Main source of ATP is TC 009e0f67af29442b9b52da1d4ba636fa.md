# High Oxidative Capacity - Main source of ATP is TCA and ETC (Aerobic Processes) so High Oxidative Capacity is needed to produce the ATP needed for muscular Contractions

Type II: Low Oxidative Capacity - As Glycolysis is main source of ATP and this process is Anaerobic, a High Aerobic Capacity is not needed to produce ATP
