# [036] Cell and Molecular Biology of Bone

# Skeleton

- 9% of body bulk.
- 17% of body weight.
- Bone is highly vascular, receiving 7-8% of CO.
- Blood Vessels pierce the cortex, marrow (between trabecular elements) and the trabecular bone
- Good blood supply allows for greater cellularity than in cartilage, enabling remodelling and repair.
- Bone is also innervated by nerve fibres associated with blood vessels.
- This is in contrast to cartilage which is avascular and primitive.
- Vascular channels easily seen in bones as a regular array of very small holes in the cortex/cortical bone.

- Developing Adult teeth develop within the jaw, surrounded by a layer of Alveolar Bone

- Developing outer tooth has superficial layer of Enamel, synthesised by layer of Columnar Ameloblasts found just superior to the enamel
- Superficial enamel layer is attached to a deeper Dentine later (supporting tissue of the tooth)
- Surrounding the tooth is Alveolar Bone, with a concavity into which the developing adult tooth grows

### Osteoclasts

- These are large multinucleate cells that resorb bone
- In teeth, They are found on the edges of the Developing Tooth, in depressions (formed via OC activity) between the tooth and the Alveolar Jaw Bone.
- Here, they resorb Alveolar Bone to allow for the Developing Tooth to travel superiorly and erupt out of the gum

### Osteoblasts

- In teeth, there are organised into a single layer at the edges of the Alveolar Bone, synthesising Osteoid/Bone Matrix (Unmineralised bone)

### Osteocytes

- Osteoblasts that have become embedded within the bone matrix that they have synthesised
- They are connected to one another via Canaliculi and coordinate the activity of OCs and OBs
- Overall activity of OCs and OBs means that Alveolar Bone appears to migrate superficially

# Osteoblasts and Osteocytes

### Osteoblasts

- Bone forming cuboidal cells of mesenchymal origin embryologically (i.e. connective tissue cells).
- Secrete organic matrix of bone (90% collagen type I) which is initially unmineralised. (Osteoid)
- They mineralise deeper Osteoid with Ca₄(PO₄)₃(OH) (hydroxyapatite).
- Active or inactive (flattened) osteoblasts cover most bone surfaces.
- Bone is always covered by cells and controlled by these, naked bone is only found in regions where Bone Necrosis has occurred
- In adult life when bones have reached their desired size and shape, Active Osteoblasts flatten out, to cover the bone surface
- Some get incorporated into matrix and differentiate to form osteocytes, a network of strain-detecting cells present within all living bone.

### Osteocytes - Cells resident in bone/trapped in matrix that it
secretes

- Communicate with each other and with osteoblasts via fine canaliculi.
- Detect strain in bone (i.e. deformation) resulting from mechanical loading, signalling to Osteoblasts on the Periosteal surface to synthesise more bone to reduce strain/deformation of the bone under mechanical loading.
- Ability to detect strain enables remodelling to occur, that adapts bone to mechanical loads (e.g. thicker bones in tennis player arms).
- Max. strain normally experienced by bone is about 1 part in 300 (doesn't bend much, only 0.03%, as it is mineralised).
- If bone strain exceeds this, the bone is a risk of fracturing due to its high mineralisation
- Maximum stimulation of OBs due to Osteocyte activity occurs at the maximum threshold of normal strain, generated usually during sudden impact loading.
- A lack of mechanical loading on bone (reduced strain) leads to Osteocytes increasing OC recruitment, increasing bone resorption to restore normal strain

- Osteoblasts pile up upon one another during growth and begin to synthesise Osteoid, which then becomes Mineralised to form Trabecular Bone

# Bone Matrix

- Bone is a composite material.
- Organic component is 90% type I collagen (structural protein providing strength, flexibility).
- Remaining 10% of organic component is complex mixture of proteins, including growth factors, osteocalcin (used as a bone marker), osteonectin, osteopontin, glycoproteins.
- All produced by osteoblasts, along with type I collagen.
- Organic matrix is mineralised by osteoblasts only after it has been secreted (unmineralised matrix is osteoid), quite rapidly in the young and quite slowly in adults.
- Mineral component is hydroxyapatite, tiny crystals impregnate and surround collagen fibres to provide rigidity/strength and resistance to compression.
- Mineralisation of osteoid is dependent on hormonally active form of Vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D), to ensure adequate Ca²⁺ uptake from the Gut.
- Vitamin D deficiency results in failure to mineralise:
- Children: rickets
- Adults: osteomalacia

# Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and Mineralisation

- Expressed at high levels on surface of differentiated osteoblasts and is required for bone mineralisation.
- Released into ECM and circulation.
- It release inorganic phosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) from diverse molecules via hydrolysis.
- Promotes mineralisation (i.e. precipitation of calcium phosphate/hydroxyapatite in 2 ways):
1. ↑ local concentration of inorganic phosphate ions.
2. Hydrolysing pyrophosphate, key inhibitor of mineralisation in tissues (also generates more inorganic phosphate) - This is very important in Bone Mineralisation. 
- To mineralise, must get rid of pyrophosphate.

# Osteoclasts (OC)

- Bone is the only tissue that contains cells dedicated to its own destruction
- Multinucleated, motile bone resorbing cells.
- Formed by fusion of pro monocytic precursors present in marrow and circulation (highly differentiated WBC - Hence ability to resorb bone = Modified Phagocytosis and be motile).
- Specialised organ of resorption (ruffled border), found adjacent to bone surface.
- Ruffled border pumps acid (via H⁺-ATPase) to dissolve bone mineral and enzymes (mainly cathepsin K) to degrade collagenous matrix, which can then be resorbed.

![Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 16.18.51.png](%5B036%5D%20Cell%20and%20Molecular%20Biology%20of%20Bone%20f73b28010b9f4f9591ad1b84d7bb3cf7/Screenshot_2021-10-09_at_16.18.51.png)

- Osteoclasts come from myeloid precursors.
- They become preosteoclasts before becoming multinucleated quiescent osteoclasts, which either become activated or apoptotic after they have performed their function/when quiescent
- Apoptosis of Osteoclast is important to prevent excessive bone resorption so Osteoclast are susceptible to the activation of Apoptotic Pathways
- Quiescent Osteoclasts become activated upon contact with the bone surface/due to activating signals, resulting in the formation of the Ruffled Border

### How do Osteoclasts Resorb Bone?

1. Osteoclasts attach themselves to the bone surface via the Sealing Zone
2. Osteoclasts take in CO₂ that reacts with H₂O via carbonic anhydrase II to form Carbonic Acid, which dissociated to form bicarbonate ions. 
3. Bicarbonate ions are pumped out of cell in exchange for Cl⁻ ions.
4. Osteoclast then release Cl⁻ onto bone surface (diffuse across ruffled border) that then react with H⁺ released via H⁺-ATPase to form HCl, which digests the Hydroxyapatite. 
5. Cathepsin K (stored within vesicles) is secreted across the Ruffled Border onto the bone surface, where it digests Type I Collagen
6. Digested Collagen is resorbed and secreted across the basolateral membrane into the Extracellular Space, where it is further degraded by Collagenase
- Osteoclasts work very quickly and continuously as it migrates: bone resorption is faster than formation.

# Bone Surface Remodelling

- When microcracks occur in bone, trabeculae between Osteocytes have been broken. severing connections between these cells. leading to osteocyte apoptosis
- Osteocyte Apoptosis leads to the release of signals into the extracellular fluid, causing osteoclast (promonocytic) precursors in blood to extravasate, differentiate and fuse together to form Osteoclasts which articulate with surface on damaged bone.
- Differentiated osteoclasts then resorb bone in the damaged area.
- New osteoblasts then line the newly resorbed area and begin forming new bone matrix that is later mineralised to repair the microcrack.
- Some osteoblasts then get buried within the Matrix to form new Osteocytes, connected via Trabeculae
- Bone Remodelling only occurs on the surface of Bone

# Bone Remodelling in Trabecular and Cortical Bone

1. Damage to Trabecular Bone causes the release of signals which leads to the formation and activation of new Osteoclasts from Precursors
2. These resorb the damaged area of Trabecular Bone to form a Cavity, which is repaired by Newly differentiated Osteoblasts
3. New Osteoid is laid down in a different orientation to that of the original bone in order to increase the structural integrity of the bone and reduce the risk of large fracture planes
4. After the repair of the damaged region, Osteoblasts flatten out to form Bone Lining Cells that protect the Periosteal Surface
- Sometimes, the Pit created by OC Activity might not be completely filled by OBs in situations of reduced mechanical loading of bone (Detected by Resident Osteocytes).
- In situations of repetitive, heavy loading of bones, the pit created by OC activity might be completely filled by OBs which secrete excessive bone, resulting in net bone formation to increase the strength of the bone
- Both of these scenarios of Bone Remodelling can lead to size and shape changes to damaged bone
- For Cortical Bone, Signals that Activate the Remodelling Cycle causes the migration of OCs from Blood Vessels that run through the Haversian Systems of Cortical Bone
- These differentiate and begin to rapidly (1-2 weeks) excavate a tunnel along the long axis of the bone. which is slowly (years) filled by OBs laying down concentric circles of new bone moving centrally

# Remodelling in Cortical Bone (Tunnelling)

- OB formation of concentric rings of bone to fill the tunnels excavated by OCs creates characteristic appearance of Cortical Bone, where in TS, you can see overlapping concentric circles of Bone (Haversian Systems)

![Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 16.27.22.png](%5B036%5D%20Cell%20and%20Molecular%20Biology%20of%20Bone%20f73b28010b9f4f9591ad1b84d7bb3cf7/Screenshot_2021-10-09_at_16.27.22.png)

- Haversian Systems = Osteons = Concentric Rings of Cortical Bone (formed via Remodelling), with a central Transverse Hav Canal, through which blood vessels supplying the Cortical Bone run
- The newer the Haversian System, the larger the Central Transverse Canal is
- Within Haversian Systems, there is regular organisation of the Canaliculi, projecting centrally towards the Transverse Canal and Lamellae which run around the circumference of the rings
- Along the circumference of the concentric rings, the lacunae which house OCs can be seen (these are flattened oval regions that stain darker than the other regions of the Haversian System)
- Osteocytes have the greatest SA of contact with cells and hence, are specialised to their sensory function within the bone

# Bone Turnover Rates

- Adult human cortical bone is replaced entirely every 15 years.
- Turnover rate in trabecular (cancellous) bone is 10 x greater because of high surface area.
- Therefore, effects of remodelling imbalances appear much sooner in skeletal sites with a high proportion of trabecular bone (e.g. vertebral bodies).
- Bone Remodelling/Turnover is required for:
1. Damage (Micro/Macrofracture)
2. Maintenance of Bone Integrity (Prevents accumulation of older and weakened bone with microfractures) 
3. Altered Mechanical Requirements
4. Calcium Deficit
5. Ageing/Menopause
6. Pathological (Hyperparathyroidism, Cancers, Acidosis)
7. Growth Requirements
