# [014] Limb Development

# Overview

- Week 4 - Limb is present as a paddle, with no fingers
- Week 6 - Forelimb is quite well-defined, with digits visible that are connected by webs of skin.
- The Hindlimb has formed by this time but distinct digits are not yet visible
- Development of the Hindlimb is initiated and continues just behind that of the Forelimb
- Week 11 - Digits of the forelimb are separated now

# Model Organisms - NYC

- Chick (Gallus gallus): large eggs with large embryos and large limb buds, making surgical operations easy.
- Mouse (Mus musculus): eggs and embryos smaller, and inaccessible in uterus of mother.
- Surgical procedures with these eggs are very difficult but they have better genetics than chicks and ability to mutate genes in tissue-specific manner.
- Mouse embryos are important models because many genes in limb development are involved earlier in development, such as gastrulation, and would lead to early death if mutated in all cells.

# Skeletal Elements of the Human Arm

- Scapula and clavicle not part of the upper limb
- All tetrapod limbs have the same basic structure, with 3 axes:
1. Proximal-distal axis: shoulder to tips of fingers. This runs in the sagittal plane
2. Anterior-posterior axis: anterior (thumb), posterior (little finger). This runs in the coronal plane.
- It is also present more proximally in the limb (forearm etc.) but is poorly defined here in comparison to the hand
1. Dorsal-ventral axis: dorsal (back of hand), ventral (palm of hand). This runs in the transverse/axial plane
- These axis develop mainly independent of one another but there is some crossover (E.g SHH involved in development of Anterior-Posterior Axis and Proximal-Distal Axis)

# Human Limb Defects

- Congenital limb malformations occur in 0.1-0.2% of live births (1:500 to 1:1000)
- One of the more common congenital abnormalities as limbs are not required for fetal developments, so defects to limb development will not affect the wider development of the fetus
- Their impacts on function manifest post-birth but do not affect the fetus in utero

### Grieg Syndrome

1. Polydactyly (additional post-axial (little finger) digit coming off the little finger)
2. Syndactyly - 2nd and 3rd fingers (commonly) remain fused
- It is caused by a mutation in GLI3 gene (important in SHH
pathway)
- It shows an Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.
- Also causes defects in the development of the head and face

### Aspert Syndrome

1. Syndactyly 
- This is caused by a mutation in FGFR2 gene (receptor for FGF Signalling molecules).
- It shows an Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern
- Also associated with developmental defects of the head, mainly Craniosynostosis - Premature fusion of the Cranial Sutures

### Holt-Oram Syndrome

1. Phocomelia (↓ in length of long bones of arm, often the radius and ulna)
2. Defects in digits (carpals and metacarpals)
3. Defects in scapula and clavicle, and 75% of affected individuals have atrial septal defect.
- This is caused by a mutation in TBX5 gene.
- Affects the heart as well as Tbx5 is needed for the development and remodelling of the outflow tract of the heart
- It shows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.
- Greig and Apert Syndrome can affect both the upper and lower limbs whereas Holt-Oram Syndrome can only affect the upper limb (as Tbx5 is only expressed in forelimb)

### Congenital Clubfoot

- Caused by mutation in TBX4 (and in PITX1)

### Small Patella Syndrome

- Caused by mutation in TBX4

### Thalidomide

- Given to pregnant women (1956 1961) to control morning sickness.
- It was previously used as a mild-sedative
- Many babies whose mothers were given Thalidomide were born with previously rare congenital phocomelia
- It was previously believed that drugs could not cross placenta to foetus, this clearly proved this wrong due to the effects of Thalidomide (taken by the mother) on the baby
- It can affect either arm, or leg, or both together, Depending on when drug is taken by the mother
- Main effects of Thalidomide on Babies are:
1. Heart defects
2. Deformed Ears and Eyes, causing Blindness and Deafness
3. Deformed alimentary and urinary tract
- Thalidomide is still used toda to treat multiple myeloma and leprosy
- It is believed to bind to major groove of DNA, inhibiting genes (IGF1 and FGF2) that are required for formation of new blood vessels.
- Limb defects may result from cell death caused by poorly
developed limb vasculature.

# Limb Buds

- They form on Day 24 (forelimb), and Day 28 (hindlimb)
- They are comprised of an cuboidal epidermal jacket/surrounding layer of epidermis enclosing mesenchyme formed from lateral plate mesoderm (specifically somatopleuric layer which forms bones, tendons, ligaments, dermis, muscle sheath and blood vessels)
- Mesoderm in the central portion of the limb bud divides more rapidly than that at the proximal and distal ends of the Lateral Plate Mesoderm within the bud (due to exposure to High [FGF]), causing the limb to curve and form a bud
- At the distal end/tip of limb bud. a ridge of Columnar Cells forms, called the Apical Ectodermal Ridge (AER)
- AER releases FGF, promotes proliferation of mesenchymal cells

# Forelimb or Hindlimb?

- T box (transcription factors with DNA binding domains)
- TBX5 only transcribed in upper limb/forelimb
- TBX4 only transcribed in lower limb/hindlimb
- Some TBX4 is also expressed in the heart
- Tbx4 mutations have been linked to congenital clubfoot and small patella syndrome
- There is differential gene expression here to help create the different forelimb and hindlimb morphologies

---

# Skeletal Differentiation (Proximal-Distal)

- Limb bud mesenchyme proliferates rapidly, driving growth along proximal-distal axis.
- Humerus (femur) differentiates first, then radius and ulna (tibia and fibula), carpals (tarsals), metacarpals (metatarsals) and finally phalanges (bones of the limb differentiate/form sequentially moving distally).
- Initially, the skeletal elements of the limb are formed as cartilage framework, which is slowly replaced by bone to form the skeletal elements via Endochondral Ossification
- Cells furthest away from AER proliferate slower than the cells nearest to AER, and differentiate (less FGF).
- Digit 4 usually differentiates first, then 3, 2, and finally 1 and 5.

# Limb Muscle is Formed by the Myotome Region of Somites

- All skeletal muscle from paraxial mesoderm (somites), including muscle cells of limb
- Paraxial cells (Skeletal muscle precursors) migrate laterally into limb (5th week) from the somite, around precursors of bone and differentiate to form ventral and dorsal muscles.
- The dorsal muscle mass forms the extensors and supinators of the forelimb and the extensors and abductors of the hindlimb
- The ventral muscle mass forms the flexors and pronators of the forelimb and the flexors and adductors of the hindlimb
- Myotome cells move into the limb because mesenchyme cells  of the limb bud secrete hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which binds to HGF receptor CMET on the Myotome cells
- Mutation to HGF or CMET/HGF Receptor results in no muscle cells within the limbs (mice)

# Innervation of the Limb

- Motor Neurons to the limb muscles arise from the lateral motor column of the CNS that is adjacent to the developing muscles.
- The Ventral/Flexor Muscle mass is innervated by the Medial Division of this Lateral Motor Column whereas the Dorsal/Extensor Muscle Mass is innervated by the Lateral Division of the Lateral Motor Column
- Limb muscles are not responsible for attracting axons to the limb bud, but they do regulate the final branching pattern in the limb
- The Lateral Motor Column is much larger in the spinal cord segment where motor neurons that innervate the limbs arise from
- Limb Vasculature invades the limb first, with the nerves following the route set up by the vasculature so it is thought that the Limb Vasculature is what is attracting the vasculature into the limb bud
- Forelimb innervation: C5-T2
- Hindlimb innervation: L4-S3

---

# Synapse Formation

- During embryonic and fetal development, multiple motor neurons will innervate a single myotube
- However, all but one of these axons is retracted soon after birth
- The mechanism by which polyneural innervation is eliminated and reduced down to mononeural innervation is not known
- The most active synapse is always retained as it has outcompeted the others

# Apoptosis of the Interdigital Region

- Digits are initially all connected by flaps of skin.
- To separate the digits, apoptosis of the interdigital skin flaps are required.
- Apoptosis is more restricted in ducks (webbed feet), chickens have non-webbed feet.
- Apoptosis is regulated/controlled by bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), that are only active in the interdigital region and hence, only cause apoptosis here.
- BMP found in interdigital mesenchyme, where it causes apoptosis
- Interdigitial Apoptosis does not occur earlier as when Limb Bud outgrowth is occurring, the Interdigital Regions express Gremlin, inhibiting BMP and preventing BMP-Mediated Apoptosis here.
- Noggin and Gremlin (both BMP inhibitors) found in digits themselves, preventing BMP-Mediated Apoptosis here

---

# Syndactyly

- Most common congenital abnormality of hand (0.5% of births/1:2000)
- 2 or more digits fused together, most commonly Digits 3 and 4
- Usually, the same digits are fused both in the upper and lower limb
- Caused by defective apoptosis in interdigital region

# Molecular Mechanisms

### AER - Required for Limb Outgrowth

- Removal of AER ceases limb growth immediately (mesenchyme stops growing), creating a distally truncated/shortened limb, lacking the more distal skeletal elements (only proximal skeletal elements differentiate)
- Truncation is more severe the earlier AER is removed as due to the proximal-distal direction of skeletal differentiation (Early removal of the AER means the more distal skeletal elements that form after the proximal elements fail to form)
- As cell proliferation decreases in limb bud mesenchyme following AER removal, suggesting AER is a source of a mitogen (stimulates mitosis) responsible for promoting cell division in limb bud mesenchyme

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 15.03.41.png](%5B014%5D%20Limb%20Development%209ae733ccf9db40fa8e471b6d46ac9e58/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_15.03.41.png)

### FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) - Essential for Limb Outgrowth

- 4 different FGF genes are expressed in AER. They are required for proximal-distal patterning and skeletal differentiation
- Removing AER stops cell proliferations as FGF stimulating cell proliferation is removed.
- The AER can therefore be replaced by implanting beads containing FGF between the Mesenchyme and Epidermis (where AER should be), which stimulate cell proliferation in the limb bud mesenchyme to promote limb outgrowth and differentiation.
- Whilst the control bead resulted in the formation of a truncated limb, whose length corresponds at the time frame at which the AER was removed, the FGF Beads resulted in the formation of less truncated limb
- Some truncation still occurs as all the FGF diffuses out of the bead into the mesenchyme, with this FGF depletion leading to a lack of mesenchymal cell proliferation, stopping limb growth
- FGF beads (there are 22 FGF genes in human genome) release their FGF, which diffuses out of bead into mesenchyme, where it stimulates cell proliferation here.
- Mesenchyme continues proliferating until FGF in beads runs out
- Knocking out FGF 4, 8 and 9 all together in cells in the limbs causes deletion of all limb bones (Scapula still is found as it is not a limb bone)
- Individual mutations of FGF4,8 and 9 leads to no effect for FGF4 and FGF9 and minimal truncation for FGF8
- FGF8 is expressed in the primitive streak during gastrulation so an embryo-wide gene knockout of FGF8 would lead to embryo death during gastrulation, before limbs have even formed

# Induction of the Limb Bud by FGF

- FGF will also stimulate the formation of an additional limb, provided the FGF bead is implanted in the Lateral Plate Mesoderm between the forelimb and hindlimb
- The extra leg may have the morphological features of the forelimb or hindlimb or a combination of both (Chimera), depending on the proximity of the additional limb/FGF bead to the forelimb or hindlimb
- This shows that FGF is sufficient to induce limb development

# Proximal-Distal Patterning

- Secretion of FGF by the AER maintains a high rate of cell division in the underlying mesenchyme (known as the progress zone), driving the outgrowth of the limb bud
- Further away from the AER in more proximal regions of the limb bud, the decreasing [FGF] causes cells to divide more slowly, allowing structures here to differentiate
- Whilst there are multiple modules to explain proximal-distal patterning, most evidence supports a 2 signal model
- The fate of proximal elements (E.g Humerus) are specified by Retinoic Acid (RA - Vitamin A derivative) secreted by the Lateral Plate Mesenchyme in the flank/trunk whilst the fate of more distal elements are specified by FGF from the AER.
- FGF may act as a morphogen as well as a mitogen, specifying the radius/ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges (more distal skeletal elements) at increasing [ ]
- The Humerus is specified by RA whilst more distal skeletal elements are specified by FGF

# Anterior-Posterior Patterning

- Zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) = Area of mesenchyme that contains signals instructing limb bud to form along anteriorposterior axis, acting as an organising centre for the limb.
- This is found along the posterior aspect of the limb bud (near where it connects to the trunk) and expresses SHH
- John Saunders and Mary Gasseling (1968) - Grafting a portion of the posterior margin of chick wing bud (containing part of the ZPA) into anterior margin of host wing bud caused the formation of a duplicate set of digits, with symmetry down the middle of the hand/foot.
- This same effect can be seen by grafting cells secreting SHH from the Posterior to the Anterior Portion of the Limb Bud

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 15.05.22.png](%5B014%5D%20Limb%20Development%209ae733ccf9db40fa8e471b6d46ac9e58/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_15.05.22.png)

### An AP Morphogen Gradient

- ZPA was believed to be source of a morphogen, which diffuses anteriorly across the limb to specify the different digits at different concentrations
- The highest concentration specifies most posterior digit (thumb) and lowest concentration specifying most anterior digit (little finger).
- ZPA/SHH grafts expands/widens the limb bud and form a counter gradient (High [ ] on Ant and Post Aspect of Limb Bud and lowest in the centre of the limb) due to the presence of SHH secreting cells on the anterior and posterior aspect of the Limb bud.
- This causes a symmetrical distribution of SHH, causing the specification of duplicated digits, symmetrically duplicated along this counter-gradient [SHH]

# SHH Induced Digit Duplication

- Activating SHH expression in the Anterior Limb Bud causes a mirror-image duplication of the Digits, identical to that of a ZPA Graft

# SHH is Required for Limb Development

- SHH is required for proximal-distal and anterior-posterior patterning
- SHH mutations (lack of SHH) cause distally truncated limbs with few digits (Humerus still forms, usually with a single more distal element)
- The effects of SHH absence are more severe in the lower limb than in the upper limb
- Therefore, a lack of SHH disrupts the proximal-distal patterning of the limbs
- SHH is required for gastrulation so if SHH is mutated in all cells of the fetus, the embryo will die before the limb is formed
- GLI3 mutations/removal enhance SHH activity and cause polydactyly (Grieg syndrome). This mutation equivalent to ↑ SHH expression
- Therefore, overexpression of SHH disrupts the anterior-posterior patterning of the limbs

# Size Regulation in the Vertebrate Limb

1. FGF secreted from the AER induces SHH expression in the ZPA
2. SHH Expression in the ZPA induces Gremlin expression in the Distal Mesenchyme of the Limb Bud
3. Gremlin expression here inhibits BMP Signalling in the Distal Mesenchyme
4. As BMP usually inhibits FGF, This lack of BMP signalling in the Distal Mesenchyme means that there is increased FGF expression in the AER.
- Therefore, Gremlin maintains FGF Expression, which maintains SHH expression, which in turn maintains Gremlin expression in a positive feedback loop
- As the limb grows, the SHH Domain of the ZPA remains the same size, closely associated to the Posterior Margin of the Limb Bud whilst the cells that previously expressed SHH cannot express Gremlin
- This causes the formation of a barrier/layer of unresponsive cells (which increases in size with limb bud growth) separates the SHH Domain posteriorly from the Gremlin domain anteriorly.
- These cells used to/are derived from cells that previously expressed SHH and as a result, cannot be stimulated by SHH to produce Gremlin
- As this layer increases in size/thickness, it becomes more difficult for SHH to diffuse into the Distal Mesenchyme to induce Gremlin expression here, causing [SHH] in the Distal Mesenchyme to decrease
- This lower [SHH] in the SHH-Sensitive Mesenchyme leads to a reduction in Gremlin expression in the Distal Mesenchyme.
- This increases BMP Signalling (As there is reduced BMP Inhibition by Gremlin), which decreases FGF expression in the AER
- This reduced FGF Expression leads to a regression of SHH in the ZPA in a positive feedback loop, eventually cell proliferation and limb bud growth to slow down and eventually cease

# SHH Mutations in Humans

- 2 abnormalities linked to SHH mutations:
1. Pre-axial polydactyly: (1 in 2,000 births) 
- Extra digit on thumb (additional anterior digit)
- Mutation to enhancer of SHH in the limb, which expands the SHH domain in ZPA, leading to increased SHH expression in the limb.
1. Acheiropodia: (rare).
- Region in Brazil and Papa New Guinea where it is relatively frequent.
- Truncation of limbs due to absence of distal limb structures which are specified by SHH (All except Humerus).
- It is caused by a mutation that reduces SHH expression in limb bud (but not in the rest of the body or else the foetus wouldn't have survived).

# Endochondral Ossification

- Mesenchyme condenses, produce chondrocytes which produce cartilage(type II collagen + proteoglycans).
- This is followed by the Invasion of centre of bone by blood vessels
- Osteoblasts migrate in and use the cartilage as matrix for osteoid synthesis (predominantly type I collagen)
- Secondary ossification centres form around birth, responsible for elongation of bone during infancy
- Clavicle forms through intramembranous ossification
