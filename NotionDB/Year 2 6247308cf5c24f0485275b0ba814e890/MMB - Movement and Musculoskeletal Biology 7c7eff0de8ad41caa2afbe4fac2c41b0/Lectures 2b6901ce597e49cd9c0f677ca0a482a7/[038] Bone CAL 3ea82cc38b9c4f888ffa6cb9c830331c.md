# Jaw Bone and Teeth

- Gingiva = Gum (Stratified Squamous Epithelium)
- Epithelium of Gum is highly interdigitated with the Underlying Highly Vascular Connective Tissue to securely anchor the Gum to the mouth
- OCs resorb the deep aspect of the Tooth Root to allow for Milk Teeth to fall out, making room in the gums for Adult Teeth

- Osteoblasts are surrounded by a dark-purple staining Cytoplasm whereas Osteocyte Cytoplasm is difficult to see (Looks like nuclei embedded in bone matrix)
- Sometimes within bone, a thin, darkly stained line can be seen (Resting Line) from where bone growth stops temporarily and resumed shortly after

- The Periodontal Ligament is found surrounding the Ameloblasts on the superficial surface of the Tooth
- Ameloblasts are found superficial to the enamel layer of the tooth
- Enamel contains very little organic matrix and is almost all mineral (Large Crystals/Pryzms of Hydroxyapatite)
- The integrity of enamel is maintained by Ca²⁺ and PO₄³⁻ within the Saliva which deposit/mineralise within the Enamel to maintain its hardness
- Odontoblasts are found deep to the Layer of Dentine (Connective Tissue of Teeth) in the Tooth and synthesise dentine (Mainly Mineralised Type I Collagen

- Immature/Woven bone is highly granular/cellular due to the high cellular activity here
- Osteoclasts resorb bone moving superficially, found just superficial to the Periodontal Ligament (found along its superficial surface) to allow for the erupting tooth to migrate superficially
- Inferior to the tooth, the cavity formed by the erupting tooth is filled up by new bone secreted by Osteoblasts whilst Osteoblasts are found on the Superior surface of Alveolar Bone
- The net effect of OBs and OCs on Alveolar bone makes it seem as though it is migrating superficially, along the same path as the Erupting Tooth
- Deep to the Osteoblasts, a thin pale staining layer of Osteoid is seen which rapidly darkens as you move deep as the Osteoid becomes mineralised to form Bone Matrix
- These processes occur due to upward pressure from the erupting tooth on the surrounding Alveolar Bone, as detected by Osteocytes

- Alveolar Bone of the Jaw is an example of Woven Bone, with irregularly organised/distribute Collagen and Osteocytes
- Alveolar Bone contains a high [Osteoclasts] due to its nature as temporary bone, allowing it to be resorbed to allow for the Developing Tooth to migrate superficially and erupt out of the gums

# Adult Phalange

- No Epiphyseal growth plates are present in adult bones
- Has 2 layers of Articular Cartilage at either end, a concave layer proximally and a convex layer distally
- Cortical Bone is found superficially within the bone and stains a light pink, appearing relatively amorphous at low power
- Cortical Bone is highly vascular, containing many longitudinal blood vessels running down the length of the bone (makes the bone appear like it contains many, long artefacts) and a few lateral channels (appear more circular and less elongated than longitudinal vessels)
- Tendons are commonly found associated to bone, comprised of Coarse Collagen bundles (Stain very dark red and appear very wavy, with artefacts found between the coarse collagen bundles)

![Finger01.jpeg](%5B038%5D%20Bone%20CAL%203ea82cc38b9c4f888ffa6cb9c830331c/Finger01.jpeg)

- Most bone found deep to the Periosteal Surface AKA Bone surrounding the Endosteal Surfaces is Quiescent, containing no/very few Osteoclasts and Osteoblasts due to its low turnover rate, hence making the Bone appear highly amorphous
- The Endosteal Surface of the Bone is covered by a flattened layer of inactive Osteoblasts (Bone Lining Cells) which protect the Underlying Bone

![Finger02.jpeg](%5B038%5D%20Bone%20CAL%203ea82cc38b9c4f888ffa6cb9c830331c/Finger02.jpeg)

- Tendons are much more granular and darker staining than Cortical Bone
- Osteoclasts are found embedded into the Periosteal Surface of the Bone, notably during Bone Remodelling
- Osteoclasts stain a light pink, much lighter than the red-orangey bone
- Around the Periosteal Surface, Bone is highly granular due to the Presence of Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts involved in Bone Remodelling and Turnover

![Finger03.jpeg](%5B038%5D%20Bone%20CAL%203ea82cc38b9c4f888ffa6cb9c830331c/Finger03.jpeg)

- There are much fewer Osteoclasts found in Lamellar Bone compared to Woven Bone due to the lower Cellular Activity of Lamellar Bone
- There are very few Osteoclasts found in bone as Lamellar Bone has a lower turnover rate than Woven Bone (doesn't need to be replaced as much) and also due to the damage-potential of Osteoclasts due to their resorptive function
- Plywood organisation of Collagen within Lamellar Fibres increases the Strength of the Bone and reduces the chance of Small Microcracks stretching down the bone to form Large Fractures
- Periosteum = Highly Collaginous fibrous layer that is unmineralised that is found surrounding the Bone surface
- It is highly vascular, with many blood vessels piercing and running through it

- The Soft Unmineralised Cartilage layer contains more Chondrocytes than the underlying Mineralised Cartilage Layer
- The Tidemark Zone is a very thin jagged line that stains dark purple
- Subchondral Bone stains a darker red than Articular Cartilage (stains pink) and appears more cellular/granular
- Subchondral Bone is Lamellar Bone, easily identified by the regular organisation of the Layers of Bone
- In Adult Bone, Marrow contains lots of Adipocytes and little Haematopoetic Tissue
- Due to the high protection given by the surrounding Bone, Bone Vasculature has a very thin wall (Sinusoids) and can be found in the Marrow
- These can be differentiated from Adipocytes as they are much larger than Adipocytes, have slightly thicker membranes/walls and often are irregularly shaped. Sometimes, sinusoids also have blood within them whilst Adipocytes do not
- Adipocytes are present in high [ ] in bone as it is lightweight whilst also reinforcing and filling the internal marrow cavities whilst also acting as an emergency fuel store
- Chondrocytes are much larger than Osteocytes (Osteocytes cannot be seen, only the Lacunae in which they are found)
- Haematopoetic tissue is extremely cellular and stain a very dark purple
- As an individual ages, the amount of yellow, fatty bone marrow increases

![Finger07.jpeg](%5B038%5D%20Bone%20CAL%203ea82cc38b9c4f888ffa6cb9c830331c/Finger07.jpeg)

- Periosteal surface of bone appears highly granular due to the layer of flattened Osteoblasts forming Bone Lining Cells

![Finger08.jpeg](%5B038%5D%20Bone%20CAL%203ea82cc38b9c4f888ffa6cb9c830331c/Finger08.jpeg)

- Bone contains lots of Fossae/Pores through which blood vessels run through to supply the bone
- Cortical Bone appears continuous, with no isolated bone segments.
- Trabecular Bone can be found as lots of discontinuous segments of Lamellar Bone found deep within the Marrow Cavity
- Trabecular Bone often appears discontinuous as the trabecular elements that connect different segments of Trabecular Bone are often cut in TS vs LS or not caught in the plane of the section, making the bone segments that they connect appear separate

# Cortical Bone

- Cortical Bone appears histologically as a series of Overlapping Concentric Rings (Osteons/Haversian Systems)
- Central Transverse Canal = Haversian Canal

![Cortbone01.jpeg](%5B038%5D%20Bone%20CAL%203ea82cc38b9c4f888ffa6cb9c830331c/Cortbone01.jpeg)

- During Cortical Remodelling, the size of the Longitudinal Tunnel through the bone that is excavated by Osteoclasts is the size of the entire Haversian System
- Osteoblasts lining the Endosteal Surface of the Cavity dug out by Osteoblasts then slowly refill the cavity with Concentric Rings of Lamellar Bone
- Secondary Osteons are newer Osteons that are built on/overlap with an Older, Primary Osteon
- Secondary Osteons stain much darker than Primary Osteons, with more Lacunae and Canaliculi
- Formation of Secondary Osteons to replace Primary Osteons = Haversian Remodelling
- Lamellae = Concentric Layers of Bone found within the Haversian Systems of Cortical Bone
- The Collagen Fibres in adjacent lamellae are orientated 90° from each other, as is typical for Lamellar Bone

![Cortbone02.jpeg](%5B038%5D%20Bone%20CAL%203ea82cc38b9c4f888ffa6cb9c830331c/Cortbone02.jpeg)

- Osteocytes are regularly spaced along the Lamellae of Haversian Systems within Cortical Bone
- Canaliculi which extend to and from the Central Transverse Canal in a Haversian System (and between Lacunae) allows for contact between the Central Blood Vessel Channel and other parts of the Osteon, allowing Extravasation of Promonocyte Precursors to stimulate bone growth in response to mechanical stress

# Normal and Osteoporotic Bone

- In normal bone, Trabecular Bone is characterised by thick, regular interconnecting plates/elements
- This allows for a strong, rigid structure of Trabecular bone that can withstand the stresses and strains encountered in normal life whilst being relatively lightweight

![BoneSEM01.jpeg](%5B038%5D%20Bone%20CAL%203ea82cc38b9c4f888ffa6cb9c830331c/BoneSEM01.jpeg)

- Osteoporosis is characterised by thinning and complete erosion of Trabecular Elements which can fracture with minimal trauma
- Overlapping resorption pits can also be seen across the surface of the thinned trabecular elements ('Moth-Eaten' Appearance)
- Spinal Osteoporosis leads to Compression Fractures, Height Loss and Dowager's Hump
- Hyperactive OCs seen in Elderly Px with Osteoporosis could reflect the huge stem cell capacity of the Haematopoetic System, where new OCs and other Haematopoetic Cells can be formed, even at old age
- In Elderly Individuals, there are fewer osteoblasts and activity of these OBs decreases, indicating a reduced capacity for Bone Formation in the elderly (Except During Would Healing)
