# [008] The Axilla and Brachial Plexus

# Axilla and its Boundaries

### The Axilla

- This is the gateway to the upper limb, permitting the passage of nerves and vessels from the body into the arm. All structures passing into or from the Upper Limb must pass through the Axilla
- The axilla is an area of transition. There are a few of these in the upper limb:
- The axilla is the gateway between the trunk and the neck and upper limb (specifically the neck)
- The cubital fossa is the gateway between the arm and the forearm, it lies in front of the elbow
- The carpal tunnel is the gateway between the forearm and hand
- All of the nerves and the vessels pass over the first rib and then dive down into the axilla, with many of them changing names as they cross over the first rib.

- The axilla is roughly pyramidal in shape:
• It has four walls
• A floor
• One inlet, which is at the apex of the pyramid and it points superiorly and medially towards the neck.

### Axillary Inlet

- This is at the top of the axilla and it is roughly triangular in shape when viewing it superiorly.
- All of its boundaries are formed/defined by bones:
o The anterior margin is defined by the clavicle
o The medial margin is formed by the superior margin of Rib 1
o The posterior margin is formed by the superior margin of the scapula lateral to the coracoid process
- The axillary inlet is continuous with the neck, and this is where all the nerves and vessels descend to get into the axilla after passing over the first rib.

### Anterior Wall of the Axilla

- The anterior wall is formed most superficially by the pectoralis major muscle
- Deep to that, it is also formed by the pectoralis minor and subclavius muscles
- The clavipectoral fascia also forms part of the anterior wall of the axilla.
- The Clavipectoral Fascia is a thick layer of fascia/connective tissue which lies between pectoralis major and encloses pectoralis minor and the subclavius muscles. It stretches from the clavicle to the floor of the axilla
- Lower margain of the Pectoralis major forms an important feature of the surface anatomy of the axilla called the anterior axillary fold
o This is the anterior edge/wall of the armpit

### Medial Wall of the Axilla

- The medial wall is formed from the superior region of the thoracic wall:
1) The ribcage and intercostal muscles
2) Serratus anterior
- There are two notable nerves along the anterior surface of the thoracic wall:
1) The Long Thoracic Nerve comes off the brachial plexus and innervates serratus anterior
2) The intercostobrachial nerve is not associated with the brachial plexus and is a lateral branch of the second intercostal nerve. It provides sensory innervation to the skin of the medial and posterior parts of the upper arm
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.13.07.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.13.07.png)
    

### Floor/Base of the Axilla

- The floor/base of the axilla is simply a dome of fascia and skin of the armpit, with a variable appearance depending on how loose/tight the skin of the armpit is.
- There are no muscles here
- Any structures that need to pass into the upper limb, must pass lateral to the floor of the axilla
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.13.25.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.13.25.png)
    

### Lateral Wall of the Axilla

- The lateral wall is very narrow
- It is formed by the intertubercular sulcus/bicipital groove of the humerus
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.14.00.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.14.00.png)
    

### Posterior Wall of the Axilla

- Its bony framework is provided by the anterior surface of the scapula
- Several muscles also contribute to it:
1) Subscapularis
2) Distal part of Teres Major and Latissimus Dorsi
- Together, these define the lower boundary of the axilla
- The Teres Major and Latissimus Dorsi together form the Posterior Axillary Fold (The posterior edge/wall of the Armpit) and is usually found more inferiorly than the Anterior Axillary Fold
- Like the first rib, many structures change name as they pass the boundary of the first rib and latissimus dorsi
3) The proximal part of the long head of the triceps

# Gateways in the Posterior Wall of the Axilla

- The skeleton, along with the muscles form a number of different apertures/gateways in the posterior wall of the Axilla. Various structures pass through these. There are four apertures that are particularly important:

### 1) Suprascapular Foramen

- The superior scapular notch is spanned by the superior transverse scapular ligament.
- The suprascapular nerve passes under the ligament, through the
suprascapular foramen (notch + ligament)
- The suprascapular artery and vein passes above the ligament
- The nerve innervates the supraspinatus muscle
- Both the nerve and artery pass through the greater scapular notch and supply infraspinatus

### 2) Quadrangular Space

- This is square-shaped and found inferolaterally to the Suprascapular Foramen
- Its boundaries are formed superiorly by the inferior margin of teres minor muscle, laterally by the surgical neck of the humerus, inferiorly by the superior margin of teres major muscle and medially by the lateral margin of the long head of the triceps.
- 2 Structures pass through the Quadrangular Space:
1. The axillary nerve which innervates the deltoid and teres minor
2. The posterior humeral circumflex artery
- Both of these go through the quadrangular space and run tightly around the back of the surgical neck of the humerus
- These means both of the structures are at risk if the surgical neck of the humerus is fractured

### 3) Triangular Space

- This is medial to the quadrangular space and separated from it by the Long Head of Triceps Brachii
- Its superior boundary is formed by inferior margin of teres minor, its lower boundary is
formed by the superior margin of teres major and its lateral boundary is formed by the
medial margin of long head of the triceps
- The circumflex scapular artery passes through this gap

### 4) Triangular Interval

- This is found inferior to the Triangular and Quadrangular Spaces
- Its boundaries are formed by the inferior margin of teres major superiorly, the long head of
triceps medially and the shaft of the humerus laterally
- The radial nerve and the deep artery of the arm (profunda brachii artery) pass through this
- These run in the radial groove, closely associated to the Humerus, which spirals round the back of the humerus
- Sometimes, muscles that form the boundaries of these gateways may become inflamed and undergo hypertrophy. Here, they can compress the nerves and vessels that pass through the spaces and hence, impact their functioning (Reduced innervation and blood flow to structures distal to the Space/Gateway)

# Axillary Content - Muscles

[Muscles within the Axilla Itself](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Muscles%20within%20the%20Axilla%20Itself%20d7302d77d62f4b5baa187347a284b4a6.md)

# Axillary Content - Arteries

- The relationship of the arteries with the surrounding structures is very important
- The main artery within the axilla is called the axillary artery. However, it is a continuation of the subclavian artery
- As the subclavian artery passes over the first rib, its name changes to the axillary artery, where it supplies the Axilla
- As it passes out of the axilla, past the lower boundary of latissimus dorsi and teres major (Inferior Boundary), its name changes again to the Brachial artery
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.41.44.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.41.44.png)
    
- The axillary artery is divided into three parts within
the axilla, defined by Pectoralis Minor:
1. The first part is between the first rib and
pectoralis minor (Superior/Proximal to Pec Minor, in the Axilla)
2. The second part is deep to pectoralis minor
3. The third part is between pectoralis minor and the lower boundary of teres major (Inferior/Distal to Pec Minor, in the Axilla)
- There are six major branches that come off the
axillary artery, with there being one branch coming off the first part, two branches coming off the second part and three branches coming off the third part.
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.44.25.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.44.25.png)
    

### Branches of the First Part of the Axillary Artery

- The first branch that comes off the first part is a very small and deep artery
called the superior thoracic artery
- It runs inferomedially to supply the upper medial and anterior axillary walls
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.46.08.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.46.08.png)
    

### Branches of the Second Part of the Axillary Artery

- Just before the upper edge of pectoralis minor (Just medial to Pectoralis Minor) comes the thoracoacromial artery/trunk
- This is a big but short artery that immediately divides into four branches:
1) Clavicular
2) Acromial
3) Deltoid
4) Pectoral
(**Cadavers Are Dead People**)
- It supplies blood to the anterior wall of the axilla and chest
- Coming off the lower edge of pectoralis minor (Just lateral to Pectoralis Minor), the lateral thoracic artery courses down the lateral/inferior edge of pectoralis minor and supplies various structures on the lateral side of the thorax, Pectoralis Minor and Serratus Anterior + anterior and medial Axillary walls
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.49.24.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_11.49.24.png)
    

### Branches of the Third Part of the Axillary Artery

- There are three branches coming off this:

### 1) The Subscapular Artery

- This is the largest branch of the Axillary artery that divides into two terminal branches immediately:
- It is the main artery supplying the Posterior Axillary wall
1. Circumflex Scapular Artery (Larger Branch) - Passes through the triangular space on the back and through to the infraspinous fossa where it anastomoses with branches of the Suprascapular and Dorsal Scapular Arteries.
2. Thoracodorsal Artery (Smaller Branch) Latissimus dorsi is
innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve

### 2) The Anterior Humeral Circumflex Artery:

- This is smaller than the Posterior Humeral Circumflex Artery
- It goes around the front of the surgical neck of the humerus

### 3) Posterior Humeral Circumflex Artery:

- This is larger than the Anterior Humeral Circumflex Artery
- It goes through the quadrangular space along with the axillary nerve and goes around the back of the surgical neck of the humerus
- The Anterior and Posterior Circumflex Arteries usually come off as two
separate arteries but this is not always the case
- The two circumflex arteries anastamose to form a loop around the surgical neck of the humerus. This is dangerous when a fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus occurs

# Arterial Supply to the Shoulder (A bit difficult to understand)

Subclavian-Axillary Anastamoses:

1. Subclavian → Thyrocervical Trunk → Transverse Cervical → Deep Branch of the Transverse Cervical/Dorsal Scapular (Descends down medial border of Scapula, deep to Rhomboids - Sometimes arises from Suprascapular Artery) ↔  Circumflex Scapular ← Subscapular ← Axillary. Anastamosis occurs within Infraspinous Fossa on the Posterior Surface of the Scapula
2. Subclavian → Thyrocervical Trunk → Suprascapular ↔  Circumflex Scapular Artery ← Subscapular ← Axillary Artery

Axillary-Axillary Anastamoses:

1. The Anterior and Posterior Circumflex Humeral Arteries send branches that ascend and descend along the lateral border of the Humerus to anastamose with branches from the Suprascapular Artery (from Subclavian) and Profunda Brachii Artery/Deep Artery of the Arm (Axillary) respectively
2. The Anterior and Posterior Circumflex Humeral Arteries travel around and anastamose around the surgical neck of the Humerus.
3. Acromial Branch of Thoracoacromial Artery/Trunk (From Axillary) anastomoses with Suprascapular Artery (Subclavian), Deltoid Branch of Thoracoacromial Artery (Axillary) and Posterior Circumflex Humeral Artery (Axillary). This anastamosis is found on the superior surface of the Acromion Process  
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/IMG_2982.jpg](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/IMG_2982.jpg)
    
- Anastamosis around the body of the Scapula (In Infraspinous Fossa) involves:
1. Deep Branch of Transverse Cervical Artery/Dorsal Scapular Artery (Subclavian)
2. Suprascapular Artery (Subclavian)
3. Circumflex Scapular Artery (Axillary)
- Anastamosis around the Acromion Process (on superior surface of Acromion) involves:
1. Acromial Branch of Thoracoacromial Artery (Axillary)
2. Acromial Branch of Suprascapular Artery (Subclavian)
3. Acromial Branch of Posterior Circumflex Humeral Artery (Axillary)

# Axillary Content - Veins

- The basilic vein is a large vein that comes out of the medial side of the forearm
- As soon as it crosses the lower boundary of teres major, moving proximally, it changes its name to the axillary vein - This is like the artery
- It accompanies the axillary artery through the axilla and it is anteromedial to it
- As it crosses the first rib, it changes its name to the subclavian vein
- The cephalic vein drains the upper limb superficially and runs superomedially between deltoid and pectoralis major in the deltopectoral groove. It then dives down and drains into the axillary vein (it is a major tributary of the Axillary Vein) proximal to Pec Minor, around the level of Rib 2
- There is a nice relationship between structures at the
first rib:
1) The axillary vein is most anterior
2) The anterior scalene muscle inserts onto the first rib
3) The axillary artery is posterior to this

---

# Axillary Content - Lymphatics and Mammary Gland

### Lymphatics

- The axilla also contains lymphatics
- There are about 20 – 30 lymph nodes in the axilla that drain the entire upper limb (All Lymph from the Upper Limb must drain into nodes within the Axilla)
- They also drain the base of the neck, upper part of the back and the lateral part of the thorax and chest
- Importantly, they are responsible for 75% of the drainage of the breast which is an important consideration in breast cancer
- The nodes are arranged in 5 different groups:
1. Lateral (humeral)
2. Pectoral (alongside pectoralis minor)
3. Subscapular
4. Central
5. Apical

### The Mammary Gland (Potential Content of the Axilla)

- The majority of the mammary gland is located on the front of the chest
- The axillary content is variable in length, but in some cases, the axillary process/tail can loop underneath the inferior margin of pectoralis major muscle to ascend inside the axilla
- This is an important consideration in the event of breast cancer

# Axillary Content - Nerves

- The brachial plexus is a particularly important content of the axilla
- A plexus is a way to combine/connect innervation from different spinal levels into one peripheral nerve
- It is a kind of interchange for the different spinal levels
- The brachial plexus is formed by the ventral rami of spinal levels C5 to T1
- It is a somatic plexus that supplies all of the motor and sensory innervation to the upper limb apart from trapezius (innervated by cranial nerve XI) and the regiment’s badge (intercostobrachial nerve)
- It carries sympathetic fibres to the upper limb blood vessels, erector pili and sweat glands from T2 – T6
- There is no parasympathetic innervation in the upper limb

# Brachial Plexus

- The brachial plexus is divided into five parts:
1. The roots are formed from the ventral rami of C5 - T1 (There are 5 roots)
2. These combine to form three trunks (Upper, Middle and Lower)
3. These then split up to form six divisions (Posterior and Anterior Divisions of each Trunk)
4. They then recombine to form three cords (Lateral, Posterior and Medial)
5. This results in four large terminal nerves that surround the axillary artery. These then go down into the upper limb
    
    ![Brachial Plexus Simplified](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_17.45.59.png)
    
    Brachial Plexus Simplified
    
    - The divisions are roots, trunks, divisions, cords and terminal nerves
    - The roots (and trunks) enter the neck, where they lie between the anterior and middle scalene muscles and behind the subclavian artery before subsequently surrounding the axillary artery more distally in the plexus as 3 cords.
    - Order of structures at the neck = Vein, Artery, Brachial Plexus (VAP)
    - The trunks pass over the first rib
    - The divisions, cords and terminal nerves are inside the axilla itself
    - As the trunks are found at the first rib, they are associated with the subclavian artery.
    - The divisions, cords and terminal nerves are associated with the first, second and third parts of the axillary artery respectively.
    - The names of the cords indicate their position relative to the axillary artery and are all found deep to Pec Minor:
    • The posterior cord is behind the artery
    • The lateral cord is lateral to the artery
    • The medial cord is medial to the artery
    - The brachial plexus has a very distinctive M shape which is formed by three of the terminal nerves - Quick way to identify the distal end of the plexus

# Branches of the Roots and Trunks

The branches of the roots and trunks are only motor innervation they do not carry any sensory fibres

### Branches of the Roots of the Brachial Plexus

- These have 3 branches:
1. The dorsal scapular nerve (C5) innervates the rhomboid muscles and part of the innervation of levator scapulae (along with C3 and C4)
2. Small contributions to the Phrenic Nerve from C5
3. The long thoracic nerve (C5, C6 and C7) supplies serratus anterior. It is very superficial and Patients with a damaged long thoracic nerve will present with a winged scapula

### Branches of the Trunks of the Brachial Plexus

- There are superior, middle and inferior trunks:
1. The superior trunk is a combination of C5 and C6
2. The middle trunk is the continuation of C7
3. The inferior trunk is a combination of C8 and T1
- There are two branches coming off the superior trunk (no branches off the other trunks):
1. The suprascapular nerve innervates supraspinatus and infraspinatus after travelling through the suprascapular foramen (under the ligament)
2. The nerve to subclavius
- Each trunk divides in two to form anterior and posterior divisions
- This leads to six divisions:
1. The anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunk combine to form the lateral cord (lateral to the axillary artery)
2. The anterior division of the medial trunk continues on its own to form the medial cord
3. All three posterior divisions combine to form the posterior cord
- There are no branches coming off the divisions

# Branches of the Lateral and Medial Cords

### Branches of the Lateral Cord (C5-C7)

- There is one branch coming off the lateral cord
- This is called the lateral pectoral nerve which goes on to innervate pectoralis major

### Branches of the Medial Cord (C8-T1)

- There are three branches coming off the medial cord:
1. The medial pectoral nerve is motor and innervates pectoralis major and minor
2. The medial brachial cutaneous nerve/medial cutaneous nerve of the arm provides sensory innervation to the medial cutaneous lower/distal part of the arm (There is also some contribution from T2). More proximal region of the Medial arm is supplied by the Intercostobrachial Nerve from T2
3. The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve/medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm provides sensory innervation to the medial cutaneous part of the forearm

# Branches of the Posterior Cord

There are 4 branches of the Posterior Cord:

1. The axillary nerve (C5 and C6)- This is the largest branch of the Posterior Cord. This innervates deltoid, teres minor (motor) and the 'regimental badge' area of skin on the Lateral arm/brachium (sensory). The Axillary Nerve is sometimes considered to be one of the terminal branches of the Brachial Plexus, instead of being a branch of the Posterior Cord
2. The superior subscapular nerve (C5 and C6) - This innervates subscapularis
3. The inferior subscapular nerve (C5 and C6) - This innervates subscapularis and teres major
4. The thoracodorsal nerve (C6 – C8) goes on to innervate latissimus dorsi

# Terminal Branches of the Brachial Plexus

- The lateral cord divides into two:
1. The musculocutaneous nerve (C5 – C7) provides motor innervation to all the muscles of
the anterior compartment of the arm. It also provides some sensory innervation to the lateral forearm.
2. The other part of the lateral cord combines with the medial cord to form the median nerve (C5, C6 – T1). This provides motor innervation to most of the muscles in the anterior compartment of the forearm, the thenar muscles and two of the lumbricals in the hand (intrinsic muscles). It also provides some sensory innervation to the hand, over the lateral palmar surface.

The medial cord divides into:

1. One part of the Medial Cord combines with a segment of the Lateral Cord to form the Median Nerve
2. The ulnar nerve (C7, C8 – T1) - This innervates two muscles of the anterior compartment of the forearm (flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profunda). It is very important for innervating most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. It also provides some sensory innervation to the hand, over the medial palmar surface.
- The posterior cord becomes/continues as the radial nerve:
- This is the largest terminal nerve
- It innervates all of the muscles of the posterior compartment of the arm, forearm and provides sensory innervation to the majority of the upper limb (predominantly posterior arm and forearm), including the back of the hand (dorsolateral region of the hand)

# Upper Limb Dermatomes (NOT COVERED IN THE LECTURE VIDEO)

- The more caudal dermatomes (inferior) actually extend further out distally to the limb
- As the limb develops and changes shape the distribution of the dermatomes changes but it maintains the same overall pattern
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_20.05.07.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_20.05.07.png)
    
- The dermatomes can be followed around the room
- The lower the root value (AKA Cx or Tx), the higher up/more proximal on the upper limb the dermatome will be
- Dermatomes can be traced down the lateral aspect of the limb and back up the medial aspect
- Testing dermatomes of the upper limb:
- There is considerable overlap between dermatomes but there are places with minimal overlap where the dermatomes can be tested:
o C5 = Upper Lateral Arm
o C6 = Pad of the Thumb
o C7 = Pad of the Index Finger
o C8 = Pad of the Little Finger
o T1 = Medial Elbow
- Ventral axial line separates C3-C6 from C8 – T2

# Cutaneous Nerves of the Upper Limb

- As well as the dermatomes, there is sensation that is provided by different individual nerves
- The intercostobrachial nerve supplies the medial upper part of the arm, in the armpit. This nerve does not come off the brachial plexus but the second intercostal nerve
- The medial cutaneous nerve of the arm comes off the medial cord as well as the medial cutaneous nerve of the forearm
- The back of the arm has the radial nerve providing innervation
- Superior Lateral Cutaneous Nerve of Arm (Branch of Axillary Nerve) innervates regimental badge area
- Medial Cutaneous Nerve of Arm innervates inferomedial portion of arm (superomedial portion of arm, near the armpit is provided by the Intercostobrachial Nerve)
- Posterior Cutaneous Nerve of Arm and Inferior Lateral Cutaneous Nerve of Arm (both branches of Radial Nerve) innervate the posterior region of the arm
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_20.09.37.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_20.09.37.png)
    
- Posterior region of Forearm is innervated by Posterior Cutaneous Nerve of Forearm (Branch of Radial Nerve)
- Lateral Cutaneous Nerve of Forearm (Branch of Musculocutaneous Nerve) innervates the lateral side of the forearm
- Medial Cutaneous Nerve of the Forearm (Branch of the Medial Cord) innervates the medial aspect of the forearm

- The ulnar nerve provides sensory innervation to the inside of the hand and medial one and a half digits
- The median nerve provides sensory innervation to the lateral part of the hand and the lateral three and a half digits
- A superficial branch of the radial nerve provides innervation to the dorsum of the hand (medial side)

# Brachial Plexus Injuries

![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_20.11.46.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_20.11.46.png)

- There are issues that occur with injuries to the various parts of the brachial plexus
- A winged scapula happens due to a damaged long thoracic nerve due to loss of function of the Serratus Anterior (Scapula no longer pulled against the Posterior Ribcage, allowing it to wing away)
- If the axillary nerve is injured, deltoid becomes paralysed, resulting in the arm being unable to abduct and wasting away of the muscle

### Erb's Palsy (Erb-Duchenne Palsy)

- The roots of the brachial plexus can be damaged
- If the upper roots (C5 and C6) are damaged this results in Erb’s Palsy
- This can happen during dramatic lateral bending of the neck, resulting in the roots being pulled out or during childbirth
- **If this occurs:**
o It takes out supraspinatus and infraspinatus (become paralysed) due to the suprascapular nerve being damaged
o It will take out the dorsal scapular nerve (it becomes damaged/non-functional) going to rhomboid and levator scapulae
o It will take out the axillary nerve
o It takes out the musculocutaneous nerve, which goes to the anterior compartment of the arm
o It takes out part of the radial nerve, as it is also supplied by other spinal nerves
- Implications of nerve damage:
o The loss of supraspinatus (abduction <15°) and deltoid (abduction >15°) due to a damaged suprascapular and axillary nerve prevents abduction of the arm, so the arm simply hangs at the side
o The loss of infraspinatus and teres minor, due to a damaged suprascapular and axillary nerve. prevents lateral rotation from occurring, meaning the action of medial rotators of the arm like latissimus dorsi, subscapularis and pectoralis minor, results in the arm becoming permanently medially rotated
o The loss of the musculocutaneous nerve means biceps brachii and brachialis can no longer flex the arm or supinate the arm.
o The radial nerve partial loss prevents extension of the fingers
- This means the whole upper arm becomes medially rotated, with flexed fingers
• This results in a “Waiter’s Tip” posture

### Klumpke's Palsy

- This occurs due to damage to the lower roots (C8 and T1) of the brachial plexus
- It is caused by hyperabduction of the arm (e.g. grabbing to stop falling)
- This damages the ulnar nerve, which supplies the intrinsic muscles of the hand
- This results in a “Claw Hand’ - 4th and 5th digits (lateral 2 digits) cannot be extended
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_20.23.17.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_20.23.17.png)
    

### Radial Nerve Injury

- The radial nerve can be damaged high up due to fracture of the humerus, as it spirals around the back of the humerus in the radial groove
- It can be damaged due to prolonged high pressure in the armpit which compresses the axillary nerve. This can be due to
1) Improper use of crutches
2)“Saturday Night Palsy” (Drunkenly falling asleep with an arm draped over the back of a chair)
3) Fracture of the Humerus (as Radial Nerve lies within Radial Groove)
- These cause compression and permanent damage to the radial nerve
- This results in the loss of triceps, all the extensors of the wrists and fingers as well as sensation in the back of the arm (loss of action of muscles in posterior compartment of the arm and forearm)
- The typical presentation of this is “Wrist Drop”, where the patient is unable to extend their wrist and fingers
    
    ![%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_20.27.22.png](%5B008%5D%20The%20Axilla%20and%20Brachial%20Plexus%20d45dc40699374c1db25226e4ae621c9a/Screenshot_2021-07-02_at_20.27.22.png)
    

### Median Nerve Damage

- This can be damaged at different levels:
o Damage at the elbow would result in the loss of the finger and wrist flexors
o Damage at the wrist would result in a loss of some of the muscles of the hand as the ulnar nerve innervates the majority of the muscles of the hand
- Damage to the Median Nerve paralyses the finger and wrist flexors, thenar muscles and the 1st and 2nd Lumbricals of the Hand.
- If a patient is asked to make a fist, they cannot flex the joint of their second and third digits
and thus they will have a “Hand of Benediction/Pope’s Blessing or Hand”
