# [021] Muscle Function in Health and Disease

# Muscle Action for Task Performance

- Skeletal Muscle can perform a wide variety of functions and produce widely varied movements (Skilled Activity, Sporting Activities, Postural Activity and Respiration/Vocalisation)
- Movements are Controlled in relation to Information Processing:
1. Idea (Purpose/Motivation)
2. Plan/Forward Model (Movement Plan put together by CNS based on prior experiences)
3. Muscle Activation to produce desired action (Execution)
4. Sensory Feedback occurs during and after the task (Appraisal) to allow for refinement of the forward model to fine tune the movements produced

# Producing Greater Tension and the Types of Muscle Activity (Contraction)

### Producing Greater Tension

1. Recruit more motor units: send a larger drive (give a strong stimulus) to motor neurone pool
2. ↑ rate of firing of motor unit (summation)

### Types of Muscle Activity (Contraction)

1. Concentric: muscle shortens whilst generating force. This is as Force/Tension > load, allowing the load to be moved and shortening the muscle
2. Isometric: muscle develops tension to overcome resistance, but no change in muscle length.
- This is used to maintain the position of the object exerting a load on the muscle (AKA produce no movement)
- Force/Tension = load
- Example: exerting force against table
1. Eccentric: Muscle develops tension/contracts whilst it is lengthening (due to stretch from the load).
- Mechanism of Eccentric Contractions is unknown but is thought to involve Titin (Elastic Protein that attaches to the Z Band of the Sarcomere)
- This contraction type generates most force.
- Force/Tension < load (hence why muscle stretches whilst generating tension as the load stretches the muscle.

### Definitions

- Muscle strength =  maximum force or tension output generated by a single muscle or related muscle groups during isometric contraction.
- Measured in a variety of ways including 1RM (repetition maximum), hand held dynamometer (static), isokinetics (velocity).
- Muscle torque refers to angular motion (a necessary consideration as muscles act over joints which act as levers).
- Muscle power = product of force and velocity of muscle action (Work per unit time = Force X Distance per unit time)
- Therefore, Muscle Power is dependent on the Tension Generated, the Shortening of the Muscle fibre and the Contraction Velocity

# Factors Which Influence Muscle Contraction

### Neural Factors:

1. Descending drive: As Descending Drive increases, more motor neurons are activated within the spinal cord, hence activating more motor units of increasing size
2. Motor neuron (or motor unit) recruitment/coding

### Biomechanical Factors:

1. Cross sectional area: As CSA increases (muscle gets bigger), maximum tension that can be generated increases
2. Muscle fibre type
3. Visco elastic properties
4. Muscle architecture: the way fibres are arranged
5. Length-tension
6. Load velocity
7. Contraction time

### Other factors:

1. Temperature - Muscles function better when they are warmer
2. Fatigue - When muscles are fatigued, they are more susceptible to injury and generate weaker tensions
3. Pre-stretch - Pre-stretching of Muscles allows muscle to generate more force

---

# Length-Tension Relationship

- Tension is proportional to extent of overlap of actin and myosin filaments, the greater the overlap, the more cross-bridges that form
- As muscle shortens during contraction, there is greater tension as there is greater overlap between actin and myosin, meaning more cross-bridges
- If overlapping exceeds a certain point, there are fewer cross-bridges formed, which ↓ tension
- Greatest Muscle Torque (motion at a joint) is produced at the midpoint of the angle range which a joint can produce as joint angle determines the extent at which agonists and antagonists are stretched and hence, the length of the sarcomere before contraction

---

# Force-Velocity Relationship

- As you move from Eccentric to Concentric Contractions, Decreasing Velocity of Eccentric Contractions causes Muscle Force to Decrease and Increasing Velocity of Concentric Contractions causes Muscle Force to Decrease
- This occurs with a sigmoidal pattern, and where the Force Curve crosses the y axis (Shortening Velocity = 0), this is the Isometric Power generated by the Muscle
- Peak Muscle Power/Maximum Power is usually generated at 1/3rd of the Maximum Contraction Velocity for that muscle (Product of Work and Contraction Time is greatest here)

- At Velocity = 0, Power = 0 as no Work is Done (No Distance is travelled by the Muscle Fibre) and at Maximum Velocity, Force = 0 so no Work is done

# Muscle Architecture and Muscle Action

- Muscle Architecture influences the CSA of the muscle
- If fibres are organised in a Parallel manner (Tendon formed at the end of the Muscle) so that all fibres are in the same direction, the circumference of the entire muscle can be measured to measure CSA
- If fibres are organised in a Pennate manner (Muscle Fibres converge on a Central Aponeurosis/Tendon), more Muscle Fibres can be organised into the same volume in comparison to a Parallel Muscle Arrangement
- Pennate Muscles have a higher muscle fibre density than parallel muscles

![Screenshot 2021-10-07 at 10.18.28.png](%5B021%5D%20Muscle%20Function%20in%20Health%20and%20Disease%203e0f508d79844089b2734cb8bfa0c4db/Screenshot_2021-10-07_at_10.18.28.png)

- There are 2 Types of CSA:
1. Anatomical Cross-Sectional Area - The largest cross-sectional area that can be measured along the length of the entire muscle
2. Physiological Cross-Sectional Area = The largest cross-sectional area of a muscle that can be measured perpendicular to its fibres (Cross-section based on the Orientation of the Fibres)
- ACSA < PCSA
- The true CSA when focused on the Tension generation of a muscle is PCSA and can only be measured using ultrasound scans of the muscle

# Requirements of Skeletal Muscle and Types of Fibres

### Requirements of Skeletal Muscle

1. Strength and speed
2. Explosive power (e.g. sprinting, weight lifting, quick postural adjustment)
3. Fatigue resistance (Endurance to complete task)

OR

1. Power maintenance (e.g. marathon, posture)

### Types of Muscle Fibres

- Different fibre types can generate maximum tension, but at different velocities
- Muscles contain a mix of these muscle fibres, but these vary in proportion based on the primary function of the muscle (Postural, Rapid Movements etc.).
- Human muscles contain mainly Type IIx, then IIa an finally, I

# Muscle Power - Effect of Muscle Fibre Type

- In order of Decreasing Maximum Power = IIx → IIa → I due to the type of Myosin Heavy Chain expressed and therefore, the type of Myosin ATPase expressed
- All muscle fibre types can generate the same maximum forces but they generate different powers due to their varying capacities of maximum shortening velocity
- In Elite Marathon Runners, Type I Fibres are mainly present to maximise muscle endurance and In Elite Sprinters, Type IIx and IIa Fibres are mainly present to maximise Muscle Power than can be generated in explosive bursts

![Screenshot 2021-10-07 at 10.47.57.png](%5B021%5D%20Muscle%20Function%20in%20Health%20and%20Disease%203e0f508d79844089b2734cb8bfa0c4db/Screenshot_2021-10-07_at_10.47.57.png)

# Muscle Power - Effect of Sarcomere Arrangement

- In Parallel Muscles, Sarcomeres are organised in Series, connected end to end to one another
- In Pennate Muscles, Sarcomeres are arranged in parallel to one another
- Different Arrangements of Sarcomeres does not impact the Maximum Power that can be generated but does impact the Optimum Velocity at which this power is generated
- When Sarcomeres are arranged in Parallel (Pennate Muscle), the Optimum Contraction Velocity is much less than when Sarcomeres are arranged in series (Parallel Muscles)

![Screenshot 2021-10-07 at 10.53.08.png](%5B021%5D%20Muscle%20Function%20in%20Health%20and%20Disease%203e0f508d79844089b2734cb8bfa0c4db/Screenshot_2021-10-07_at_10.53.08.png)

# Motor Unit Recruitment + Coding and Muscle Adaptability

### Motor Units - Recruitment and Rate Coding

- As contraction continues and greater force is required, more units are recruited and in addition, firing rate ↑ at the same time to generate greater force (this is known as rate coding and recruitment)

### Muscle Adaptability

1. Plasticity: refers to potential to increase muscle size (CSA) and contractile protein composition (fibre phenotype)
2. Fibre type:
- Phenotype of muscle fibre depends on the pattern of neural innervation.
- Changing pattern of neural innervation changes muscle fibre phenotype
- If muscles are innervated by Fast Motor Neurons, they will form Type II Muscle Fibres and if muscles are innervated by Slow Motor Neurons, they will form Type I Muscle Fibres
- Supplying a fast muscle fibre with a slow motor neurone causes fast fibre to become a slow twitch fibre
- This stimulus must be applied consistently.
- As soon as stimulus stops, muscle fibre returns to original phenotype
- Possible to change type IID/X fibre to type IIA fibre and ↑ its fatigue resistance, but we cannot make a type IIA fibre to type I fibre.
- We can change Type I Fibres into Type II Fibres but this is more difficult than going from Type II to I due to the recruitment principle for muscle activation where Type I Fibres are always recruited first as they are innervated by Smaller Motor Units
- Exercise, Electrostimulation, Myotonia (Impaired Muscle Relaxation) and Mechanical Overloading causes muscle fibres to shift towards a Type I/Slow Twitch Phenotype due to Increased Neuromuscular Activity/Loading
- Denervation, Spinal Cord Transection, Detraining/Unloading, Immobilisation, Hindlimb Suspension and Microgravity cause a shift towards Type II Phenotype (and sarcomere loss) due to Decreased Neuromuscular Activity/Loading

![Screenshot 2021-10-07 at 15.26.22.png](%5B021%5D%20Muscle%20Function%20in%20Health%20and%20Disease%203e0f508d79844089b2734cb8bfa0c4db/Screenshot_2021-10-07_at_15.26.22.png)

1. Cross-sectional area:
- Muscle Growth can only occur via a net gain in protein (Increase in Size/Number of Muscle Fibres via Synthesis of New Nuclei, Increased Vascularisation etc.)
- This can be stimulated by IGF-1, Testosterone, Mechanical Stimuli etc by stimulating Satellite Cells and Muscle Fibre Synthesis.
- ↑ cross-sectional area ↑ muscle strength.
- However, gain in muscle strength (Maximum Isometric Force that can be generated) is much greater than gain in ACSA due to muscle training
- This is because of:
1. Improved activation via neural system (Increased neural drive)
2. ↓ drive to antagonist muscles via neural system due to increased agonist activity
3. Changes in pennation angle (Alters the [Muscle Fibre] of the Muscle and hence, PCSA)
4. Loss of intramuscular fat
5. Hypertrophy of individual fibres

![Screenshot 2021-10-07 at 11.08.27.png](%5B021%5D%20Muscle%20Function%20in%20Health%20and%20Disease%203e0f508d79844089b2734cb8bfa0c4db/Screenshot_2021-10-07_at_11.08.27.png)

4.  Neural factors:

- Early increases in Muscle Strength occurs simultaneously with increased neural drive (Neural Adaptation), which precedes fibre hypertrophy
- Neural Adaptation improves muscle strength, increasing its peak after 4-6 weeks so Early Increases in Muscle Strength are due to improved Neural Activation, with Hypertrophy contributing to later increases in Muscle Strength
- The neural adaptations responsible for an early increase in Muscle Strength are:
1. Activation of motor units (rate coding)
2. Involvement of afferent and efferent pathways
3. Synchronisation

# Principles of Strength Training

### Principles of Strength Training:

1. Overload - muscle must be worked at a load that is > than normal. 
- This should be 65-80% of maximum load.
1. Specificity: adaptations occur based on type of training, length-tension relationships and the contraction velocities used
2. Individuality: variability from person-to-person based on
genetics, metabolism, endocrine regulation and relative initial fitness level
3. Reversibility: training effects will be reversed if stop training. Therefore, a Maintenance program is necessary to maintain effects of training

### Ways of ↑ Muscle Force and Strength:

1. Progressive resistance weight training
2. Isometric training (i.e. static)
3. Isokinetic training (i.e. dynamic)
4. Use of weight bearing exercise (i.e. body weight as resistance)
5. Repetition
6. Circuit training
7. Strength training combined with task training
- Different forms of Muscle Training produce different effects on Muscle Properties and therefore, the aim of Muscle Training needs to be identified (Endurance? Power? Skill?)  in order to create an Exercise Regime that will improve the desired results

### Are Elite Athletes Born or Made?:

- Evidence to support nature rather than nurture:
- Studies of identical twins suggest a genetic influence of fibre type proportions
- Studies of endurance training show shift of type IIX towards IIA, but not completely to type I, therefore nurture/training has its limits on increase the fatigue resistance of muscle fibres
- East Africans better at endurance; West Africans better at sprinting
- For both men and women, Force/Tension per Unit Cross Sectional Area is essentially identical. Where Men often have a larger CSA for their muscles (greater muscle bulk) due to the Activity of Testosterone - This is why men are often able to produce Greater Muscle Force/Power than Women

# Ageing

- Young, healthy individuals have strength reserves above level required for daily tasks, which increase in size from birth: more strength than required to carry out daily tasks
- This ensures that when we lose muscle strength as we age, the point in which muscle strength drops below that required for daily activity is postponed until late in life to maintain activity for as long as possible
- Older individuals’ strength ↓ and eventually falls below the level required for carrying out daily tasks
- Ageing appears to occur slower in athletes in sense they show slower decline in muscle strength, with this decline having a later onset but still occurring
- Evidence to suggest possible to delay effects of ageing, by training, even in elderly
- Ageing results in changes to:
1. Neural activation (↓ motor recruitment and rate coding)
2. Muscle fibre cross-sectional area (fibre atrophy)
3. Muscle architecture (E.g Angle of Pennation)
4. Muscle fibre type (preferential loss of type II fibres)
5. Length-tension relationship (loss of elasticity)
6. Muscle function starts to ↓ around 20-30 years of age, decreasing more rapidly after 60 due to loss of Motor Units and Muscle Fibres
7. Possible inappropriate agonist/antagonist coactivation, stiffening joints and reducing power output (reduces distance travelled by muscle due to agonist antagonist opposing one another)
- This leads to Sarcopenia/Loss of Muscle Tissue
- With Ageing, there is preferential loss of Type II Fibres (as these require high neural drive to maintain their phenotype and hence, are most affected when there is Motor Unit Loss).
- This leads to an inability to perform quick postural adjustments, causing stiffening due agonist-antagonist co-contraction, which further restricts movement

# Neurological Disease - Upper Motor Neuron Lesion Vs Lower Motor Neuron Lesion

[Motor Neuron Lesions](%5B021%5D%20Muscle%20Function%20in%20Health%20and%20Disease%203e0f508d79844089b2734cb8bfa0c4db/Motor%20Neuron%20Lesions%209bf99a6a820d462891d523ed5fb28f49.md)

### Cerebral Palsy (Example of UMN Disorder)

- Caused by UMN lesion present before/around birth (usually congenital)
- Leads to musculoskeletal pathology
- Loss of inhibition of lower motor neurons, giving +ve features of UMN syndrome, and results in spasticity and hyper-reflexia
- Loss of connection to lower motor neurons so the reduced drive into the motor neuron pool and reduced motor unit activation causes –ve feature of LMN syndrome, resulting in weakness, fatigability and poor balance
- Histologically, lots of collagen and laminin are seen between muscle fibres, which have become smaller (Reduced CSA) AKA Increased CT and reduced Muscle Mass
- Px with CP also have impaired bone and muscle growth, with fewer Muscle Nuclei and Satellite Cells within their muscles

![Screenshot 2021-10-07 at 11.47.54.png](%5B021%5D%20Muscle%20Function%20in%20Health%20and%20Disease%203e0f508d79844089b2734cb8bfa0c4db/Screenshot_2021-10-07_at_11.47.54.png)

- People with CP have reduced muscle strength at all ages and show a more rapid loss of muscle strength as the individual ages, meaning it takes them longer to do tasks.
- This can be improved with training
- Px with CP often have mainly Type I Muscle Fibres and less Type II Muscle Fibres (Likely due to reduced Neural Drive to muscles)
- There is a correlation between the severity of impairment due to CP and the Reduction in Sarcomere Number and Increase in Sarcomere length (As Sarcomere Number decreases and Sarcomere length increases, severity of CP increases)
