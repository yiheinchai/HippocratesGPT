# [003] Reflexes

# Reflexes

- A reflex is a simple response to sensory input
- They are not under direct control of brain and are involuntary motor acts. Can be subject to modulation by the CNS
- Reflex arcs have a minimum of an afferent and efferent neuron in their neural pathways (these are monosynaptic reflexes): sensory receptor in the periphery → afferent limb/pathway towards the CNS → integrating centre (In the CNS. These are interneurons in the spinal cord for spinal reflexes or neurons in the brain for other reflexes like visual) → efferent limb/pathway from the CNS → effector organ
- The types of integration centres involved in these reflexes are relatively limited and so, reflexes are relatively invariable despite changes in the sensory input/stimulus (usually either produce integration of sensory into motor command or don't)
- Reflexes can be monosynaptic, disynaptic or polysynaptic
- Size of reflex depends on size of stimulus
- Skeletal muscle is neurogenic: can only contract in response to excitation from motoneurons.
- Skeletal muscle reflexes always involve pathways through the spinal cord or brainstem

# Types of Reflexes

1. Protective:
o Eye blink - In response to contact near the eyes, protecting the eye from mechanical damage
o Gag reflex - In response to contact in the Pharynx (near uvula and tonsils), protecting against swallowing bulky/sharp objects
o Limb withdrawal reflex - Protect limb from injury from painful stimuli
2. Regulation (system stabilisation):
o Vestibulo-ocular reflex: Information about head movement (rotational and translational) is conveyed by the Vestibular System of the Inner Ear to the Oculomotor System to produce compensatory eye movement to head movements to maintains/fix gaze
o Muscle-stretch reflex: maintains limb position by taking information from proprioceptors to keep stable muscle length

# Spinal Cord

- Many reflexes are organised (almost in their entirety) at the level of the Spinal Cord
- Sensory/afferent neurons enter the spinal cord/CNS through dorsal horns (afferent pathway)
- Reflexes travel through interneurons in the Grey Matter (where sensory information is processed) and leave through ventral horn as motor neurons (efferent pathway) which run to the periphery
- Motor neurons go through white matter of the ventral horns
- Motor neurons controlling:
1) Distal muscles lie lateral in ventral horns
2) Proximal muscles lie medial in ventral horns
- Motor neurons controlling extensor muscles lies peripherally (further away from the central canal) in the ventral horn, those controlling flexor muscles lie centrally (closer to the central canal) in the ventral horn

# Motor Neuron Pool

- A motor neuron pool consists of all motor neurons that innervate a muscle.
- This pool can occupy/span several spinal segments as many motor neurons are required to control an individual muscle
- Total motor neuron projection to a single muscle is motor neuron pool

# Motor Unit

- A single motor neuron and muscle fibres that it contacts/synapses with is basic unit of motor organisation (motor unit)
- It is the final basic efferent unit of a reflex
- As an AP firing down a Motor Neuron causes contraction of all muscle fibres that it contacts with, a Motor Unit is the smallest unit of motor organisation/force generation
- In a small motor unit (oculomotor system - Medial Rectus Muscle), a single motor neuron may contract 10-20 muscle fibres and motor neuron will be small, with high input resistance (due to small membrane surface area). This produces highly accurate movements. These are capable of producing small peak maximum tensions/forces
- In large motor units (quadriceps), a single motor neuron may contact more than 1000 muscle fibres and the motor neuron will be large, with low input resistance due to a large membrane surface area. These are capable of producing large peak maximum tensions/forces
- In a large muscle that is capable of generating large forces, there is a range of small and large motor units to allow for a smooth gradation of force/muscle generation to be possible upon stimulation of the muscle.
- In very small muscles, capable of generating only small forces, all the motor units are small
- Recruitment of motor units: low levels of activation (weak command/input signal) to a motor neuron pool will activate small, high resistance motor neurons of small motor units.
- Higher levels of activation (stronger command/input signal) will also activate larger, lower resistance motor neurons of larger motor units as well as maximally activating small motor units (Motor Neurons of small motor units reach their maximum firing potential).
- Motor units are recruited with increasing activation according to size principle to generate ↑ amounts of muscle tension/force via summation of the force generated from each motor unit rather than having to select a single motor unit with a peak maximum tension equal to the desired tension.
- Small Motor Neurons (not stimulated via command signals from the CNS) fire APs send out a 'frequency code' to muscle fibres.
- Motor Neurons that have a low unstimulated firing rate produce a sustained muscle contraction.
- Increasing the firing rate of motor neurons increases the muscle tension/force that can be generated up to a peak maximum, determined by the maximum firing rate of the motor neuron.

# Motor Spindle and Golgi Tendon Organs

### Muscle Spindle

- Most muscle fibres generate tension/force upon stimulation/contraction and are innervated by α-Motor Neurons
- Motor Spindle = Small bundle of modified muscle fibres with sensory and motor Innervation.
- They consist of a tendon at one end and are connected an extrafusal muscle fibre at the other (lie in parallel with force-generating fibres).

**Intrafusal:**

- Fibres within muscle spindle
- They contain very little contractility around the central portion of the Spindle but rather, contain lots of afferent/sensory nerve endings
- These detect length and are Mechanoreceptors/stretch receptors, sensitive to physical disturbances.
- Once the intrafusal fibres of the muscle spindle are stretched (due to elongation of extrafusal fibres), afferent nerve endings within the intrafusal fibres are stimulated.
- This causes the intrafusal fibres to fire impulses down afferent axons which run proximally and arrive at spinal cord.
- Firing rate of endings ↑ when spindle is stretched and ↓ when the spindle is shortened (as the spindles are inactivated).
- They stretch when extrafusal fibre elongates and hence, measure the elongation/length status of extrafusal fibres.
- They are dynamic in action.
- γ Motor Neurons innervate the more distal ends of the Intrafusal Muscle Fibres/Spindle and provide minor contractile control over the Intrafusal Muscle Fibres

**Extrafusal:**

- Fibres outside muscle spindle which generate force/muscle tension upon contraction (force-generating).
- They terminate in tendons on each end and run through length of muscle to join to tendon on the other end (muscle contraction pulls the tendon to produce movement).
- Normal spindles do not attach to tendon on both ends, only on one end
- They do not have sensory fibres.
- The centre of muscle spindles have 1a (dynamic) and II fibres (static) which respond to muscle stretch differently.
- 1a afferents are sensitive to rapid/dynamic changes in length/stretch
- Type II Fibres are sensitive to static aspects of extrafusal muscle length, resulting in sustained/long duration signalling to send information regarding the resting length of the system/extrafusal muscle fibres vs changes in muscle stretch/length
- Rate of firing both types is proportional to degree of stretch of muscle spindle at any given moment.

### Golgi Tendon Organs

- These detect changes in muscle tension
- They are found in series with the force generating extrafusal fibres within the muscle tendon.
- Their series positioning allows them to directly measure tension in the muscle system
- When extrafusal fibres contract/a heavy load is placed on a body part, leading to muscle contraction, Golgi Tendon Organs detect the changes in Muscle Tension within the Tendon and send this information into the Spinal Cord via afferent axons
- One tendon contains multiple Golgi Tendon Organs

# Tendon Jerk Reflex - Muscle Stretch Reflex

- Receptor is muscle spindle (not Golgi tendon organ despite being called Tendon Jerk Reflex as Tendon Tapping stretches muscle spindle)
1. Fast conducting 1a afferents from the agonist muscle spindles respond to increased muscle stretch (when additional load is applied). 
2. These afferents enter the spinal cord through the dorsal root and make monosynaptic connections with α motor neurons supplying same agonist muscle and any synergist muscles within the Grey Matter
- This is the only monosynaptic connection/reflex in body
1. 1a afferents also synapse with 1a inhibitory interneuron (GABAergic) that synapses with and inhibits α-motor neurons that supply antagonistic muscles.
- This causes a reflex relaxation of the antagonistic muscle and this reflex is known as reciprocal stretch reflex. This means during tendon jerk reflex, when bicep/agonist contracts, triceps/antagonist is also not contracting.
- This muscle stretch reflex is the fastest reflex in the body as the 1a afferent and α-motor neurons are big and myelinated and hence, has a very high conduction velocity through the afferent and efferent limbs and across the monosynaptic connection.
- The monosynaptic nature of the reflex means it is very fast and relatively invariant across different muscles
- The 1a afferent is the largest diameter and hence, fastest conducting axon in the nervous system. The α-motor neuron is the second largest diameter and hence, fastest conducting axon in the nervous system.
- Information from muscle spindles feeds rapidly into the Muscle Stretch Reflex/Tendon Jerk Reflex as well as being sent to the Brainstem, Cerebellum and Somatosensory Cortex in slower pathways
- The contraction of the agonist produced by the Muscle Stretch Reflex reduces the stretch of the agonist back to its resting state, ensuring muscle length remains constant (removes additional muscle stretch) in a negative feedback loop.
- The accuracy of this reflex is further increased in accuracy by the presence of muscle spindles in the antagonist as well as the agonist.
- Primary purpose to help maintain limb position as the magnitude of loads vary (allows muscle tension to vary according to load magnitude)
- It can maintain the limb position produced by muscle contraction initiated via a command signal from a motor neuron E.g Corticospinal Tract
- The muscle stretch reflex is also known as the Tendon Jerk reflex as it can be tested by tapping the tendon with a tendon hammer to stretch the muscle and rapidly activate the muscle spindles/1a afferents
- Tapping tendon causes agonist muscle (and muscle spindle) to stretch. As the muscle fibres stretch, intrafusal (sensory) fibres detect stretch of extrafusal fibres.
- Tap on tendon can be used to test function of nerves at spinal level and the integrity of the components of the Muscle Stretch Reflex (1a afferent, Monosynaptic Connection, α-Motor Neuron) – Knee and Bicep Jerk Reflex

# Spindles Activated in Passive Stretch (E.g Adding Mass)

- α motor neurons control the length and tension of extrafusal fibres (second fastest neuron in the body)
- Passive Stretch is when an external load is placed on a muscle, which in turn stretches it (E.g Muscle is stretched because of the action of an external force vs another muscle).
- Active Stretch is when a muscle is stretched due to the contraction of another muscle that produces an opposing action (E.g Agonist Stretch as antagonist contracts)
- γ motor neurons control the length and tension of intrafusal fibres
- In passive stretch, both intrafusal and extrafusal fibres are stretched and the spindles are activated. 1a afferents are activated and there is secondary contraction via α motor neurons to maintain constant muscle length and remove additional stretch
- Tension generated during passive stretch is too weak to activate Golgi tendon organ.
- To maintain position of arm when holding an object: adding mass causes biceps to relax slightly (stretch). Intrafusal fibres detect this and 1a fibres synapse with α motor neurons, telling bicep to contract, to maintain position.

# Spindles in Active Contraction (E.g Flexed Elbow) - Active Contraction with Gamma Coactivation

- If a muscle (extrafusal fibres) contract (due to α motor neuron activation by the descending motor tracts like the Corticospinal Tract vs via reflex activation), in theory, spindle fibre would become slack and pulled less tense (as contraction of muscle moves muscle attachment site of Intrafusal Spindle Fibre closer to its tendinous attachment).
- In reality, there is residual contraction of spindle fibre during active contraction to ensure that it maintains its tension and hence, is still able to detect passive stretch (i.e. not slack) during active muscle contraction.
- α and γ motor neurons are co-activated by Descending Motor Tracts during α-motor neuron mediated active muscle contraction to ensure that sensory spindle fibres contract when extrafusal fibres contract, allowing the sensory spindle fibres to remain taunt and detect (passive) stretch.
- This α-γ co-activation (Active Contraction with γ coactivation) allows for fine motor control/sensitive movement (allows detection of additional passive stretch during situations of active contraction)
- If the load is too great, tension is high enough to activate Golgi tendon, leading to relaxation

# Reciprocal Inhibition of the Antagonist in the Muscle Stretch Reflex

- Many Descending Motor Pathways synapse directly on motor neurons and interneurons which in turn synapse on motor neurons.
- These pathways can either activate or deactivate these neurons
- Reciprocal Inhibition of the Antagonist during the Muscle Stretch Reflex can sometimes be switched off to increase the rigidity of the joint to prepare/stabilise it for an unexpected heavy load whilst maintaining hand/limb positioning
- When Reciprocal Inhibition of the Antagonist is switched off, the Agonist and Antagonist contract, increasing the rigidity and stability of the joint in preparation for the addition of a heavy load
- This occurs alternately when walking down the stairs to maintain the stiffness of the knee joint to withstand the load of the body as an individual steps down

# Golgi Tendon Organ and the Tendon-Organ Reflex

- Golgi Tendon Organs (GTOs) are tension-sensitive receptor reports tension during isometric contraction where there is no change in muscle length
- They are comprised of collagen fibres which lie between the ends of the Muscle Fibres and start of the tendons, intermingled with 1b afferent nerve endings
- 1b afferents are just smaller in diameter to 1a afferents but are large diameter and fast conducting
- An increase in tension compresses the nerve endings, sending signals through 1b afferents into the Spinal Cord.
- The 1b afferents activate a 1b inhibitory interneuron, which inhibits  α-motor neurons, leading to muscular relaxation.
- Golgi tendon organ is inhibitory of contraction.
- This is not a monosynaptic pathway, as was case with tendon jerk reflex
- Golgi tendon organ reflex is an inverse myotatic reflex - inverse of a stretch reflex. It is a protective measure at very high muscle tensions, heavily modulated by descending pathways to finely regulate (fine tune) muscle tension/force generation
- Threshold for tendon organ reflex is higher. Once tension is too high there can be a ↓ in contraction due to GTO activation (can be seen to be a protective action).
- This is seen in the Clasp-Knife Reflex of the Elbow where strong pulling of the forearm towards the body causes in muscle relaxation and rapid arm flexion
- Golgi tendon organ through 1b fibres. 1b inhibitor interneuron to motor neuron to agonistic muscle. Causes inhibition of agonist muscle (i.e. relax). Bicep relaxes.

# Flexion Withdrawal and Crossed-Extension Reflex

- This does not involve proprioceptors (does not regulate fibre length and tension) and is a rapid defensive reflex (E.g stepping on sharp object)
- Painful stimulation to lower limb produces flexion withdrawal of stimulated limb and extension of contralateral limb.
1. Sensory event/stimulus leads to a nociceptive input via Aδ afferents from nociceptors.
2. Nociceptors detect high level somatosensory input that could lead to tissue damage - Pain receptors are a subclass of these and are found in the skin
3. Nociceptive Aδ afferents enter the spinal cord, where a complex structure/arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons is found.
4. Aδ Afferents synapse on excitatory interneurons, some of which that then synapse on ipsilateral inhibitory interneurons controlling α-motor neurons controlling extensor muscles and ipsilateral excitatory interneurons controlling α-motor neurons controlling flexor muscles on the limb ipsilateral to the nociceptive stimulus
5. This inhibits extensor muscles and activates flexor muscles, leading to knee flexion, moving the limb away from the painful stimulus
6. Interneurons that Aδ fibres synapse on further synapse on  interneurons that decussate through the spinal cord grey matter to synapse on inhibitory interneurons controlling α-motor neurons controlling contralateral flexor muscles and excitatory interneurons controlling α-motor neurons controlling contralateral extensor muscles
7. This activates contralateral extensor muscles and inhibits contralateral flexor muscles, leading to extension of the contralateral limb
- Extension of the Contralateral Limb occurs to prepare it for an increased load, to support the whole body weight following the withdrawal of the other limb.
- This reflex does not contain a mirror image that would reverse the movements produced as the purpose of the reflex is to move away from the nociceptive stimulus - as the mirror image would cause movement towards the stimulus, this would be damaging and hence, is not needed.
- This circuitry is not present in a mirror image on the ipsilateral limb but is found in the same arrangement on the contralateral limb in case there is a noxious stimulus on the contralateral limb.
- Alternate activation of the Flexion Withdrawal and Crossed-Extension Reflex between both lower limbs produces a stepping action that is used to control walking
