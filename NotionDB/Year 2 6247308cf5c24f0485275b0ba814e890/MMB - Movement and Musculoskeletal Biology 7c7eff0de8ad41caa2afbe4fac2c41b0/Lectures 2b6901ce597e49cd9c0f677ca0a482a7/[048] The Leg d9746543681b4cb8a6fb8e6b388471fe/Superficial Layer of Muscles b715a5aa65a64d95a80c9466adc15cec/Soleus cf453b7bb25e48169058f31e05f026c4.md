# Soleus

Action: Powerfully Plantarflex the Foot
Extra Info: - Deepest muscle of the Superficial Group of the Posterior Compartment                                           - It is a flat muscle, found deep to Gastrocnemius and Plantaris                                   - It forms a tendinous arch between the Tibia and Fibula which is a very important marker as many of the major neurovascular structures (Popliteal Vessels and Tibial Nerve) from the popliteal fossa leave the popliteal fossa by going underneath the tendinous arch                                            - It does not cross the Knee so only Plantarflexes the Foot                                                - To test its integrity, the patient flexes the knee (nullifies action of gastrocnemius) and plantarflexes the foot against resistance                 - Soleus is much weaker than gastrocnemius, but tires less and is therefore responsible for maintaining posture when standing whilst gastrocnemius is responsible for carrying out locomotion
Innervation: Tibial Nerve (S1 and S2)
Insertion: Calcaneus via the Calcaneal Tendon
Origin: Soleal Line of the Tibia, Tendinous Arch and Posterior Fibula
