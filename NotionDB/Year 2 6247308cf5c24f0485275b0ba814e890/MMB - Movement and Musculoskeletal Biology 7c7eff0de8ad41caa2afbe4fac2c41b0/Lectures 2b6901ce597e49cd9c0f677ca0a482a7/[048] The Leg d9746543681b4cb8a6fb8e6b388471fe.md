# [048] The Leg

# Note

- The leg is technically the portion between the knee and the ankle
- There are two different types of terminology:
- Fibularis = Peroneus
- Fibular = Peroneal
- They both refer to structures on the lateral side of the leg
- The leg communicates with the thigh via the popliteal fossa
- It communicates distally with the foot, with a number of structures, including the tarsal tunnel which is the most important

---

# Shaft and Distal Tibia and Fibula

### Tibia - More Medial Bone

- It is much larger throughout its entire length than the fibula
- It is expanded at both ends for the purposes of weight-bearing
- It is the main weight-bearing bone of the leg
- Only the tibia participates in the knee joint, the head of the fibula articulates with the side of the tibia
- The shaft of the tibia has a very prominent and sharp anterior crest/margain:
• This can be palpated along the entire course of the front of the leg
• There is no muscle, simply skin and superficial fascia covering it
- On the posterosuperior surface, the tibia has a diagonal soleal line which is an area of muscle attachment
- On the expanded distal end of the Tibia, there is a bony extension on the Medial Side called the Medial Malleolus, which can be palpated. It articulates with the Talus to form the Majority of the Ankle Joint
- On the posterior surface of the Distal Tibia, lateral to the Medial Malleolus, there is a groove for the attachment of Tibialis Posterior.
- On the Lateral surface of the Distal Tibia, a small notch can be found which articulate switch the distal end of the Fibula

### Fibula - More Lateral Bone

- This is much thinner and not weight-bearing
- The Fibula is expanded at each end to form 2 heads which articulate with the lateral side of the tibia. At its proximal head, it does not participate in the knee joint (it solely articulates with the tibia proximally).
- At its distal end, the Fibula drops down below the distal end of the tibia and forms a lateral projection called the lateral malleolus, which can also be palpated and is visible on the outside of the ankle
- It also participates in the ankle joint but clasps the lateral side of the Talus, making a minor contribution to the Ankle Joint
- They therefore both participate in the ankle joint
- It has a groove on its posterior surface for peroneus longus and brevis

### Interosseous Membrane

- The bones are bound together along most of their length by an tough interosseous membrane, which acts a large area of muscle attachment
- This is a thick connective tissue sheet
- There are holes in it:
• At the top, for the anterior tibial vessels
• At the bottom, for the perforating branch of the Fibular Artery

### Distal Tibia and Fibula

- The tibia and fibula are joined together at their proximal and distal ends:
• The proximal/superior joint is synovial
• The distal/superior joint is fibrous (syndesmosis)
- They are further bound together by the anterior and posterior tibiofibular ligaments
- There is no mobility between the tibia and the fibula at either the superior or inferior tibiofibular joints, unlike the radius and ulna
- The tibia forms the vast majority of the surface area for the ankle joint, the fibula simply comes in and clasps it from the side

# Tarsals

- Most of the muscles in the leg, cross the ankle and act on the foot and toes
- There are 7 tarsal/ankle bones:
- There are 8 carpal bones, only including the pisiform bone
- In a way, there are therefore the same number of carpal and tarsal bones developmentally
- They are roughly arranged into three rows, of proximal, intermediate and distal bones
- There are then 5 metatarsals that form the long bones of the foot
- There are 14 phalanges:
• Digits II – V have three phalanges each (Proximal, Middle and Distal)
• Digit I (Big toe) only has two phalanges (Proximal and Distal)
- Due to the differences in rotation of the limbs:
• Digit I – V goes from lateral to medial in the hand
• Digit I – V goes from medial to lateral in the foot
    
    ![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_11.43.50.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_11.43.50.png)
    

### Proximal Rows of Tarsals

- This consists of the talus and calcaneus
- These are the two largest bones

**Talus**

- The talus is the bone that forms the articulation with the ankle joint
- It is the only tarsal bone that participates in the ankle joint
- Its head is anteroinferiorly orientated and articulates with the navicular
- Its neck connects the head to a fairly massive, expanded body
- The superior surface of the talus forms the trochlea, which is the articular surface with the tibia and fibula. It is bounded medially and laterally by the Medial and Lateral Malleoli
- The Inferior surface of the Talus articulates with the superior surface of the Calcaneus
    
    ![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_11.26.44.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_11.26.44.png)
    

**Calcaneus**

- The calcaneus is the largest of the tarsal bones
- It forms the heel bone
- It articulates with the cuboid anteriorly and the navicular superiorly
- It has a large tuberosity that projects posteriorly, which is what you palpate when you feel your heel bone - The Achilles’ tendon attaches here
- In animals that run or dig, the olecranon is extended to increase the mechanical advantage of the triceps muscles
- The calcaneus here does the same thing, it is extended backwards to provide a longer lever to convey mechanical advantage to the calf muscles
- There is a medial shelf that is found inferior to and holds up/articultes with the talus called the sustenaculum tali
- The inferior surface of the Sustenaculum Tali has a groove for the tendon of flexor hallucis longus
    
    ![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_11.31.27.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_11.31.27.png)
    

### Intermediate Row

**Navicular**

- It is boat-shaped
- It articulates posteriorly with the talus and anteriorly with the distal row of tarsal bones

### Distal Row

**Cuboid**

- This is the most lateral bone and is longer than the Navicular
- It is roughly square/cube-shaped
- It articulates posteriorly with the calcaneus and anteriorly with two of the metatarsals
- It has a groove on its inferior surface for fibularis/peroneus longus

**Lateral, Intermediate and Medial Cuneiforms**

- These are wedge-shaped
- They articulate posteriorly with the navicular and distally with the metatarsals
- These articulate laterally and medially with one another and anteriorly with the metatarsals

# Talocrural/Ankle Joint Proper

- The main ankle joint is a synovial joint between the talus, tibia and fibula
- The head of the talus is a half-cylinder/saddle shape and it fits into a complementary socket on the bottom of the tibia, which is similarly curved ('bracket-shaped').
- Due to the structure of the Joint articulation, is a fairly rigid hinge joint which only permits plantarflexion (toes down) and dorsiflexion (toes up) of the foot
- The lateral malleolus of the fibula and the medial malleolus of the tibia clasp the joint on either side

![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_12.09.27.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_12.09.27.png)

---

# Movements and Stability of the Ankle

### Dorsiflexion and Plantarflexion

- The trochlea/articular surface of the talus is wider anteriorly than it is posteriorly
- When the foot is dorsiflexed so that the Anterior portion of the Trochlea is in contact with the Malleoli, there is the maximum amount of contact between the joint surfaces and the grip of the lateral and medial malleoli are tightest
- The ankle joint is therefore at its most stable during dorsiflexion
- When the foot is plantarflexed, it is the narrow posterior end of the trochlea in the joint in contact with the Malleoli, which means there is less contact between the joint surfaces and the grip between the lateral and medial malleoli is looser
- The ankle joint is at its least stable during plantarflexion soost ankle injuries occur during plantarflexion
- Plantarflexion of the foot can be used to test the S1 and S2 Myotomes

![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_12.11.23.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_12.11.23.png)

### Other Movements

- Only Plantar/Dorsiflexion occur at the Ankle Joint Proper, the other movements do not occur at the ankle joint proper but within other joints between some of the ankle bones
- Some of the muscles of the leg power these movements
- Inversion/eversion is the turning of the sole of the foot either inwards or outwards so that the sole of the foot faces medially/laterally respectively
- Pronation/supination is the swinging of the toes laterally or medially relative to the ankle or leg
- Pronation is turning outwards whilst supination is turning them inwards

# Ligaments of the Ankle

- As with many joints, they are stabilised with ligaments
- It has both medial and lateral ligaments
- They are both compound ligaments made up of many other different ligaments

**Medial/Deltoid Ligament**

- As a whole, it is very broad and strong
- It is roughly triangular in shape with the apex connecting to the medial malleolus
- Inferiorly, it divides into four parts, named after the bones to which they attach:
1. Anterior and posterior tibiotalar ligaments which go from the medial malleolus to the anterior and posterior surfaces of the talus
2. The tibiocalcaneal ligament goes from the medial malleolus and attaches to the sustenaculum tali of the calcaneus
3. The tibionavicular connects the navicular bone as well as the spring ligament
4. The plantar calcaneonavicular ligament is synonymous with the spring ligament

**Lateral ligament**

- This comes off of the lateral malleolus which is part of the fibula
- It consists of three parts:
1. Calcaneofibular ligament - Attaches to the Calcaneus
2. Anterior Talofibular Ligament - Attaches to the anterior surface of the Talus
3. Posterior Talofibular ligaments - The posterior talofibular almost wraps around the back of the ankle to attach to the posterior surface of the Talus

![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_12.18.46.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_12.18.46.png)

### Ankle Sprain

- A sprained ankle is either a partial or complete tear of one of the ankle ligaments due to stretching of ligament fibres
- They often result from twisting the ankle on a weightbearing plantarflexed foot
- The direction of the twist determines which ligament is damaged
- A common injury is an inversion injury where the foot is twisted inwards/inversion, where the anterior talofibular ligament (a component of the lateral ligament) is damaged

---

# Lower Limb Evolution (Covered Previously)

- The leg is divided into compartments
- In mammals, the limbs have twisted which means the developmentally dorsal and ventral compartments have moved
- The developmentally dorsal muscles become anterior and lateral
- The developmentally ventral muscles become posterior and medial

![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_12.26.03.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_12.26.03.png)

### Compartments of the Limb

- The thigh has a large anterior compartment which was developmentally dorsal, and a posterior compartment which is developmentally posterior and medial
- The leg has lateral and anterior compartments which are developmentally dorsal and a posterior compartment which is developmentally ventral
- There is no medial compartment in the leg

![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_12.27.58.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_12.27.58.png)

# Compartments of the Leg

- The compartments are formed by the tibia and fibula
- There is no muscle in front of the shaft of the tibia and fibula
- The interosseous membrane separates the posterior and anterior compartments. There is also a lateral compartment
- The deep fascia (fascia lata in the thigh and crural fascia in leg), helps to divide the leg into compartments as it sends out Intramuscular septa, whilst surrounding the muscles of the leg.
- Some of these intramuscular septa can also divide the different layers within a single compartment (most notably within the Posterior Compartment)

### **Posterior Compartments (green)**

- This is the largest compartment
- The muscles act as plantarflexors, toe flexors or inverters
- They are supplied by the tibial nerve (tibial division of sciatic nerve)
- They are all supplied by the posterior tibial artery

### Anterior Compartment (light red)

- The muscles act as dorsiflexors, toe extensors or inverters
- They are all inverted by the deep peroneal/fibular nerve
- They are all supplied by the anterior tibial artery

### Lateral Compartment (red)

- Smallest compartment of the Leg
- The muscles act as evertors of the foot
- They are innervated by the superficial peroneal nerve
- They are supplied by the perforating branches of the anterior tibial and peroneal arteries

# Muscles of the Posterior Leg

- They are roughly divided into a superficial and deep group
- The superficial group can be called triceps surae

[Superficial Layer of Muscles](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Superficial%20Layer%20of%20Muscles%20b715a5aa65a64d95a80c9466adc15cec.md)

**Deep Group Insertions - Previously Mentioned**

- The tendons all curl around the medial malleolus and travel into the foot via the Tarsal Tunnel
- Flexor hallucis longus runs to the big toe
- Flexor digitorum longus runs to the other four bones
- Tibialis posterior inserts into the navicular and medial cuneiform

![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_13.36.39.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_13.36.39.png)

# Muscles of the Lateral Leg

- They both act to evert the leg and are both innervated by the superficial peroneal nerve (L5, S1 and S2)

[Untitled](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Untitled%20Database%20b9c76166c23c4ee4abf966d6af13d12f.md)

---

# Muscles of the Anterior Leg

- These muscles arise from the lateral side of the tibia or the medial side of the fibula, none of them arise from the medial side of the tibia as it is just bone-deep to the skin
- All of the muscles of the anterior compartment are innervated by the deep peroneal/fibular nerve

[Untitled](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Untitled%206fc417c6254647ac9109dc3b432886b9.md)

### Anterior Compartment Insertions on the Foot

- Tibialis anterior attaches to the plantar/inferior surface of the foot at the medial cuneiform and 1st metatarsal

# Blood Supply of the Leg

### Posterior and Lateral Compartments

- The femoral artery goes through the femoral triangle and adductor canal and comes out to the popliteal fossa where it becomes the popliteal artery
- The popliteal artery goes under the tendinous arch of the soleus muscle
- Usually below the arch, it will divide into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries

**The Anterior Tibial Artery**

- This passes through the superior hole in the interosseous membrane to enter the anterior compartment

**The Posterior Tibial Artery**

- This supplies blood to the posterior and lateral compartments
- It enters the foot via the tarsal tunnel
- It gives off a peroneal/Fibular artery high up which travels laterally down the leg and sends some branches to the lateral compartment
- The peroneal/Fibular artery gives off a perforating branch that goes through the inferior hole of the interosseous membrane
- This forms an anastomosis with the Anterior Tibial Artery between the anterior and posterior compartments of the leg

![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_14.37.52.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_14.37.52.png)

### Anterior and Lateral Compartments

- The anterior tibial artery supplies anterior compartment muscles and sends some perforating branches to  the lateral compartment
- It travels down the Anterior surface of the Interosseous Membrane, between the tendons of Tibialis Anterior and Extensor Hallucis Longus, as it gives out branches to supply adjacent muscles
- It is joined by the perforating branch of the Fibular artery at the bottom of the leg which it anastamoses with near the Inferior Opening in the Interosseous Membrane.
- Near the Ankle, it gives rise to which are the anterior medial and anterior lateral malleolar arteries. These pass around the ends of the Tibia and Fibula and contribute to an anastomosis around the Ankle Joint
- It continues into the foot, crossing the dorsum/anterior aspect of the foot laterally where its name becomes dorsalis pedis.

# Tibial Artery Pulses

### Posterior Tibial Artery

- This can be felt behind the medial malleolus and midway between the medial malleolus and
calcaneus
- This travels in the tarsal tunnel
    
    ![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_14.42.33.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_14.42.33.png)
    

### Anterior Tibial Artery (Technically of Dorsalis Pedis)

- This is best felt on the dorsal surface of the foot between the tendons of extensor digitorum longus and extensor hallucis longus
    
    ![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_14.43.12.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_14.43.12.png)

# Veins of the Leg

- The deep veins of all 3 compartments of the leg follow the deep arteries of that compartment and have similar names
- There is a huge network of superficial veins
- The most important superficial veins are the great saphenous (medial aspect of the leg) and small saphenous (back of the leg). The Small Saphenous vein eventually drains into the Popliteal Vein within the Popliteal Fossa whilst the Great Saphenous Vein drains into the Femoral Vein within the Femoral Triangle

![%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_14.45.36.png](%5B048%5D%20The%20Leg%20d9746543681b4cb8a6fb8e6b388471fe/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_14.45.36.png)

- They send blood to deep veins via perforating veins along the length of the lower limb
- The perforating veins have valves which mean that blood can only flow superficial to deep
- This, along with the thick fascia is another way of trying to encourage blood return from the legs
- If these valves fail/become incompetent, blood struggles to flow upwards against gravity. This results in varicose veins which affect the superficial veins of the legs, where the blood is just pooling within these veins rather than flowing, causing the veins to become distended

# Nerve Supply to the Posterior Compartment of the Leg

- The tibial division of the sciatic nerve travels through the Popliteal Fossa alongside the Popliteal Vessels. It then passes under the tendinous arch alongside the Posterior Tibial Artery, down the back of the leg and innervating the back of the leg to innervate the entire posterior compartment
- It gives off two cutaneous branches:
1) Sural nerve: It travels between the two heads of gastrocnemius with the small saphenous vein and it supplies the skin on the lower posterolateral leg and lateral side of the foot
2) Medial calcaneal nerve: This originates near the ankle and innervates skin on the medial foot and sole
- It eventually passes behind the medial malleolus through the tarsal tunnel to enter the foot

# Nerve Supply to the Lateral Compartment of the Leg

- The other major branch of the sciatic nerve is the common fibular nerve
- The common fibular nerve can be found underneath the lateral aspect of biceps femoris and travels just lateral to the Fibula.
- As it travels inferomedially around the head of the Fibula (before reaching the knee joint), It gives off two sensory branches :
1) Lateral sural nerve which innervates a patch of skin on the superolateral part of the leg
2) Communicating sural nerve which joins up with the true sural nerve off the tibial division
- When it passes around the head of the fibula, it is at risk of injury
- As it enters the Lateral Compartment of the Leg, the common fibular nerve then divides into the superficial and deep fibular nerve
- The superficial fibular nerve innervates the two muscles of the lateral compartment and supplies the skin on the dorsum of the foot by passing through the tarsal tunnel whereas the Deep Fibular Nerve passes into and supplies the anterior compartment of the Leg

# Nerve Supply to the Anterior Compartment of the Leg

- The deep Fibular nerve supplies the anterior compartment as well as some of the muscles on the dorsum of the foot and some of the intrinsic muscles of the foot (Extensor Digitorum Brevis and First 2 Dorsal Interossei)
- It supplies the skin between the first and second toes
- It is a branch of the Common Fibular Nerve and passes through the Intermuscular Septum of the Leg to descend with the Anterior Tibial Artery on the Anterior surface of the Interosseous Membrane.

# Cutaneous Nerves of the Leg

- Much of the medial side of the leg and foot is supplied by the saphenous nerve which comes off the femoral nerve
- The Common Fibular Nerve supplies the lateral leg + ankle and the dorsal/anterior  aspect of the foot (except the little toe and the skin between Toes I and 2)
- The deep fibular branch supplies skin between the first and second toes
- The tibial nerve innervates the posterolateral aspects of the foot as well as skin of the Ankle, Little Toe and sole of the foot
