# [033] Degenerative Conditions of Joints

# Joints

### Types

- Synovial joints: moveable in one or more axes
- Synarthrose: fibrous joint permitting very little or no movement (i.e. sutures of skull)

### Joint Structure (Synovium)

- 2 Types of Cells line the Synovium/Synovial Membrane:
- Type A cells: macrophages containing lysosomal enzymes to break down foreign material that enters the joint space
- Type B cells: secrete hyaluronic acid
- Synovial surface is villous, if flattened will cover 100 m²

### Function of the Synovium

1. Control of diffusion in and out of joint
2. Ingestion of debris
3. Secretion of hyaluronate, immunoglobulins, lysosomal enzymes
4. Lubrication of joint
5. Providing nourishment for avascular articular cartilage via Synovial Fluid

### Structure of a Synovial Joint

- Synovial Fluid fills the Synovial Joint Space between articulating bones
- As fluids are almost incompressible, the 2 articulating bones do not touch, minimising friction erosion of articular cartilage
- When there is loss of Synovial Fluid, the Articular Cartilage surfaces touch one another and begin to get eroded as the joint articulates
- This articular cartilage damage cannot be repaired naturally as the avascularity of cartilage means it has very little reparative capacity

# Articular Cartilage

- Collagen (90% of type II)
- Proteoglycan
- Chondrocytes - Involved in protein synthesis, phagocytosis
- 70-80% water by weight - Ensures cartilage does not become dry, brittle and easily eroded
- Damage to articular cartilage can be serious and irreversible

---

# Degenerative Joint Disease

- Joint mobility depends on lubricity of cartilage surfaces bathed in synovial fluid
- Cartilage function depends on proteoglycan (which is hydrophilic contained by collagen fibres) drawing water into substance of tissue
- Changes in proteoglycan and collagen results in loss of water and therefore, of cartilage resilience/strength and occurs with age

---

# Primary Osteoarthritis (Osteoarthrosis)

- Sometimes known as Osteoarthrosis as it is not an inflammatory disease (as is suggested by -itis)
- Loss of Articular Cartilage from contact points in joints
- Sometimes familial where there is an intrinsic defect of joint or its cartilage
- Incidence ↑ with age (wear and tear with excessive use of a joint)
- Resilience of Cartilage decreases with age due to increased cross-linking of Collagen Fibres with age, causing the cartilage to dry out and become more friable
- More common in females - Due to genetics and as females tend to have a higher ratio of Weight:Muscle Strength and hence, the joint is subject to more trauma/stress during movement
- Best way to reduce development of Osteoarthitis is exercising to increase muscle tone (as most of the load on joints is absorbed by muscles) and stretch and weight loss to reduce load/stress on joints
- Affects multiple joints bilaterally
- Heberden’s nodes - osteophytes (hard or bony swelling) of distal interphalangeal joints
- Localised/focal distribution of Osteophytes in Osteoarthritis (Heberden's Nodes) shows that Osteoarthritis isn't solely due to wear and tear or trauma (Or else lesions would be more widespread)

### Signs and Symptoms

- Pain that is worse during movement and relieved by rest
- Stiffness
- Crepitus (cracking) on movement due to grating of directly articulating bone
- Limitation of movement due to Osteophyte formation
- Compression of spinal nerve roots (notably in Lumbar region, causing Sciatica) if Osteophytes form along the Vertebral Column

# Pathologies of Osteoarthritis & Radiographic Features

### Articular Cartilage Pathologies

- Flaking: small pieces of Cartilage are phagocytosed, leaving large pieces floating in the Synovial Cavity
- This occurs primarily due to the loss of proteoglycans

![Screenshot 2021-10-14 at 09.41.13.png](%5B033%5D%20Degenerative%20Conditions%20of%20Joints%20dcacca2a1fc746a580460582d0df11e9/Screenshot_2021-10-14_at_09.41.13.png)

- Fibrillation: Cartilage develops spiky, brush-border like appearance

![Screenshot 2021-10-14 at 09.42.28.png](%5B033%5D%20Degenerative%20Conditions%20of%20Joints%20dcacca2a1fc746a580460582d0df11e9/Screenshot_2021-10-14_at_09.42.28.png)

- Eburnation: Cartilage is completely eroded away, causing the Cortical Bone to appear like Polished Ivory
- After Eburnation, Cortical Bone thickens as it must bear more weight.
- Cortical Bone becomes smooth with the bone-on-bone articulation at the joint eventually grinding down the articulating bone surfaces until they are flat
- This leads to a Grating sensation as polished bone is not slippery due to loss of smooth articular cartilage and Synovial Fluid
- The Periosteum is sensitive to pain and hence, this bone-on-bone articulation due to Eburnation is extremely painful, leading to reduced usage of the joint by the Px
- This acts in a positive feedback cycle where OA commonly affects joints involved in movement (E.g Knee Joint), leading to reduced mobility and weight gain, increasing the strain placed on the joint and the pain experienced upon movement
- This eventually causes the Px to become completely immobile, hence worsening the degenerative joint disease
- If OA is treated by Joint Replacement (E.g Knee), it is important to maintain the mobility of the joint in order to build up muscle tone and lose weight to allow the Px to regain function of the joint again

### Bone Pathology

- Thickening of subchondral trabeculae
- Bone-on-Bone Articulation in OA causes grooving of bone surface
- Where these grooves fit in to one another, this reduces the range of movements possible at the joint by making the joint act as a simple hinge joint
- Cracking of bone cortex allows synovial fluid to escape into the bone (forming subchondral cystic spaces), reducing the volume of Synovial Fluid in the Synovial Joint Cavity, which increases the degree of contact between the Articulating Bone Surfaces
- Grinding of Articulating bone surfaces can be felt on examination when passively moving the joint

### Radiographic Features of Osteoarthritis

1. Sclerosis - Bone increases in density and mass/hardness, causing bone to appear more radioopaque on X-Ray 
2. Osteophytes - Bony projections from the margins of the articular surfaces, formed in attempt to widen the articulating surface to reduce the pressure exerted on the Articulating Surface
- Osteophytes restrict movement and are more common as you age, explaining the restriction in joint movement with age
1. Subchondral cysts - Found in the end of the bone, where Synovial Fluid enters the bone and accumulates
2. Loss of joint space (Direct Opposition of Articulating Surfaces)

# Secondary Osteoarthritis

- Degenerative changes in joints previously damaged by other disease process
- Diseases which may lead to secondary degenerative changes:
1. Septic arthritis
2. Tuberculous arthritis
3. Rheumatoid arthritis
4. Gout
5. Congenital dislocation of hip

---

# Rheumatoid Disease

- Systemic chronic inflammatory disease
- Can occur at any age but prevalence ↑ with age, M:F 1:3
- Variable course, alternating between remissions and acute exacerbations (Unlike OA which is constantly progressive)
- Probably a heterogeneous group of disorders

### Clinical Features

- It also affects the eyes, pericardium and the pleura
- Valgus deformity: normally in MCP joint, causing Ulnar Deviation/Hand Adduction
- Thumb also appears hyperextended at the IP Joint but flexed at the CMC Joint (Boutonniere Deformity)

### Pathogenesis

- Half of risk is genetic (HLA Dw4)
- Autoimmunity: rheumatoid factor is multiple antibodies to Fc fragment of IgG
- Cell-mediated immunity: T lymphocytes in synovium
- Abnormal B cell – T cell interaction stimulating release of TNF and other cytokines
- Infectious agents (EBV or other viruses)

### Pathology

- Synovial inflammation: pannus (abnormal layer of granulation tissue and neutrophils in the joint space)
- Inflammation of Synovium causes erosion of adjacent bone
- Joint destruction and fibrous fusion
- Systemic:
1. Rheumatoid nodules - Type of granuloma, commonly found in subcutaneous tissue of the elbow
2. Vasculitis

---

# Hip Dysplasia

- Congenital dislocation of hip
- This affects babies, where their femoral heads easily slip in and out of their Acetabulum (Dislocated) due to deformities in the shape of the Acetabulum and Femoral Head
- This is something which is checked at birth to ensure they do not have CDH - This is done by laying the child down on their back, lifting their legs up and circumducting the thigh to rotate the hips/femoral head and checking if an audible clicking sound is made (Dx of CDH)
- CDH is fixed by immobilising the hip joint until the bones involved in this articulation have properly fused and ossified
- If this is not identified and treated early, the Femoral Head will become displaced and as a result, become ischaemic and change shape (become deformed).
- Femoral Head becomes necrotic as retroactive blood supply of Femoral Head (Up the Femoral Neck) means that Displacement of the Femoral Head will lead to necrosis

- This will cause an abnormal articulation at the Hip Joint, leading to Secondary OA
- Necrosis of the Femoral Heads = Perthe's Disease

### Cause

**Congenital:**

- **C**ongenital dislocation of hip

**Acquired:**
