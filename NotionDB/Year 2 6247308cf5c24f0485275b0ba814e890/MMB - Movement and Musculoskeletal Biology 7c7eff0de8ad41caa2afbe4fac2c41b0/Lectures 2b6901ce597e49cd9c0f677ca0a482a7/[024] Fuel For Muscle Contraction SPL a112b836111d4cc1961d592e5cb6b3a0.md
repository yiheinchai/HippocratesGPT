# [024] Fuel For Muscle Contraction SPL

# Introduction

- Type IIa have a high rate of CAC Activity and Type IIb (IIx) have a low rate of CAC Activity
- Muscle usually uses a mix of carbohydrate and fat, carbohydrate being the preferred fuel in the fed state and high intensity exercise.
- At rest, muscle mainly uses external sources of fuel and internal sources during exercise
- During exercise, [ATP] remains constant (despite being used up in muscle contraction) whilst [Creatine Phosphate] decreases significantly and [Creatine] increases. This is because PC is dephosphorylated to Creatine to phosphorylate ADP to form ATP.
- This is to maintain [ATP] so that the metabolic needs of the exercising muscle can be met

# Exercise

- During exercise, there is increased oxygen and glucose uptake due to increased blood flow (Oxygen and Glucose) and the translocation of GLUT4 Transporters to the sarcolemma during exercise (Glucose)
- As exercise intensity increases, lactate output drops by a small amount and then greatly increases
- At low intensity exercise, the increased Oxygen uptake decreases the amount of anaerobic metabolism required to produce ATP, causing lactate output to decrease.
- At higher intensities, O2 uptake is less than Gluciose uptake, meaning that Aerobic Metabolism ceases. This means that Glucose is metabolised anaerobically to provide ATP required for Metabolic processes, forming Lactate
- At rest, Lactate is produced by anaerobic respiration of plasma glucose (Resting Muscle is more dependent on external fuel sources and is less well-oxygenated), causing some lactate to be produced
- At low intensity exercise, lactate comes almost exclusively from plasma glucose, Which is completely catabolised aerobically, with little muscle glycogen being utilised, causing very little lactate to be produced
- At high intensity exercise, lactate comes from plasma glucose and muscle glycogen. The significant glucose uptake here with insufficient oxygen uptake means that there is a significant amount of anaerobic glucose metabolism, producing lots of lactate
- Glucose uptake reaches a maximum limit determined by the maximum rate at which GLUT4 can be mobilised to the sarcolemma and the maximum rate at which the liver can replenish/reform plasma glucose
- Muscle glycogen stores greatly decrease over the first hour of exercise however, plasma glucose cannot be used as a substitute for this muscle glycogen to maintain glucose availability
- Over a much longer period of time, muscle is still capable of increasing its uptake of Plasma FAs, with the usage of Plasma FAs increasing over time to make up for the decreasing muscle glycogen stores, to maintain ATP Production
- As exercise intensity increases, carbohydrate metabolism is favoured over fat metabolism
- Anaerobic metabolism is not limited by oxygen supply as NAD can be regenerated without the need for oxygen via the reduction of Pyruvate
- At high exercise intensities, Muscle Glycogen is the only fuel that can be metabolised quickly enough to meet ATP as anaerobic metabolism of glucose from Muscle Glycogen is not limited by oxygen availability
- Stores of Muscle Glycogen are limited and is reserved (to some extent) for higher intensity exercise but is still needed at lower intensities to completely meet ATP demands
- At low exercise intensities, aerobic metabolism of fat is sufficient to meet ATP Demands
- The body fat stores are usually present far in excess of what would be required during an exercise session and hence, do not need to be preserved and so can be metabolised at rest
- In the fed state, carbohydrate metabolism is favoured as Insulin release increased Carbohydrate uptake and metabolism and inhibits the release of FAs into the Plasma by adipose tissue
- In the fasting state, fat metabolism is favoured as decreased Insulin increases the release of FAs from Adipose tissue into the blood, which in turn inhibits Carbohydrate metabolism
- In untrained individuals, Carb metabolism would be relatively higher in both the fed and fasting states whilst fat metabolism would be lower
- This is as untrained muscle is not so well adapted to using fat as a fuel, hence explaining its lower endurance (Reduced Fat Metabolism means that Muscle Glycogen stores are depleted sooner, causing exhaustion)
- The difference in Carb metabolism before and after exercise between the Fast and Fed States in untrained individuals would also be smaller as untrained muscle is less metabolically flexible, responding to exercise in a similar manner in both fed and fasting states.
