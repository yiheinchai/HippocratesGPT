# Case 1

### Myasthenia Gravis

- Type II Hypersensitivity - Ab vs nAChRs at NMJ
- Fatiguability and Weakness. Better with rest and worse with Exercise
- Commonly occurs in Px with Autoimmune Hx (E.g Thyroid Disease)
- Sx:
1. Fatigable muscle weakness
- Typically worse at the end of the day or after exercise; symptoms better at rest
1. Ocular symptoms: diplopia and ptosis
2. Bulbar Sx - Slurred speech, difficulty chewing/swallowing
3. Respiratory muscle weakness: exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea (SOB when lying down)
4. Limb weakness – usually upper vs lower limbs & proximal muscles
- Common in younger women (2x more likely in younger women than men) and equally common in the both genders in elderly

### Receptors

- Nicotinic Receptors are always excitatory (M2 and M4 are Inhibitory whilst M1,3,5 are Excitatory)
- N1 Nicotinic Receptors are found in the NMJ where as N2 are found in the Brain and ANS

### Ix

1. Serum nAChR Ab
2. MuSK Ab
3. Serial Pulmonary Function Tests (Check Fatigability of Resp Muscles)
4. EMG and Nerve conduction Studies (Looking at NMJ Transmission)
5. Anterior Mediastinum CT/MRI (Check for Thymoma)
6. Edrophonium (Tensilon) Test (No Longer widely used) - Should produce improvement of Sx of MG after administration

### Drugs

- Anticholinesterases increase the duration of Neuromuscular Transmission
- If evidence of Life Threathening Signs with Bradycardia, First line = Adrenaline
- Side Effects of Cholinergic Stimulation

**D**iarrhoea
**U**rination

**M**iosis

**B**ronchospasm
**B**radycardia
**E**mesis (N&V)
**L**acrimation (Runny Eyes)
**L**ethargy

**S**alivation

- Side Effects of Anticholinergic = Can't Pee, Poo, See, Spit (AKA Secretions)
- Myasthenic Crisis = Worsening of Sx so that Respiratory Weakness increases and compromises breathing
