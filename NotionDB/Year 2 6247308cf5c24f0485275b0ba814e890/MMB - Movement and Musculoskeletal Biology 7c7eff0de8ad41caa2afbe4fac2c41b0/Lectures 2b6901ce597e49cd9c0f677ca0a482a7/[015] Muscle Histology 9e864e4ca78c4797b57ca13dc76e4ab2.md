# [015] Muscle Histology

# Organisation of Skeletal Muscle

- Skeletal Muscles contain 3 connective tissue sheets (Type 1 Collagen):
1. Endomysium - Surrounds each Muscle Fibre
2. Perimysium - Surrounds each Muscle Fascicle
3. Epimysium - Surrounds the entire muscle
- Muscle Cell = Muscle Fibre = Myocytes
- Myofibrils are arranged linearly and parallel to one another throughout the Muscle Fibre (Sarcomeric Organisation of the Myofibril), with transverse striations seen through the Myofibril of alternating staining (light and dark)
- Alternating Light and Dark Banding of Myofibrils makes Skeletal Muscles appear Striated Histologically, hence why Skeletal Muscle is often called Striated Muscle
- Sarcomere = Region between 2 Z Lines
- Actin and Myosin = Myofilaments

# Skeletal Muscle Cells

- Muscle Fibres are multinucleate, peripherally located, just deep to the Sarcolemma and superficial to Myofibrils (Main identifiable feature)
- Muscle Fibres are very long - up to 30 cm long

### Main Features

1. 1 Muscle Cell = 1 Muscle Fibre
2. Very Wide - 100μm diameter
3. Very Long - 30 cm
4. Multinucleate with Peripheral Nuclei
5. No Special Junctions between cells, connected purely via Connective Tissue Sheaths
6. Contain many mitochondria to provide ATP needed for contraction

# Skeletal Muscle Sections

- In TS, Individual Muscle Fibres appear as red-staining circles, bundled together within a Fascicle (Artefacts may be seen between Fibres), with peripheral nuclei being evident
- Not all Muscle Fibres in the TS will have a nuclei as the nuclei of a Muscle Fibre are distributed along its length and hence, may not be present at the level that the section is taken at
- The Perimysium surrounding the Fascicle stains dark pink and is highly cellular with lots of nuclei
- The Perimysium also contains lots of capillaries to supply nutrients and $O_2$  required for respiration to produce ATP for muscle contraction

# Myofibril

- As Actin Filaments do not touch each other within the Sarcomere, there is a region of the Sarcomere where only Myosin is found (H Zone - Stains lighter than other parts of A band which contain Actin and Myosin)
- I Band = Actin filaments only
- A Band = Actin and Myosin Filaments
- H Zone - Myosin Filaments only
- M Line is found within the H Zone and contains proteins that link Myosin filaments together like Myomesin.
- Z line contains proteins like α-actinin which link Actin filaments together

- Mitochondria are located along the Z Line of Myofibrils but not within the Sarcomeres themselves

# Sliding Theory of Contraction

- D**a**rk Band = **A** Band
- L**i**ght Band = **I** band
- During Muscle Contraction, the A Band stays the same width (as Myosin doesn't move) whereas the I Band Shortens (Contraction causes degree of Actin-Myosin Overlap to increase, decreasing the width of the region where only Actin is present)
- Whilst the I band shortens, the filaments themselves do not shorten.
- This shortening occurs due to the sliding of Actin Filaments over the myosin filaments
- When a muscle is contracted, the muscle appears less striated as the reduction in size of the Light I band causes the Dark A Bands to converge and come closer together (greater proportion of the muscle is made of dark/A bands)

# Sarcoplasmic Reticulum and T-Tubules

- Many proteins that link actin and myosin fibres together are dependent on $Ca^{2+}$ to trigger muscle contraction
- Sarcoplasmic Reticulum is arranged around the outside of Myofibrils and Nuclei are peripherally located so they do not disturb the parallel organisation of the myofibrils, which would in turn reduce force generation and muscle shortening during contraction
- $Ca^{2+}$ influx is triggered by the arrival of an AP from Motor Neurons that terminate on muscle fibres.
- This AP spreads across the Sarcolemma, through pores which enter T-Tubules, triggering $Ca^{2+}$ release from the SR as the AP spreads from the T-Tubule into the SR at the Triad.
- T-Tubules are linked to the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum via the Triad (T Tubule located between 2 strands of SR) and allow for ions to spread inside the muscle fibre

# Muscle Fibre Types

### Type I - Slow Twitch

- 'Red' and Small
- Related to continuous weak contraction (E.g Postural Muscles)
- Rich in Myoglobin to store $O_2$ required for Aerobic Processes (Making them dark red), primarily producing ATP via Aerobic Processes

### Type II - Fast Twitch

- 'White' and Large
- Related to intense, sporadic and rapid contraction (E.g Biceps)
- Rich in Glycogen (Making them White), primarily producing ATP via Anaerobic Processes (Glycolysis)
- Most Muscles are formed from a mix of these two types of fibres
- Under H&E, Type I Fibres appear Dark Red and are small diameter whereas Type II Fibres appear Orangey-Yellow and are large diameter

# Motor Units

- Motor Neurons of the Spinal Cord have their cell bodies located in the Ventral Horns (Ventral Root Ganglia)
- NMJ looks like a bunch of grapes
- Each Muscle Fibre is only innervated by a single motor unit/neuron

![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 18.19.32.png](%5B015%5D%20Muscle%20Histology%209e864e4ca78c4797b57ca13dc76e4ab2/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_18.19.32.png)

- Collections of NMJs = Motor End Plate
- Muscle Spindles are found at the end of Muscle Fibres stain lighter than Muscle Fibres, lack striations and are oval-shaped
- When the motor neuron is activated, it becomes activated via sensory neuron input via Afferents which release Glutamate which stimulates the motor neuron

![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 18.46.33.png](%5B015%5D%20Muscle%20Histology%209e864e4ca78c4797b57ca13dc76e4ab2/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_18.46.33.png)

# Neuromuscular Junction

- NMJ contains many ACh-Vesicles
- The Sarcolemmal Membrane that is involved in the NMJ is highly folded
- Stimulation of an AP within the Sarcolemma propagates down a T-Tubule and into the SR, triggering $Ca^{2+}$ release

![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 18.51.12.png](%5B015%5D%20Muscle%20Histology%209e864e4ca78c4797b57ca13dc76e4ab2/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_18.51.12.png)

# Muscle Spindles and Golgi Tendon Organs

### Muscle Spindle

- 1a afferents wrap their axons around the Muscle Spindle/Intrafusal Fibres

![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 18.53.34.png](%5B015%5D%20Muscle%20Histology%209e864e4ca78c4797b57ca13dc76e4ab2/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_18.53.34.png)

### Golgi Tendon Organ

- Rather hard to see Histologically but can be seen in some tendon cross-sections

![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 18.55.24.png](%5B015%5D%20Muscle%20Histology%209e864e4ca78c4797b57ca13dc76e4ab2/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_18.55.24.png)

# Myasthenia Gravis

- MG is associated with autoimmune antibodies against nAChRs, blocking the ability of ACh to bind to these receptors, reducing the ability of the muscle to contract following nervous stimulation
- This leads to a reduced number of nAChRs (Stippling), flattened and more simple postsynaptic junctional folds and a widened synaptic space
- It has no cure but it can be treated with Ab vs AChE (Acetylcholinesterase) or immunosuppression
- This increases [ACh] in the Synapse, allowing ACh to remain in the NMJ, allowing longer lasting nAChR stimulation in an attempt to restore normal muscle responses to ACh
- To avoid long lasting muscle contraction following the release of ACh from Motor Neurons, the NMJ expresses AChE (Anticholinesterase) to degrade ACh to prevent continual nAChR stimulation and thus, muscle contraction
- AChE is expressed within the Junctional Folds of AChE

# Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

- Associated with Muscle Wasting
- Caused by the Absence of Dystrophin
- Dystrophin is a large Sarcolemmal protein that is involved in linking the Actin Cytoskeleton to the Sarcolemma, which is in turn linked to Collagen Fibres in the Basal Lamina via Laminin
- Dystrophin Absence from the Sarcolemma causes leads to dysregulation between the Actin Cytoskeleton and the Sarcolemma
- It causes abnormal $Ca^{2+}$ entry into cells, leading to overactivity of the muscle fibre, leading to cell death
- It is an X-Linked Recessive Disorder
- Rx for DMD are associated with trying to restore functional Dystrophin expression in the Sarcolemma or allowing the Muscle to repair itself following cell death via the formation of new Muscle Fibres

![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 19.10.55.png](%5B015%5D%20Muscle%20Histology%209e864e4ca78c4797b57ca13dc76e4ab2/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_19.10.55.png)

- Histologically, DMD is characterised by an absence of Dystrophin when a Skeletal Muscle Specimen is visualised under Immunofluorescence specific for Dystrophin
- Normally, Dystrophin is found within the Sarcolemma of the Muscle Fibre

![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 19.17.46.png](%5B015%5D%20Muscle%20Histology%209e864e4ca78c4797b57ca13dc76e4ab2/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_19.17.46.png)

# Satellite Cells

- These are muscle stem cells which can be used to Rx DMD
- Normally, if a muscle fibre has been damaged, Satellite Cells are activated and go to repair the Muscle Fibre
- They are present in Adult Muscles but usually few in number and in a dormant state, activated when damage occurs

![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 19.23.33.png](%5B015%5D%20Muscle%20Histology%209e864e4ca78c4797b57ca13dc76e4ab2/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_19.23.33.png)

- Satellite Cells are found closely associated to Muscle Fibres
- They are uninucleate, with a large nucleus that occupies most of the space of the cell

# Experimental Therapies for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

1. Drug Therapy (Anti-Myostatin, NO)
2. Mutation Specific Strategies:
- Exon-Skipping (AON-Mediated)
- Nonsense Codon Suppression (Ataluren)
1. Gene Therapy/Editing - Attempts to readd the functional Dystrophin gene to Muscle Fibres so that Normal Dystrophin expression returns
- Mini/Micro-Dystrophins via AAVs/Adeno-Associated Viruses
- Human Artificial Cromosomes - Can be added to Muscle Cells in Px with DMD to add a functional Dystrophin gene to these cells to restore normal expression
- CRISPRs via AAVs/Adeno-Associated Viruses

![Screenshot 2021-10-03 at 19.52.02.png](%5B015%5D%20Muscle%20Histology%209e864e4ca78c4797b57ca13dc76e4ab2/Screenshot_2021-10-03_at_19.52.02.png)

1. Stem Cell Therapy - Generate new muscle fibres to replace muscle fibres that have died due to DMD
- Satellite Cell-Derived Myoblasts (Local Administration)
- Pericyte-Derived Mesoangioblasts (Systemic Delivery)
- So far, these have been limited to allogenic Tx (from another person)
- In the future, hopefully iPSC-Derived Myogenic Cells will be useful
