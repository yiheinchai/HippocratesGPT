# [037] Bone and Bone Disease

# Bone Remodelling/Turnover

- Osteoclasts are required (resorption of bone). Without them, the bone marrow cavity would become very small and compressed and bone would become extremely heavy.
- OCs in the bone marrow continuously resorb and enlarge the marrow cavity as OBs synthesise more bone on the Periosteal Surface to produce shape changes to the bone whilst ensuring it is not too heavy
- There needs to be a balance between bone formation and resorption:
- Formation > Resorption = Bone Growth (notably in early life)
- Formation = Resportion = Steady State (Adult 20-45 year)
- Formation < Resorption = Bone Loss (osteopenia/osteoporosis - Notably in later life)

- If a Px is Ca²⁺ deficient, with low Ca²⁺ in the diet, Ca²⁺ stored in bones will be liberated via resorption of bone by OCs in order to maintain Constant [Ca²⁺]
- After Menopause in women (>50), OCs become hyperactive, producing larger cavities in Trabecular Bone that OBs are unable to fill rapidly enough, causing perforation of the Trabecular Elements
- This happens locally post-menopause due to the loss of Oestrogen, which is involved in suppressing the development and activity of OCs
- This degradation of trabecular bone happens rapidly due to the high turnover rate of trabecular bone (due to its large SA) but also as OC Bone Resorption > OB Bone Formation

# Bone Cell Regulation

## Calcium Regulating Hormones

### Parathyroid Hormone (PTH)

- Critical regulator of plasma Ca²⁺ level.
- It is Rapidly acting and produces short duration effects (provides minute-to-minute regulation) as it is a peptide hormone
- ↑ plasma Ca²⁺ (critical regulator):
- ↑ OC recruitment and activity.
- ↑ OB proliferation and activity.
- PTH, therefore ↑ bone turnover due to increased OB and OC activity
- At low doses, it is anabolic (Greater effect on OB activity than OC activity, causing bone growth) but at higher doses, it is catabolic (OC Activity > OB Activity, causing bone loss)

### 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D

- Sunlight acts on 7-Dehydrocholesterol in the skin to form Vitamin D₃ (Cholecalciferol) which travels round in the blood.
- In the liver, Vit D₃ is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol/25-OH Vit D₃
- In Kidney, 25-OH Vit D₃ is further hydroxylated to 1,25 Dihydroxycholecalciferol/1,25(OH)₂ Vit D₃ where the compound becomes biologically active
- ↑ Gut uptake of Ca²⁺ and hence, plasma Ca²⁺
- ↑ OC recruitment and activity but ↓ OB proliferation, although it does ↑ OB and other skin cell differentiation
- It is required for normal matrix mineralisation.
- Deficiency results in osteomalacia (adults), rickets (children).
- It is slower acting but its effects last longer as it is a steroid hormone

![Screenshot 2021-10-08 at 17.38.19.png](%5B037%5D%20Bone%20and%20Bone%20Disease%20f2fd389ca1c44a438e21796e0ac711ae/Screenshot_2021-10-08_at_17.38.19.png)

### Calcitonin

- ↓ Plasma Ca²⁺ in young/hypercalcaemic Px (Due to high bone turnover).
- ↓ OC recruitment and activity, reducing the quantity of Ca²⁺ liberated from the bone during bone turnover
- It has very little effect in normal adults as few OCs are present in the bone (due to their ability to rapidly degrade bone).
- Calcitonin becomes more effective as an 'emergency hormone' in pathologies mediated by OC Hyperactivity (Osteoporosis etc.)

## Bone Cell Regulation

### Glucocorticoids

- Example: cortisol, cortisone
- Necessary for normal bone development/function
- In excess, causes bone loss/osteoporosis (most common cause of Iatrogenic Bone Loss)

### Growth Hormone

- Required for normal bone growth

### Sex Steroids

- Example: oestrogens and androgens
- Exert critical long term (slow acting) beneficial effects on bone maintenance
- ↓ OC recruitment and activity and possibly ↑ OB Activity
- ↑ blood supply to bone
- Deficiency → ↑ bone turnover and osteoporosis in Post-Menopausal women and elderly men due to decline in circulating sex hormones

## Local Factors Involved in Bone Cell Regulation

### Prostaglandins

- They are normal products of OBs
- ↑ and ↓ OC activity depending on the specific Prostaglandin
- Mediate some actions of growth factors and cytokines and responses to mechanical stimuli (specific role is unknown)

### Growth Factors

- Mitogens (Example: TGF-𝛽, BMP, IGF I and II, PDGF, FGF)
- Normal OB products deposited in bone matrix, often in large amounts
- May mediate some hormone reactions

### WNT Proteins

- Cysteine-rich glycoprotein signalling molecules
- Molecular Weight = 40 kDa
- ↑ OB differentiation
- Blocked by sclerostin (glycoprotein produced by osteocyte. It has an anti-anabolic effect on bone formation)
- Lack of Wnt will produce cartilage instead of bone due to lack of OB Differentiation/formation

### Cytokines

- Normal products of immune cells and bone cells
- Example: IL 1,2,3,4,6,10,11,13,17,18, TNF, RANK ligand (the major factor required for OC formation), colony stimulating factor (especially M-CSF, which drives differentiation of osteoclast precursor)
- IL-6 is important for Osteoclast formation
- ↑ OC recruitment, activity etc. andhence, can cause bone loss
- Some interleukins may mediate PTH, 1,25(OH)₂D₃ actions
- Sex steroids may inhibit production of some interleukins

### Inorganic Agents

1. H⁺ (low pH, acidity):
- ↑↑↑ OC activity
- ↓↓↓ mineralisation (by dissolving hydroxyapatite)
1. Hypoxia (low oxygen tension):
- ↑↑↑ OC recruitment (in presence of RANK Ligand)
- This is likely the case due to the Myeloid/WBC origin of OCs as Hypoxia stimulates HSC differentiation into RBCs (and likely into OCs too)
- ↓↓↓ bone formation
1. Phosphate:
- ↓ OC recruitment, activity
1. Calcium:
- ↓ OC recruitment, activity (small effect)
1. Fluoride:
- ↑ bone formation (but bone is low quality)

### Mechanical Loading

- Repetitive exposure to a mechanical load, bone becomes bigger and heavier - Very important
- Notably impact loading - Sudden addition of a heavy load to a bone (jolts, impacts etc)

# Ca²⁺ Regulation

- Almost all Ca²⁺ in both (> 99%) exists as mineral deposits in skeleton and teeth
- In man, plasma Ca²⁺ is tightly maintained at around 2.5 mM.
- Local concentrations of Ca²⁺ in extracellular fluid may vary more due to Ca²⁺ role in intracellular signalling and muscle contraction.
- About 50% of plasma Ca²⁺ is ionised and diffusible and the other 50% is protein-bound.

Ca²⁺ regulation must be precise as:

- Ca²⁺ is used as a vital second messenger within cells.
- Ca²⁺ is necessary for normal blood coagulation, muscle
contraction and nerve function.
- Hypocalcaemia results in excitation of nerve and muscle cells leading to spasms, tetany and asphyxia
- Solubility of many Ca²⁺ salts (phosphate, carbonate, sulphate,
oxalate) is low.
- ↑ in Ca²⁺ could lead to inappropriate precipitation of these insoluble salts in tissues (tissue mineralisation)

---

# PO₄³⁻ Regulation

- Plasma PO₄³⁻ is less tightly regulated than Ca²⁺ (normal range is 0.8-1.5 mM in adult humans)
- FGF23 is a key circulating PO₄³⁻ lowering hormone:
1. ↓ PO₄³⁻ reabsorption in proximal renal tubules
2. ↓ PO₄³⁻absorption from intestine
- ↑ PO₄³⁻(hyperphosphataemia) is toxic and associated with accelerated ageing

---

# Regulatory Factors Produced by Osteocytes

- Osteocytes have important endocrine/paracrine role in regulating bone and mineral metabolism
- Main source of at least 3 key regulators of bone and mineral metabolism:
1. FGF23: ↓ blood phosphate
2. Sclerostin: ↓ bone formation by blocking WNT proteins
3. RANK ligand: ↑ OC formation

---

# Osteoclast Formation Requires M-CSF and RANK Ligand

- Osteoclasts differentiate from Progenitors in the Myeloid Pathway
- M-CSF causes Myeloid Progenitor to differentiate into Monocyte Progenitor
- RANK Ligand causes Monocyte Progenitors to differentiate and fuse together to form Osteoclasts
- M-CSF: Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor
- RANK ligand: Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor 𝜅-B ligand

# Osteoporosis

- Loss of bone and deterioration of microarchitecture, leading to ↑ risk of fracture with minimal trauma
- Trabecular Bone appears much more porous (fewer, but larger pores) due to the complete destruction of some trabecular elements and partial destruction of others, with remaining elements being extremely thin and fragile
- Surfaces of the trabecular elements have a 'moth-eaten' irregular appearance on its surface due to the overlap of Resorption pits formed by hyperactive OCs
- The complete destruction of trabecular elements in Osteoporosis means that there is no longer a bony template upon which OBs can deposit bone, preventing the formation of new trabecular elements, causing the enlarged pores formed by OC Hyperactivity to remain permanent

![Screenshot (11).png](%5B037%5D%20Bone%20and%20Bone%20Disease%20f2fd389ca1c44a438e21796e0ac711ae/Screenshot_(11).png)

![Screenshot (12).png](%5B037%5D%20Bone%20and%20Bone%20Disease%20f2fd389ca1c44a438e21796e0ac711ae/Screenshot_(12).png)

- When this occurs in the Vertebral Column, causing Vertebral Collapse, this produces a Characteristic Dowager's Hump (Located in the Lower Neck/Upper Back), causing the chin to move closer to the chest

![img_5bf440f2885c9-1.png](%5B037%5D%20Bone%20and%20Bone%20Disease%20f2fd389ca1c44a438e21796e0ac711ae/img_5bf440f2885c9-1.png)

- WHO definition: bone mass < 2.5 SDs below average peak, measured by DEXA
- Osteopenia: defined as bone mass < 1 SD

### Risk Factor

- Most common disorder of the bone
- Menopause/oophorectomy (i.e. oestrogen deficiency)
- Old age
- Hypothalamic amenorrhea (e.g. due to excessive exercise) (menstruation stops)
- Hypogonadism in males
- Genetic (white Europeans), +ve family history
- Small build/low body weight
- Sedentary lifestyle (moderate weight-bearing exercise is beneficial in maintaining bone mass)
- Smoking (very strong, likely due to vascular effects of smoking), alcohol abuse (> 25-30 units/week), excessive caffeine (the latter 2 are not that significant)
- Drugs (e.g. corticosteroids, heparin) - Corticosteroids usage is the most common cause of Iatrogenic Osteoporosis
- Chronic low-level acidosis (E.g due to low level renal disease)
- Chronic respiratory disease (COPD), anaemias - Commonly lead to Hypoxia, leading to OC Formation and Activation
- Transplants, AIDS

### Screening

- Normal X-ray: not very sensitive. Only detects severe osteoporosis
- DEXA (dual X-ray absorptiometry): Gold standard. Sensitive, quantitative, very low radiation dose.
- Drawback = Equipment iss expensive.
- CAT (computer aided tomography): high-resolution 3D X-ray images. High radiation dose, expensive so not commonly used for Osteoporosis screening
- Bone biopsy: laborious quantitative histology of iliac crest samples (not really done anymore).
- Drawback = Iliac Crest is a relatively unloaded bone and hence, may not be very representative of wider skeleton
- Ultrasound: measures quality and density together. Quite cheap but not very reliable
- Biochemical markers: e.g. urinary collagen cross-links (also found in Circulation). Provide a good index of bone collagen resorption and other markers can be used to observe bone formation
- FRAX: low-cost, computer-based risk assessment.
- It uses an algorithm based on large-scape Px Cohort data
- It identifies a 10 yr fracture risk using input of Med Hx, Family Hx, Lifestyle factors etc.
- Drawback - FRAX utilises 'Black Box Algorithm' where risk factors used in Screening of Osteoporosis are unknown, so its accuracy is relatively unclear

### DEXA Scanning

- Drawback = Only Gives 'Area; Density' data (units = g/cm²) AKA The mass of mineral that is present under a given area of bone NOT in a given volume of bone
- As true density (g/cm³) is not being measured, DEXA does not tell you anything about the depth and volume of the bone
- It does not give good information on bone quality (e.g Trabecular Connectivity/Integrity of Trabecular elements)
- It is not a great predictor of fracture risk

# Treatment/Prevention of Osteoporosis

## Anti-Resorptive - Inhibit OC

### HRT - Hormone Replacement Therapy:

- Replacement of lost oestrogens (+ progestins) during menopause
- It is quite cheap
- Androgens: oral, transdermal, implants (lots of administration routes)
- Less frequently used due to concerns regarding increased risk of some cancers and cardiovascular events
- It is not an extremely potent OC blocker so it allows for some slower bone turnover to still occur

### SERMs (Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulators)

- Example: Tamoxifen, Raloxifene
- These are partial antagonists at the Oestrogen receptors
- They inhibit bone resorption by OCs but can be toxic so are not front-line

### Calcitonin:

- Would need to be injected daily as it is a peptide hormone (short duration of activity)
- Expensive
- It has limited effectiveness and has some significant side-effects so is not used

### Calcium:

- Limited effectiveness (best in elderly)
- Cheap
- Oral administration via tablet
- It is associated with a slight increase in adverse cardiovascular events

### Strontium Ranelate:

- Effective in ↓ fracture incidence
- It also shows increased risk adverse cardiovascular effects

### Bisphosphonates:

- E.g Alen**dronate**, Risedronate, Zoledronate
- Effective and Cheap
- Main concern with their usage is their potency on blocking OC Activity/Bone Resorption
- Many of these drugs can be taken oral (Alendronate and Risedronate) but Zoledronate (Most Potent - Must be injected 1x a year)
- Analogues of pyrophosphate (Central O replaced with R'-C-R'' which modify specific properties of the drug)

![Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 15.22.32.png](%5B037%5D%20Bone%20and%20Bone%20Disease%20f2fd389ca1c44a438e21796e0ac711ae/Screenshot_2021-10-09_at_15.22.32.png)

- Direct effect on OC by preventing them adhering to bone surface by binding to the bone mineral on the Periosteal Surface.
- OCs endocytose Bisphosphonate in attempts to resorb bone, causing the OC to die/become inactivated so that bone is not resorbed

### Zoledronate

- Highly potent (causes localised toxicity and so also used in Chemotherapy, notably regarding bone cancers)
- Annual infusion (3-5 mg).
- It completely stops bone resorption and bone formation (might be toxic to OB or as a consequent of OC toxicity).
- Lodges permanently in bone and has long-term effects as it is not metabolised so must be administered with caution.
- Blockade of Bone Turnover by Zoledronate can lead to the gradual secondary mineralisation of Trabecular Bone, increasing the brittleness of bone and hence, contributing to increased fracture risk (Concern also applies to mAb against RANK Ligand)
- Osteonecrosis of jaw and abnormal femoral fractures have been reported as side-effects, notably in Px with Cancer who are getting large Zoledronate doses
- Femoral fractures possibly occur due to inhibition of bone turnover, meaning old, weakened bone accumulates
- Adverse effects are rare in non-cancer Pxs who receive smaller doses

![Screenshot 2021-10-10 at 21.39.34.png](%5B037%5D%20Bone%20and%20Bone%20Disease%20f2fd389ca1c44a438e21796e0ac711ae/Screenshot_2021-10-10_at_21.39.34.png)

### Monoclonal antibody against RANK ligand:

- Example: Denosumab/Prolia
- Prevent formation of OC, which prevents resorption and formation (turnover).
- Expensive
- mAb persist in Circulation for only 6 months and so, there is rapid reversal of their protective effects 6 months after last dose.
- Without tight management of administration to ensure that mAb are present in high enough numbers in the circulation, OC return and are more active than previously, causing more intense bone loss
- There is discussion about the use of Denosumab and a Bisphosphonate to permanently inactive OCs

### Cathepsin K Inhibitor:

- Phase 3 trial completed but is not yet approved due to serious side effects noted in trials

---

# Anabolic Treatments

## Anabolic - Stimulate OB Activity

### PTH

- Anabolic for bone in low, intermittent doses
- Expensive injections given 3-5x a week

### Abaloparatide (PTH-rP 1-34 Analogue)

- More effective than PTH
- Must be injected daily
- It is very expensive but has been approved

### Monoclonal Antibody against Sclerostin

- E.g Romososumab
- Shown big increases in bone formation (extremely effective)
- Shown to be anti-resorptive (Inhibits OC Activity)
- It does not appear to cause undesired bone growth despite reduced WNT inhibition
- Only have to be injected a few times a year
- It is quite expensive

---

# Bone Mass and Fracture Probability

- Peaks during 30s, remains stable for around 15 yrs before declining  gradually for men
- In women, after the peak, there is a significant post-menopausal drop in bone mass, followed by a gradual decline in bone mass
- At all ages, bone mass is lower in women than in men

![Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 15.24.38.png](%5B037%5D%20Bone%20and%20Bone%20Disease%20f2fd389ca1c44a438e21796e0ac711ae/Screenshot_2021-10-09_at_15.24.38.png)

- Increases in hip fracture probability occur significantly >65
- Incidence is much greater in women than men

![Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 15.25.03.png](%5B037%5D%20Bone%20and%20Bone%20Disease%20f2fd389ca1c44a438e21796e0ac711ae/Screenshot_2021-10-09_at_15.25.03.png)

- In Elderly men (>85), there is a rapid increase in the incidence of Hip (high mortality associated due to blood loss) and Spinal Fractures
- For women, increase in forearm fractures post-menopause.
- Post-Menopause also marks a significant increase in Spinal and Hip Fractures (Before this rise is seen in men)

![Screenshot 2021-10-09 at 15.25.14.png](%5B037%5D%20Bone%20and%20Bone%20Disease%20f2fd389ca1c44a438e21796e0ac711ae/Screenshot_2021-10-09_at_15.25.14.png)

# Sclerostin and Sclerosteosis

### Sclerostin

- Natural inhibitor of Wnt signalling in bone
- Sclerostin Knock Out in mice have ↑ bone (increased density and quantity of Trabecular and Cortical Bone).
- Trabecular bone formation rate 9-fold greater in KOs
- Monoclonal antibodies against sclerostin also cause major bone growth

### Sclerosteosis

- Rare autosomal recessive loss of function mutation in SOST (sclerostin gene) leading to bone overgrowth.
- Best documented in Afrikaner families in South Africa
- Van Buchem disease: autosomal recessive high bone mass condition associated with deletion of SOST enhancer element, leading to bone overgrowth and head deformities
- Progressive overgrowth of bone due to unregulated action of Wnt proteins means that Neurovascular Channels start to become occluded, compromising perfusion and innervation to bone
- This means Px require repetitive surgeries to prevent this from occurring

---

# Osteopetrosis

- These diseases are due to OC Deficiency
- This causes:
1. Impaired modelling and remodelling of bones
2. Growth defects (bones too thick and heavy)
3. 'Marble Bone Syndrome' - Failure of Bone Eruption (Alveolar Bone of Jaw is not dissolved away, preventing migration of Adult Tooth Superficially to erupt out of gum)
- Severe forms are lethal
- One form of Osteopetrosis is due to the naturally-occurring disruption of Carbonic Anhydrase II gene - This means that OC can't generate Carbonic Acid and hence, protons and hence, cannot resorb bone
- Naturally occurring mutations and knockout experiments in mice prove that M-CSF and RANK Ligand are essential for Osteoclast Development, with the Knockout of these genes producing Osteopetrotic Mice (lack of OCs)

---

# Cancer and Bone

- Osteosarcoma: osteoblast tumour that is Frequently aggressive.
- Most common in younger individuals
- If caught early, usually Rx via Amputation of limb proximal to cancer
- Osteoclastoma: Tumour caused by cancerous growth of Osteoclasts at the end of the bone, which destroy the surrounding bone
- It does not metastasise.
- Not life-threatening but causes rapid local destruction of bone via OC Hyperactivity
- Many cancers have a propensity to metastasise to bone (breast, lung, kidney, prostate, multiple myeloma - most commonly known)
- Tumour cells produce osteoclast stimulating factors (TNF, interleukins, RANK Ligand)
- Poor Vascularity of tumour means that there is often low O₂ and low pH in tumour, both of which stimulate OC strongly, leading to:
1. ↑ formation and activity of OC surrounding tumours (↑ resorption)
2. ↑ release of growth factors stored within bone matrix that can stimulate tumour growth
- This establishes a positive feedback look where Tumour Cells stimulate OCs, which digest Bone Matrix, freeing growth factors which further stimulate the growth and activity of Tumour Cells (Vicious Cycle Hypothesis)
1. ↑ bone resorption due to OC Hyperactivity → fractures and Hypercalcaemia

---

# Paget's Disease

- Bizarre local remodelling disorder
- Characterised by very large overactive osteoclasts
- Contributory causes: infection with paromyxovirus like canine distemper virus or measles or Genetic Lysosome disorders
- Overactive OCs cause accelerated bone resorption at certain focal sites
- Bone formation by osteoblasts ↑ to attempt to rectify the excessive bone resorption but new bone formed is disorganised.
- This can sometimes trigger osteosarcoma development
- Leads to painful deformities that are frequently hot to touch

### Treatment:

1.  Bisphosphonates (or calcitonin, less frequently used)
2. Resorption inhibitors
- Strange geographical distribution.
- Almost unknown in many countries but is most common in North West England AKA Lancastershire (5% of over 50s) - Indicates underlying genetic issue
- Common in countries where British individuals have emigrated to (E.g New Zealand)

---

# Osteogenesis Imperfecta

- Brittle bone disease →
- Diverse family of genetic disorders
- Due to mutations of 𝛼1 and 𝛼2 chains of type I collagen
- Severity varies greatly, depending on mutation type, ranging from:
1. Minimal deformity, sometimes with hearing loss or blue sclera
2. Deformity
3. Impaired stature/tooth development
4. Prenatal lethality

---

# Metabolic Acidosis

- Results from net addition of H⁺ to blood, causing ↓ HCO₃⁻ and ↓ pH
- Chronic metabolic acidosis is usually the result of kidney disease (Impaired H⁺ Secretion)
- Causes bone loss by turning on resorption in 2 main ways:
1. Diseased kidney loses ability to form 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D:
- ↓ Ca²⁺ uptake from gut → ↓ plasma Ca²⁺ → ↑ PTH secretion to try and maintain [Ca²⁺] → ↑ OC formation and activity
1. OC directly responsive to extracellular H⁺:
- Small ↓ pH → ↑↑ resorption pit formation.
- This could be as resorbing bone leads to the release of alkaline bone mineral (hydroxyapatite) as a final emergency mechanism to correct systemic acidosis
