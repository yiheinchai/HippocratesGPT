# Skeletal Muscle Function

- When maximum muscle tension is achieved, ATP is required to maintain that level of tension
- Tetanus = Muscle does not have time to relax between successive stimuli so muscle twitches summate, producing a smooth prolonged contraction that is many times stronger than a single twitch
- Minimum unit of contraction caused by a single action potential = Twitch (Contraction of 1 muscle fibre)

# Contraction

- Isotonic - When sufficient tension has been generated to move the load, tension remains relatively constant during movement
- The threshold current for the stimulation of a twitch is around 4-6 mA and maximal stimulus to produce maximum contraction (100% of recruitable fibres are contracting) is usually 12-15 mA
- As the stimulus interval between stimuli decreases, there is increased summation of tension (muscle twitches overlap and merge) generated with each contraction, causing the contraction force of the muscle to increase.
- This is because the muscle continues to shorten to a greater extent as each contraction adds to the one produced previously
- Summation begins to occur when stimulus interval < recovery/relaxation time

- As the distance between the start of the nerve and the muscle it innervates increases, there is a greater latency period regarding nervous conduction as the stimulation has further to travel
- Latency = Time from stimulation of nerve to the start of muscle contraction
- Nerve Conduction is usually at least 50 m/s and can be much greater in large nerves
