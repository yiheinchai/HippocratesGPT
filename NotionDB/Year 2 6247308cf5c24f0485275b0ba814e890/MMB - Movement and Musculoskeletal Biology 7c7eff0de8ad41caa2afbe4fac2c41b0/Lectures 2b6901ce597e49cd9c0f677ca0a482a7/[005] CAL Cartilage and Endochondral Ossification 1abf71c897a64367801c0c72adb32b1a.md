# [005] CAL : Cartilage and Endochondral Ossification

# Hyaline Cartilage (Fetal Rib)

- Hyaline Cartilage appears amorphous and light, surrounded by a darkly stained fibrous perichondrium- Replaced by bone via Endochondral Ossification
- Towards the deep aspect of the rib, muscle can be found, separated by collaginous septa (Type I Collagen)

- Growing hyaline cartilage is densely cellular (lots of chondrocyte nuclei present make the amorphous cartilage appear speckled)
- As Chondrocytes are not fully matured in the fetal bone, they are populated throughout the entire cartilage vs localised to small, densely packed groups (as is seen in adult cartilage)
- Just surrounding the amorphous hyaline cartilage lies the Chondrogenic Layer of the Perichondrium, containing Chondroblasts which migrate into the Cartilage during development to expand the cartilage via Appositional Growth
- Surrounding the Chondrogenic Layer of the Perichondrium is the Fibrous Perichondrium, made of Type I Collagen
- Surrounding the Cartilage and Perichondrium is well-vascularised muscle (Muscle with lots of embedded blood vessels, arranged in multiple directions) with some adipose tissue

# Articular Cartilage (Mature Knee)

- The bone on the Left is the Femur, Right is the Tibia, Above the Femur is the Patella
- Overlying the Patella and Tibia is the Patellar Ligament and running obliquely to connect the Tibia and Femur are the Cruciate Ligaments
- The Spaces above and below these Ligaments is filled with Synovial Tissue

![Matknee01.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Matknee01.jpg)

- On the outer surfaces of the bone, there is a smooth layer of Articular Cartilage. which appears, lighter, more pink and more amorphous than the underlying Subchondral Bone.
- Just under the Articular Cartilage is Subchondral Bone, which is thicker and has fewer marrow spaces than regular bone
- Within the Marrow Spaces of Adult Bone, Adipocytes, Haematopoetic Tissue and a few Sinusoids can be found (mainly Adipocytes)
- Adipocytes can be distinguished from marrow spaces as the outlines of the Adipocyte Membranes can be visible in collections of Adipocytes vs Marrow Cavities which are a single cavity (Adipocytes may appear like a 'bunch of bubbles' whereas the Bone Cavities are single cavities)
- Haematopoetic Tissue can also be found within bone marrow (stains dark purple)

![Matknee02.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Matknee02.jpg)

- Articular Surfaces of the Cartilage are completely smooth with no folds or irregularities normally
- Bone stains a very dark red colour, and contains vascular channels, which run towards but do not pierce the Mineralised Articular Cartilage (Cartilage produces factors that prevents growing blood vessels from invading it)

![Matknee03.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Matknee03.jpg)

- There is no fibrous perichondrium on articular cartilage to ensure that the articulating surfaces are kept smooth and frictionless to minimise joint damage
- The tidemark zone can be seen as a wavy line between the Soft Unmineralised Cartilage (Chondrocyte Nuclei are easily visible and arranged regularly in columns) and the Harder Mineralised Cartilage (Chondrocyte Nuclei are poorly distinguished and relatively irregularly arranged in columns)
- Unmineralised Cartilage stains a bright pink, Mineralised Cartilage stains a pinky-red (between the colour of bone and unmineralised cartilage) and bone stains a bright red
- Mineralised Cartilage = Unmineralised Cartilage + Hydroxyapatite (Calcium Phosphate)
- Mineralised Cartilage is interdigitated in and is embedded in the underlying bone, securely binding the Mineralised Cartilage to the Bone
- Unmineralised Articular Cartilage → Mineralised Articular Cartilage → Bone
- Nuclei in Bone = Osteocytes
- Osteocytes are connected to one another via fine projections/canaliculi whilst each group of Chondrocytes are not connected
- Tidemark Zone advances throughout life towards the Articular Surface, reducing the amount of Unmineralised Cartilage present as the individual ages
- Chondrocytes in mature cartilage when arranged in small clusters reflects limited interstitial proliferation of cartilage occurring

# Growing Bone (Immature Knee - Growth Plate)

- Immature bone are not filled with Adipocytes as they are still growing. Instead, they are highly cellular, filled with Haematopoietic Tissue

![Immatknee01.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Immatknee01.jpg)

- Growth Plate can be seen as a curved layer of cartilage spanning the width of the bone, either side of the highly vascularised bone
- Either side of the Epiphyseal Growth Plate, the Secondary Ossification Centre (Smaller than Primary Centre and rounded, found towards the tip of the bone) and the Primary Ossification Centre (Larger and relatively cylindrical in shape, spanning most of the shaft of the bone) are found
- Primary Ossification Centre is needed for the elongation of the bone and Secondary Ossification Centre is needed for the formation of the tips of the bone and any condyles/tubercles found here
- Marrow of Primary Ossification Centre = Diaphyseal Marrow Cavity
- Surrounding the Secondary Ossification Centre is a curved Radial Growth Plate, also cartilaginous but less organised than the Primary Growth Plate
- Trabecular Bone appears orangy-brown and as fine strands, surrounded by very darkly staining Haematopoetic Tissue

![Immatknee02.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Immatknee02.jpg)

![Immatknee03.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Immatknee03.jpg)

- There are 3 Cartilage Zones in the Growth Plate, Zone of Reserve/Resting Cartilage, Proliferation and Hypertrophy and Calcification, moving from the Secondary to the Primary Ossification Centre
- The segment of the Growth Plate closest to the Secondary Ossification Centre is Resting/Reserved Cartilage, containing Chondroblasts which become activated
- The Chondroblasts here are irregularly arranged and quite sparce, causing this region to appear much smooth/more amorphous than the Proliferation Zone
- Upon Activation, Chondroblasts migrate towards the Primary Ossification Centre, dividing and stacking upon one another to form Columns between the Two Ossification Centres
- In the Middle of the Growth Plate, Chondroblasts are found organised into Columns, surrounded by Lightly Stained Amorphous Cartilage Matrix which they are now synthesising as they mature
- Towards the Primary Ossification Centre, Chondrocytes hypertrophy to become relatively rectangularly shaped (Nuclei also becomes larger, more rectangular and less densely stained)
- Towards the Primary Ossification Centre, the cartilage begins to darken in colour as it becomes mineralised by Hydroxyapatite, whose synthesis is dependent on Vitamin D
- In Vitamin D Deficiency, Rickets occurs as the Growth Plate fails to mineralised towards the Primary Ossification Centre
- Marrow/Haematopoietic Cells of the Primary Ossification Centre attack Hypertrophied Chondrocytes, destroying the membrane between adjacent Chondrocytes and causing the cells to die from Apoptosis.
- They leave behind longitudinal strands of mineralised cartilage, which run deep into the Marrow
- The erosion of the Growth Plate near the Primary Ossification Centre and the addition of new Chondroblasts to the Growth Plate near the Secondary Ossification causes the Growth Plate to appear to migrate towards the Secondary Ossification Centre.

- Within the Marrow, Osteoblasts are found, depositing Trabecular Bone on Mineralised Cartilage strands/ribbons (Bone stains orangy-brown), using the Cartilage as a template
- Osteoblasts are found in compact groups surrounding the orangy-brown Trabecular Bone (Stain dark purple due to nuclei)
- This is done to increase the strength of the bone, with the Growth Plate being a site of weakness in developing bones.

- Blood Vessels can rarely be found embedded in Large blocks of growing cartilage to provide nutrients and $O_2$ for growth

![Immatknee07.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Immatknee07.jpg)

# Elastic Cartilage (Pinna)

- Elastic Cartilage (Hyaline Cartilage + Elastic Fibres) is found within the Core/Centre of the Pinna and is highly cellular
- It stains very dark due to high quantities of Elastic Fibres

![Pinna01.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Pinna01.jpg)

- Like Hyaline Cartilage, the Elastic Cartilage of the Pinna has a Surrounding Perichondrium.
- The Tissue surrounding the Elastic Cartilage contains CT, Adipocytes
- The Stratified Squamous Epithelium of the Skin (Stains more pink and quite dark in comparison to the underlying tissue)
- Just under the Epithelium, oval-shaped Sebaceous Glands associated with hair follicles can be found (contain a central round Artefact towards the Skin where the Hair was)

![Pinna02.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Pinna02.jpg)

- Elastic Fibres extend from the Elastic Cartilage to run into the Perichondrium, which contains BVs
- Chondrocytes are still arranged in clusters

![Pinna03.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Pinna03.jpg)

# Hyaline Cartilage (Trachea)

- Contains C-Shaped Discontinuous Cartilaginous Rings to keep the Trachea Patent
- It contains Adipocytes, CT and Mucous Glands

![Cart01.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Cart01.jpg)

- Most types of Hyaline Cartilage are surrounded by a Fibrous Perichondrium
- Alcian Blue stains proteoglycans (GAGs, Aggregates, Mucous etc.) within the ground substance of Cartilage - Hence, Mucous Glands and Goblet Cells stain blue alongside Cartilage

![Cart02.jpg](%5B005%5D%20CAL%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%201abf71c897a64367801c0c72adb32b1a/Cart02.jpg)

- Chondrocytes are found in clusters, often with a central artefact and a small dark nucleus
- These clusters formed as Chondrocytes undergo 1/2 rounds of cell division, with these daughter cells not migrating far, forming clusters
- Proteoglycans are found in varying [ ] throughout the Cartilage Matrix
- Matrix appears amorphous and smooth/homogenous
- Perichondrium = Coarse Fibrous CT and is highly vascular (lots of capillaries)
- Few Chondrocytes are found within the Cartilage as avascular nature means that Chondrocytes have little access to Nutrients and $O_2$, meaning few cells can survive
- Those cells that do survive have a very low metabolic rate and therefore, the capacity of cartilage to repair is very low and takes a very long time to repair and repair poorly due to its avascularity
- Within the Inner part of the Perichondrium, Chondroblasts are found and migrate into the Cartilage, where they differentiate and mature into Chondrocytes (Appositional Growth)
- Cartilage does continue to slowly grow throughout adult life, notably the Pinna of the Ear
