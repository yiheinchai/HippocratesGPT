# [018] The Red Hot Joint

# Pathology

- The Western Model of Disease is based on anatomical pathology, based on the understanding of the origin and causes of disease at a cellular, tissue and organ-system level
- Aetiology of a Disease = Cause of Disease. The different types of Aetiologies/Diagnostic Sieve = CAT IN BED
1. **C**ongenital
2. **A**cquired
3. **T**raumatic
4. **I**nfective
5. **N**eoplastic
6. **B**lood/**B**iochemical
7. **E**ndocrine
8. **D**egenerative
- Pathogenesis = Mechanism behind how the cause develops into the disease.
- This is the aspect of a disease that can be interfered with/stopped in order to treat/prevent the development of a disease

# Signs of Acute Inflammation

1. Rubor (redness): This is due to Dilation of small blood vessels/capillaries causes increased blood flow, making the inflamed region red. 
- This increased blood flow allows for increased delivery of antibody and antibiotics to the inflamed region
1. Calor (heat): This is due to ↑ blood flow to the affected region (blood is warmer than tissue, causing the area to appear warm). Chemical mediators also contribute to calor as inflammatory mediators released at the inflammation site engage in an exothermic reaction
2. Tumor (swelling): This is due to oedema (i.e. fluid in extracellular space)
3. Dolor (pain): Chemical mediators stimulate cutaneous nociceptors, producing pain
4. Functio laesa (loss of function): This is due to pain and swelling
- 1-4 are the Classical Signs and 5 is an additional sign

# Initial Inflammatory Changes

1. Vessel diameter ↑ (capillaries - Vasodilation)
2. ↑ capillary hydrostatic pressure, increasing the movement of fluid containing plasma proteins out of the capillaries into the extravascular space. 
3. ↑ colloid osmotic pressure in tissues (due to extravasation of protein-rich fluid into the interstitial space). This further aids hydrostatic pressure in fluid movement out of capillaries into the tissue fluid to produce inflammatory exudate.
4. Protein rich fluid accumulates outside vessels (exudate). 
- This appears yellow as proteins begin to crystallise and solidify
- During inflammation, arteriolar vasodilation, increased capillary permeability (due to enlargement of fenestrae) causes fluid extravasation (formation of inflammatory exudate) into the tissues
- Vasodilation of the Arterioles and Venules on either side of the capillary bed leads to increased blood flow/hyperaemia
- Neutrophil migration into tissues also occurs during inflammation

# Neutrophil Migration

- Neutrophils are attracted to site of injury by inflammatory mediators or as a response to bacterial toxins
- They move through endothelium via diapedesis

# Mediators of Acute Inflammation

1. Vasoactive amines
2. Complement components
3. Eicosanoids (Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes like Aranchidonic Acid)
4. Clotting cascade
5. Kinin cascade
- These mediators are often interlinked with one another to balance and fine tune the immune response

![Screenshot 2021-09-07 at 18.18.43.png](%5B018%5D%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Joint%209efd588e88c0471e86835874fe71d335/Screenshot_2021-09-07_at_18.18.43.png)

- Phospholipids in cell membrane should not be exposed. When exposed, they trigger the formation of Arachidonic acid

- Factor XIIa activates kinin and clotting cascade

# Inflammatory Cells

- Eosinophils and basophils are associated with chronic inflammation
- Monocyte = Macrophage circulating in the blood. They have a kidney bean shaped nucleus
- Lymphocyte = Cell with little cytoplasm and a large, circular nucleus
- Polymorphic Leukocytes = Neutrophils (Most common in inflammation and often called PMN = Polymorphonuclear Leukocyte), Eosinophil and Basophil
- Macrophage = Monocyte in the Tissue

![Screenshot 2021-09-07 at 18.34.29.png](%5B018%5D%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Joint%209efd588e88c0471e86835874fe71d335/Screenshot_2021-09-07_at_18.34.29.png)

### Inflammatory Cell Family Tree

- In acute inflammation, there is increased production of WBCs, causing the introduction of Leukoblasts into the circulation (Left Shift)

![Screenshot 2021-09-07 at 18.35.20.png](%5B018%5D%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Joint%209efd588e88c0471e86835874fe71d335/Screenshot_2021-09-07_at_18.35.20.png)

### Inflammatory Cells in Inflammation

1. Inflammatory Cells circulate within the blood and as the speed of the blood flow diminishes, they will migrate to the outer edge of the Capillary Lumen where blood flow is slowest (Margination)
2. At the edge of the Capillary Lumen, Ag on the Cell surface react with receptors on the Endothelial Lining of Capillary Cells which are upregulated/exposed in inflammation, activating the inflammatory Cells
3. The inflammatory cell adheres to the Capillary Wall, transmigrates through gaps between Endothelial Cells into the Tissue Fluid via Diapedesis

![Screenshot 2021-09-09 at 12.11.37.png](%5B018%5D%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Joint%209efd588e88c0471e86835874fe71d335/Screenshot_2021-09-09_at_12.11.37.png)

### Role of Neutrophils

- Acute Inflammation = Inflammation involving Neutrophils. Chronic Inflammation = Inflammation involving Macrophages
1. Adhesion to microorganisms
2. Phagocytosis
3. Intracellular killing of microorganisms
- Accumulation of neutrophil polymorphs within extracellular space is diagnostic histological feature of acute inflammation

### Role of Macrophages

- Macrophages are highly phagocytic and can digest anything due to the action of enzyme filled lysosomes. As a
result, it is possible for them to cause tissue damage due to the action of these enzymes released from burst lysosomes.
- They are also involved in the immune response but are larger and also phagocytose debris and apoptosed/old neutrophils alongside pathogens via the action of enzyme-filled lysosomes.
- After fulfilling their purpose, macrophages usually die however they occasionally stick around to form granulomas.
- Granuloma formation and pus-filled cavities are therefore dangers of acute inflammation.
- After inflammation has resolved, sometimes immune cells drain from the tissue via the Lymphatics (causing Lymphadenopathy as these cells accumulate in Nodes) or as Pus (Collection of Dead Neutrophils) or an abscess (collection of pus), which then must be drained via surgical incision
- The formation of an abcess will impede the healing process

# Effects of Acute Inflammation

### Beneficial

1. Dilution of toxins: Allows them to be carried away to lymphatics and delaying their arrival to target sites
2. Entry of antibodies and drugs: due to ↑ vascular permeability into extravascular space, leading to lysis of microorganisms through complement or phagocytosis by opsonisation
3. Fibrin formation: This occurs due to the catalytic conversion of exuded fibrinogen in the Clotting Cascade. It may impede movement of microorganisms, trapping them and facilitating phagocytosis, and serves as a matrix for formation of granulation tissue
4. Cell nutrition and oxygenation: This is essential as neutrophils have high metabolic activity and high oxygen demand. It also provides metabolic substrates required for tissue repair
5. Start of immune response: drainage of fluid exudate into lymphatics allows particulate and soluble antigens to reach local lymph nodes, where they can stimulate immune response

### Harmful

- Damage to normal tissues (enzymatic digestion, abscess cavities, vascular damage leading to ischaemia)
- Swelling in critical sites (epiglottis leading to asphyxia, brain/intercranial inflammation leading to raised ICP)
- Immune hypersensitivity reactions (Inappropriate response causing tissue damage and even life-threatening consequences}

---

# Outcomes of Inflammation

- **Resolution**: Complete restoration of tissues to normal/how it was pre-inflammation after an episode of acute inflammation (there are no residual markers of previous inflammation). This is relatively uncommon.
- This is different to Healing as healing often involves scar formation, meaning the tissue is not identical to what it was pre-inflammation
- Conditions favouring resolution are:
1.  Minimal cell death and tissue damage
2. Occurrence in an organ or tissue that has regenerative capacity (e.g. liver) rather than in one that cannot regenerate (e.g. CNS)
3. Rapid destruction of causal agent (e.g. phagocytosis of bacteria)
4. Rapid removal of fluid and debris by good local vascular drainage.
- **Suppuration**: formation of pus.
- When this occurs within a joint, this can erode the joint
- **Extension of Inflammation to nearby bone (osteomyelitis)**: Difficult to treat because difficult to get antibiotics into bone
- Once inflammation becomes chronic, it will not resolve and will only undergo healing via repair, resulting in scar formation.
- Regeneration rarely occurs following Chronic Inflammation as most tissues have lost their regenerative potential except tissues like the Liver

# Systemic Effects of Inflammation

1. Pyrexia: high body temperature due to exothermic reactions of inflammatory mediators
2. Malaise - Feeling ill due to circulating inflammatory mediators, Anorexia and Nausea
3. Lymphoreticular hyperplasia - Lymphadenopathy and Splenomegaly, where the Lymph Nodes and spleen become tender and painful
- ↑ ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), ↑ WCC (white cell count), ↑ CRP = Non-Specific biochemical markers of inflammation but are not useful in producing a specific Dx.

# Causes of the Red Hot Joint

1. Infection
2. Crystal deposition - Gout and Pseudogout
3. Flare in activity in chronic arthritis
4. Trauma
- The specific cause of joint inflammation can be investigated via Aspiration of Joint Effusion and visualising this under a microscope:
- Infection =  Presence of Acute Inflammatory Cells (Neutrophils)
- Crystals = Presence of Crystals.
- Birefringent (Crystals appear 2 different colours based on their orientation under polarised light) Long Needle-Like Urate Crystals is characteristic of Gout

---

# Gout

- Disorder of purine metabolism. Final metabolite of this metabolic pathway (uric acid) crystallises as monosodium urate, precipitating in joints (synovium), tendons, tissues
- Gout is often unilateral, affecting one joint and hence, rarely symmetrical
- Crystals become embedded inside cells, damaging them and triggering local immune mediate inflammatory reaction, causing Sx
- Higher primates lack uricase which breaks down sodium urate so are predisposed/more likely to suffer from gout
- When the Monosodium Urate crystals accumulate to form a mass, it forms a Gouty Tophus which appears chalky
- Crystal Deposition/Gouty Tophus formation most commonly occurs in the metatarsophalangeal or interphalangeal joint of the big toe
- These deposits are radioopaque and can be seen on an x-ray of the foot.
- Traditional Px with Gout = Aristocratic, overweight/overindulgent Male with foot up on a Gout Stool

### Causes

1. Genetics: 20-80% have a family history of Gout. This component arises due to genetic variation in urate metabolism
2. Sex: More common in men as men often include a richer diet including beer and pork (common foods that cause Gout) but also due to genetic factors
3. Overweight: ↑ risk of developing hyperuricemic beccause there is more tissue/purine available for turnover or breakdown, which leads to excess uric acid production
4. Alcohol consumption: Beer and Port contains purines so drinking large quantities of these increases purine metabolism and uric acid formation
5. Diet: eating too much foods that are rich in purines can cause or aggravate gout in some people
- This includes anchovies, oysters, brains, venison, kidneys in gravy,
lobster, liver, tripe, sardines, calves’ tongues,
sweetbreads
1. Lead Poisoning: inhibits purine excretion, causing Uric Acid to accumulate

# Rheumatoid Arthritis

- Systemic Autoimmune Disease characterised by acute inflammation in joint flare-ups and the presence of Inflammatory Cells (Notably Plasma Cells)

![Screenshot 2021-09-07 at 20.40.13.png](%5B018%5D%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Joint%209efd588e88c0471e86835874fe71d335/Screenshot_2021-09-07_at_20.40.13.png)

- Plasma Cells have a 'fried-egg appearance' and have an off-centred/eccentric spherical nucleus with coarse chromatin that resembles a clock face and a large Golgi Apparatus

![6ddb6cffc2f3b5cf4af3037b0e883948.jpeg](%5B018%5D%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Joint%209efd588e88c0471e86835874fe71d335/6ddb6cffc2f3b5cf4af3037b0e883948.jpeg)

![Screenshot 2021-09-07 at 20.49.40.png](%5B018%5D%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Joint%209efd588e88c0471e86835874fe71d335/Screenshot_2021-09-07_at_20.49.40.png)

- Rheumatoid Arthritis can be distinguished from local inflammation as Arthritis tends to be symmetrical across both sides of the Body/present bilaterally whereas Inflammation is only seen unilaterally (only affects one joint)
- In Rheumatoid Arthritis of the Knee, the Inferior Femoral Condyles have an irregular 'bread and butter' like appearance rather than appearing smooth and shiny.
- This alteration to the femoral condyle means that movement of the knee joint becomes more difficult (knee joint becomes 'sticky') and is painful
- This is different to Osteoarthitis as in Rheumatoid Arthritis, as the joint moves more, the joint becomes 'less sticky' as there is increased lubrication of the articular surfaces by synovial fluid that passes across them, making movement easier
- Type 2 Synoviocyte is a modified macrophage which digests particulate matter that enters the joint space

![Screenshot 2021-09-07 at 21.00.46.png](%5B018%5D%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Joint%209efd588e88c0471e86835874fe71d335/Screenshot_2021-09-07_at_21.00.46.png)

- In Rheumatoid Arthritis, Plasma Cells often accumulate in groups/clusters within the Joint Synovium , which are visible histologically.
- This is mainly seen as a sharp border between the Amorphous Eroded Cartillage and the Highly Granular Pannus
- In Rheumatoid Arthritis, the Inflammatory Material is called Pannus and is a collection of PMNs, Plasma Cells and Other Inflammatory Cells.

![Screenshot 2021-09-07 at 21.03.17.png](%5B018%5D%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Joint%209efd588e88c0471e86835874fe71d335/Screenshot_2021-09-07_at_21.03.17.png)

### Septic Arthritis

- This is caused by Infection following trauma with a penetrating injury but can be caused idiopathically
- It usually affects one joint unilaterally

![Screenshot 2021-09-07 at 21.05.59.png](%5B018%5D%20The%20Red%20Hot%20Joint%209efd588e88c0471e86835874fe71d335/Screenshot_2021-09-07_at_21.05.59.png)

- It can be Dx via Aspiration of Joint Effusion, Microscope the Fluid and Culture the Aspirate.
- Under a Microscope, you would see Acute Inflammatory Cells (Neutrophils and Macrophages etc.) which are not present in a normal Aspiration of Joint Fluid
