# Triceps Brachii

Action: 1) Major/Powerful Extensor of the Arm and Forearm
Extra Info: - The radial nerve and deep artery of the arm are in the radial
groove and they are sandwiched between the lateral and
medial head of the triceps                  - As Triceps Brachii crossses both the Elbow and Shoulder Joint, it can act on both the forearm and arm
Innervation: Radial Nerve (C6-C8 but predominantly C7)
Insertion: All three muscle bellies combine to form a single large tendon which inserts into the Olecranon of the Ulna
Origin: 1) Long Head = Infraglenoid Tubercle of the Scapula                2) Lateral Head = Above the Radial Groove on the Posterior Aspect of the Humerus                                      3) Medial Head = Just below the Radial Groove on the Posterior Aspect of the Humerus
