# [051] Vertebral Column I

# Spine

- Segmented column consisting of a stack bone elements, intervertebral discs and ligaments.
- Vertebrae are connected to one another via Synovial Joints between neighbouring vertebral arches posteriorly and Fibrocartillaginous Joints via Intervertebral Disks between neighbouring vertebral bodies anteriorly
- It has 5 different regions, distinguished by different vertebral morphologies: cervical (7), thoracic (12), lumbar (5), sacral (5), coccygeal (1-7)
- On average, there are 24 presacral vertebrae and around 6-12 postsacral vertebrae.
- Antero-posterior view: column appears to be straight.
- Lateral view: four dorso-ventral alternating curves:
1) Cervical lordosis
2) Thoracic kyphosis
3) Lumbar lordosis
4) Sacro-coccygeal kyphosis
- The first 3 dorso-ventral curvatures are formed by presacral vertebrae and hence, are mobile whereas the sacrococcygeal Kyphosis is immobile due to the fusion of the Sacrum to the pelvis in adult hood
- Lordosis = Anterior Curvature and Kyphosis = Posterior Curvature

# Postnatal Development of Spinal Curvatures

- Normal adult ranges of these curvatures are quite large (notably Lumbar Lordosis) as these curves may become more accentuated after the adult skeleton has fully formed (at around 25 yrs). This is dependent mainly on on age, sex, other factors (body weight, manual labour and spino-pelvic interactions during growth).
- Curves adjust and balance against one another as the child grows in order to keep the child upright, adjusting until the pelvis has reached maturity.
- These curves develop postnatally in response to biomechanical stresses that the vertebral column is exposed to as the child develops.
- These curves mainly develop due to adjustments in the shape of the of the intervertebral discs, which become more wedge-shaped as you descend down the vertebral column due to an increase in size in the vertebral bodies as you move caudally.
- Cervical lordosis: carrying head upright. Develops around 6 months (when babies start carrying head on their own, after muscles develop, due to the pressure that the upright head is putting on the inferior cervical spine). It is the first presacral curvature to develop.
- Thoracic kyphosis: already present at birth, but gets more accentuated throughout postnatal development due to the expansion of the thorax and its viscera.
- Lumbar lordosis: upright walking. Develop around 1 year old, once baby starts to walk.
- Sacrum and coccyx kyphosis: upright walking. Forms around the same time as Lumbar  Lordosis

- During postnatal development, the curves of the spine develop mainly due to the adjustment of the shapes of the intervertebral discs (which become more wedge-shaped vs rectangular), with the vertebral bodies appearing uniform and square in neonates.
- After the maturity of the adult skeleton, the vertebral body bone tissue reorganises itself to become more wedge-shaped and non-uniform, increasing in size as you move caudally down the spinal cord.
- These vertebral body adjustments (from square-shaped to wedge-shaped and changing size in adulthood) further accentuate the curves formed in postnatal development to make minor adjustments to the spinal curvatures
- Adjustments in intervertebral disc shape from neonate to adults (becoming more wedge-shaped) is much more significant in spinal curvature formation than vertebral body adjustments in size and shape

![%5B051%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20I%20147a5f07c9254a199215c0f7287bed83/Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_20.56.39.png](%5B051%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20I%20147a5f07c9254a199215c0f7287bed83/Screen_Shot_2021-07-28_at_20.56.39.png)

- In neonates, typical vertebrae (C3-L5)  are comprised of 2 separate arches (left and right halfs) and 1 body element, connected together by cartilage which allows all parts of the vertebrae to grow with age
- Atypical Vertebrae such as Axis, Atlas and Sacral Vertebrae often have more than 3 elements within Neonates (E.g Axis can have up to 7 elements)
- The left and right arch vertebral elements are the first to fuse (Between 1-6/7 years of age) and occurs first in the lower thoracic region (Around T12).
- The pattern of arch fusion is bidirectional, moving cranial and caudally from the T12/T11 towards the cervical and sacral vertebrae respectively
- The arches found cranial to T12/T11 completely close slightly earlier than those found caudal to T12/T11, so that the Atlas and Axis arches close around 5/6 years old and the Sacrum and Coccyx around 6/7
- The united vertebral arch merges with the anterior vertebral bodies between 2-6 years within the presacral spine and 16-25 years in the sacrum and coccyx.
- This fusion event of the presacral spine has 2 sites of origin along the vertebral column:
1. L5 (Earliest Origin Site from Year 2) - The Vertebral bodies and arches fuse moving cranially from L5 to reach T12 around Year 4
2. C6/C7 and T1 (The Cervicothoracic Border - The Later Origin Site from Year 3/4) - The vertebral bodies and arches initially fuse moving caudally to reach T11 around Year 4-5 and then later on, the vertebral bodies and arches fuse moving cranially to meet C2 and C1 at Year 4-5 and 5-6 respectively.
- After the closure of the presacral spine, the sacrum and coccyx close initially from the Coccyx, moving superiorly towards S1 between 16-25 years
- This complex closing pattern with different timeframes of closure is likely due to different demands on the spine for where more room for growth and adjustment of vertebral dimensions is required, with regions requiring more growth and adjustment closing later

# Excessive and Abnormal Spinal Curvatures

- Excessive Spinal Curvatures (commonly due to abnormal/excessive adjustments of spinal curves) are often not balanced by other spinal curvatures, destabilising the spine. Where these curvatures are not balanced, clinical issues can arise
- Hyperkyphosis = Excessive Thoracic Curvature.
- This is commonly seen in the elderly where less mineralised bone (due to osteoporosis or corticosteroid usage) causes thoracic vertebrae to collapse, causing excessive posterior curvature/kyphosis
- Hyperlordosis = Excessive Lumbar Curvature
- This is commonly due to weakness/dystrophy of the hip and intrinsic back muscles which are responsible for keeping the spine upright over the pelvis and the pelvis upright over the femur AKA Antilordosis.
- Weakness here causes the spinal cord to tilt anteriorly over the pelvis, which in turn tilts anteriorly over the femurs, causing Hyperlordosis

- Scoliosis: Lateral curvature and rotation of spinal cord (Most visible in the Coronal Plane).
- This can have congenital (e.g gene/developmental defects such as HOX genes defects), neuromuscular (e.g muscular dystrophies or connective tissue defects such as Marfan's Syndrome - Where Muscles and CT are unable to maintain the normal arrangement of the vertebral column) or idiopathic causes
- If the condition is rapidly developing, the spine will attempt to compensate for the initial deviation and rotation via deviation and rotation in the other direction in an attempt to keep the Px upright and maintain spinal stability
- It is more common in adolescent girls than boys. This is because girls have an earlier height growth spurt than boys, during a period when their vertebrae are narrower and less stable, possibly increasing the risk of developing scoliosis

**Congenital Scoliosis**

- Congenital Scoliosis can occur due to defects in vertebral segmentation at the level of somite production or their reorganisation into vertebrae due to defects in HOX gene signalling.
- Defects in this signalling can cause atypical vertebrae (usually at the junction between vertebral segments such as Vertebra which has characteristic features of 2 different vertebral levels such as Half Lumbar, Half Sacral or Lumbar Rib extending from L1).
- HOX Signalling defects can also cause the appearance of hemivertebrae, where half of the vertebra fails to form. Here, the side of the spine where half the Vertebra has not formed is lower down than the opposite side where the vertebra has formed, producing lateral curvature which is compensated for in superior vertebral regions, resulting in Scoliosis

# Vertebral Structure

### Vertebral body

- Anterior part of the Vertebrae
- It is the weight-bearing component of the vertebral body and hence, vertebral body size â†‘ as vertebral column descends due to the increasing cummulative weight of the spine above a specific point as you go down the spine.
- The Superior and inferior aspects of the vertebral body is lined with hyaline cartilage.
- Adjacent vertebral bodies are separated by a fibrocartilaginous intervertebral disc.

### Vertebral arch

- These are the Lateral and posterior parts of vertebrae.
- With the vertebral body, they form an enclosed hole (vertebral foramen).
- The Foramina of all vertebrae line up to form vertebral canal (encloses spinal cord).
- The Pedicles: 2 (left and right). Point posteriorly, meeting flatter laminae.
- Lamina: flat bone between transverse and spinal processes.
- Transverse processes: extend laterally and posteriorly away from pedicles.
- In thoracic vertebrae, the transverse processes articulate with ribs.
- Articular processes: at junction of lamina and pedicles, superior and inferior processes arise. These articulate with articular processes of vertebrae above and below.
- Spinous processes: posterior and inferior projection of bone. Site of attachment for muscles and ligaments.

# Analogue Vertebral Elements

- All vertebrae except C1/Atlas have a vertebral body but all vertebrae have vertebral arches and bone bridges connecting the vertebral bodies and arches
- All vertebrae have processes and rib homologues:
1. 2 pairs of articulating processes to connect 2 adjacent vertebrae via synovial joints
2. 1 pair of transverse processes for muscle attachments
3. 1 spinous process for muscle attachments
- These basic elements vary along the vertebral column and these variations are mediated during development by HOX genes which define the morphological characteristics and number of vertebrae within each spinal region
- Rib homologues in Cervical Spine forms a small anteriorly orientated process for muscle attachment and forms the anterior and lateral borders of the Foramen Transversarium
- Rib homologues in the Transverse Spine elongate to form costal processes to articulate with ribs
- Rib homologues in the Lumbar Spine decrease in size to form transverse processes
- Rib Homologues in the sacral spine enlarge to form sacral alar that connects to the Pelvic bone via the Sacroiliac Joint

# Cervical Vertebrae

- Identifying features:
1) Bifid spinous processes
2) 2 transverse foramina (formed between each transverse process and rib homologue) conducting vertebral arteries towards the skull and vertebral veins to the subclavian veins.
3) Vertebral foramen is triangular.
- C7 vertebrae has a longer spinous processes that does not bifurcate.
- Specific shapes for atlas/C1 and axis/C2
- Cranially and caudally orientated joint facets (joint facet visible in axial/transverse plane).
- Due to a relatively small vertebral arch and body, the gap between these structures (Vertebral Canal) is very large.
- When an individual ages, Additional joints (pair of uncinate joints) formed between uncinate processes of neighbouring vertebral bodies. These help to stabilise the cervical spine and support its mobility
- These uncinate processes are found on the posterior and lateral walls of the Vertebral body, just medial to the Foramen Transversarium
- Radiograph of atlas and axis best taken through open mouth, AP.

# Atlanto-Occipital and Atlantoaxial Joint Joint

**Atlanto-Occipital Joint** 

- Articulation between atlas and occipital bone of the skull, consisting of a pair of condyloid joints, found just anterior to the Foramen Magnum in the Occipital Bone.
- Synovial joint
- Axis is found just superior to the angle of the mandible when standing upright

![%5B051%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20I%20147a5f07c9254a199215c0f7287bed83/Screen_Shot_2021-07-29_at_16.08.23.png](%5B051%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20I%20147a5f07c9254a199215c0f7287bed83/Screen_Shot_2021-07-29_at_16.08.23.png)

**Atlantoaxial Joint**

- Pivot joint formed between the anterior bone bar of Atlas/C1 and the odontoid process of Axis/C2, allowing rotation of the head
- The odontoid process of the axis (extends superiorly from the anterior portion of the axis) rises up just posterior to the anterior arch of the Atlas and articulates with it

Ligaments

- The 2 Alar Ligaments connect the superolateral aspects of the Odontoid process to the lateral aspects of the Foramen Magnum of the Occipital bone, keeping the Odontoid Process centred and attached to the anterior aspect of the Foramen Magnum. They run obliquely
- They are found posterior to the cruciform ligament
- Cruciform Ligament - Cross-shaped ligament which stabilises the positioning of the Odontoid Process comprised of the:
1. Longitudinal Fascicles - Connect the Occipital Bone superiorly to the posterior surface of the Odontoid Process and the body of the axis inferiorly.
2. Transverse Atlantic Ligament - Connects the lateral aspects of the Atlas by running posterior to the Odontoid Process
- If the Cruciform Ligament becomes compromised or the Odontoid Process fractures, there is a risk of a spinal cord lesion at the level of C1/C2 as it is the cruciform ligament that provides the main stability to the Atlantoaxial and Atlantooccipital Joints

# Cervical Rib (Thoracic Outlet Syndrome)

- Errors in signalling of HOX genes (HOX genes not turned off between cervical and thoracic regions) causes ribs of variable size to grow from C7.
- This can be unilateral or bilateral and be of variable sizes and affects around 1/200. It usually is asymptomatic but when they are large, they can cause:
1. Compression of inferior trunk of the brachial plexus: can result in paraesthesia along ulna border of forearm, wasting of hypothenar and interossei muscles, ulnar lumbricals and adductors of thumb.
2. Compression of subclavian artery: can simulate and/or produce an aneurysmal dilation of artery proximal to compression. It can also cause related complications (e.g. thrombi in aneurysm) or ischaemia distal to compression due to reduced perfusion.
- Often diagnosed by the loss of the radial pulse when the arm is abducted and externally rotated and treated by surgical removal of the rib

# Thoracic Vertebrae

- Downward orientated spinous process.
- No transverse foramen.
- Rib bearing (formed via joint facets found on transverse processes + vertebral bodies and the rib).
- All vertebrae form 1-3 synovial joints with the ribs, depending on the rib in question. T1 has 2 joint pairs, T2-9 have 3 joint pairs and T10-12 have 1 joint pair.
- The movements of the thoracic vertebrae against each other are restricted by the inferiorly-pointing spinous processes that limit flexion and extension and the coronally orientated joint planes that best allow for rotational movements.
- Coronally orientated joint facets (joint surface visible in coronal plane).

![%5B051%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20I%20147a5f07c9254a199215c0f7287bed83/Screen_Shot_2021-07-27_at_20.05.06.png](%5B051%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20I%20147a5f07c9254a199215c0f7287bed83/Screen_Shot_2021-07-27_at_20.05.06.png)

- Typical ribs are connected to their vertebral bodies via 2 facets (superior and inferior) on the joint head to form the Costovertebral Joint and and 1 facet on the tubercle to articulate with the transverse process (Costotransverse Joint)

# Lumbar Vertebrae

- Usually 5 vertebrae
- No ribs, no transverse foramen.
- Large and robust
- Triangular vertebral foramen
- Sometimes dorsally wedge-shaped bodies in the elderly, especially at L5 (due to a life-time of compression of the vertebral bodies due to a lordotic posture).
- Sagittally orientated joint facets (joint surfaces visible in sagittal plane) and allow mainly flexion and extension.

# Lumbar Ribs

- Occur when HOX genes donâ€™t turn off between thoracic and lumbar regions.
- Supernumerary rib which arises from L1 (transverse foramen is often present).
- Located below normal last floating rib (rib 12) and can appear uni/bilaterally.
- Appears rare as not reported much in clinical imaging because most imaging of lumbar spine is done in sagittal plane where ribs are not visible, but is quite common (more so than cervical ribs).
- Not associated with medical conditions/asymptomatic (hard to spot).

# Spondylolysis

- Deformation/defect or a stress fracture of vertebral arch near where articular processes connect to the vertebral arch and one another (notably the superior articular process), and/or articular processes .
- This often occurs due to HOX Signalling defects causing improper closure of the vertebral arch to the articular processes or as this region of the vertebral arch is quite narrow and weak
- Can occur anywhere along the spine but is most common at the Lumbar Spine as this is the most significant weight-bearing portion of the Spine
- Caused by overload of lumbar spine, but a genetic component (E.g HOX Genes Signalling) is often involved, alongside factors like age, sex (men are more commonly affected than women as men tend to work in professions where they carry heavier loads than women)
- Dx via Posterolateral X-Ray of the Lumbar Spine where Transverse Process, Pedicle, Pars Interarticularia and Articular Processes looks like a dog. If this outline is broken (E.g Head separated from body), this is Dx of Spondylolysis.
- Spondylolysis does not compromise or alter the morphology of the affected lumbar vertebrae and hence, the entire spine maintains its shape

# From Spondylolysis to Spondylolisthesis

- Whilst Spondylolysis does not alter the shape of the wider vertebral column, it can progress and worsen due to maintained overload of the lumbar spine, further worsening the fracture.
- This development can cause one or more vertebrae to become unstable and slipping out of place (spondylolisthesis).
- Commonly, the vertebral column superior to the Spondylolysis/Fracture slides anteriorly to the inferior region of the vertebral column
- Spondylolisthesis: slippage or displacement of one vertebrae compared to another.
- Spondylolysis can be managed for several years by strengthening the muscular system surrounding the displacement site, weight reduction to reduce the load on the lumbar spine and reducing lifting of heavy loads/placing extra weight on the lumbar spine.
- Once Spondylolisthesis has developed from Spondylolysis, surgery to correct the displacement of the spine is the main course of action to prevent herniation of adjacent intervertebral discs which would destabilise the spine and cause severe pain via impingement on the closely associated spinal nerves that are emerging from the spinal cord in that region
- Spondylolisthesis is graded depending on the degree of displacement of the spinal cord

# Sacrum

- Connects spine to pelvis via sacroiliac joints.
- Usually 5 fused vertebrae, which fuse to form a single block of bone around age 12.
- Before 12, the Sacral vertebrae are separated and held together by cartillage from around 1 year old
- Once the sacral vertebrae have fused, there are no more synovial articular joint facets left, making the sacrum immobile.
- The only mobile joint of the sacrum is that between L5 and S1, with the joint facet orientated obliquely between the sagittal and coronal plane (found on the posterior surface, projecting anterosuperiorly)
- S1 and S2 are the largest vertebrae of the vertebral column, decreasing in size significantly as you move caudally
- They are Developmentally part of Vertebral column but functionally better addressed as part of pelvis due to their fusion with the pelvis and lack of mobility.

# Joint Facet Orientation and Spine Movement

- Cervical: joints facets facing superior and inferior.
o Movement: flexion/extension, lateral bending, rotation.
o Most mobile region of spine.
- Thoracic: joint facets facing anterior and posterior.
o Movement: rotation.
o Least mobile region of spine.
- Lumbar: joint facets facing medial and lateral.
o Movement: mostly flexion/extension.

# Architecture of Intervertebral Disks

- Between all neighbouring vertebrae, there is a fibrocartilaginous joint made via intervertebral discs (Atlantoaxial Joint is the only exception)
- No nucleus pulposus between C1 and C2 and in sacrum and coccyx.
- Annulus fibrosus: outer layers of fibrocartilage and collagen fibres organised obliquely in alternating directions and layers.
- Nucleus pulposus: gel-like fluid contained within annulus fibrosus.
- Between the Intervertebral Discs and the Adjacent vertebral bodies, there is a hyaline cartilage end-plate which anchors the disc to the vertebral body and keep them in place
    - The Hyaline Cartilage endplates are currently considered to be part of the vertebral bodies as it comprises part of the zone where the vertebral bodies still grow into
    
    ![%5B051%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20I%20147a5f07c9254a199215c0f7287bed83/Screen_Shot_2021-07-27_at_20.10.20.png](%5B051%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20I%20147a5f07c9254a199215c0f7287bed83/Screen_Shot_2021-07-27_at_20.10.20.png)

- After 40, more than half of the population will have some degree of intervertebral disc degeneration at several levels:
1.  Dehydrated nucleus pulposus â†’ reduced ability of the disc for shock-absorption
2. Weaker annulus fibrosus and brittle hyaline endplates
- This causes the intervertebral disc to become weaker and less mobile which can lead to a loss of height but as these processes are natural wear and tear, this is a pain-free process
- The more brittle annulus fibrosus and hyaline cartilage endplates can lead to:
1. Tears in the annulus fibrosus and the hyaline cartilage end plantes
2. Temporary or permanent **bulges**/protrusions of the annulus fibrosus into the vertebral canal or the intervertebral foramina 
3. **Herniating** or extruding nucleus pulposus through a tear in the outer layer of the annulus fibrosus or endplate
- Herniations of the Nucleus Pulposus through the Annulus Fibrosus usually occur posterolaterally in the Intervertebral Disc as ligaments surrounding the anterior aspects of the Intervertebral Disc prevent herniations in these regions

# Ligaments of the Vertebral Body and Lamina

- These ligaments are present to help maintain the morphology of the spine as well as contributing to the boundaries of the vertebral canal, making it an enclosed space
- Anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments: continuous ligamentous bands from skull to sacrum, on anterior and posterior surfaces of vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs.
- Anterior longitudinal ligament: thick ligamentous band that runs from occipital bone to sacrum, uniting anterior surfaces of vertebral bodies. Does not attach to intervertebral disks but runs over them.
- Posterior longitudinal ligament: thin ligamentous band that extends from vertebra-to-vertebra in vertebral canal behind the vertebral bodies. Attaches to each intervertebral disk and becomes narrower over each vertebral body, with diamond-shaped bulges where it attaches to intervertebral discs.
- Ligamenta flava/ligamentum flavum: connects adjacent vertebral arches, contributing to the posterior boundary of the vertebral canal (found posterior to the vertebral body but anterior to the spinous process). It has a high elastin content and hence, appears yellow
- Supraspinal ligament: Connects tips of adjacent spinous processes, found as a continuous ligamentous band running down the posterior aspect of the vertebral column, along the tips of the spinous processes. It is mainly visible in the Thoracic and Lumbar Region.
- Interspinal ligaments: Found between the spinous processes of adjacent vertebrae, adjacent to the Supraspinal Ligament and not found as a single continuous band
- Inter-transverse ligaments: connect adjacent transverse processes at each vertebral level of the presacral spinal cord.
- Capsular ligaments: thickening of fibrous capsule taking form of elongated bands in the presacral vertebral column. These form the joint capsules around the articular synovial joints formed between the articular processes of neighbouring vertebrae

- Nuchal ligament: Merging of Supraspinal and Interspinal ligaments in cervical region. It runs along the tips of the spinous processes but also extends along the length of each spinous process as well as attaching to the outside of the Occipital Bone. It is extremely strong supporting the weight of the head and stopping excessive rocking of head (i.e. during running).

# Trunk and Intrinsic Back Muscles

### Trunk and Intrinsic Back Muscles

- Shoulder and Anterior Abdominal Wall/AAW muscles make up superficial layer.
- Intrinsic back muscles are beneath shoulder and AAW muscles.
- They affect the movement of the spine as a whole and the movement of individual vertebrae against one another
- Generally, the antagonists of intrinsic back muscles = Anterior Abdominal Wall muscles
- These muscles facilitate extension of the head against the spine, extension of the spine and rotation of the spine

### Longitudinal muscles

- Together known as erector spinae.
- Run longitudinally down the midline of the back to connect skull to vertebral column to sacrum.
- Mostly involved in antagonising flexion, and facilitating extension of vertebral column and skull.
- Made up of: iliocostalis, longissimus, spinalis.
- Iliocostalis is the most lateral muscular band of Erector Spinae and runs from the Ilium of the Pelvis (Origin) to Ribs (Insertion)
- Longissimus is found between the Spinalis medially and the Iliocostalis laterally. It is the longest muscle of Erector Spinae and runs from the Sacrum (Origin) to the Area around the Mastoid Process of the Skull (Insertion)
- Spinalis - Most Medial Muscle of Erector Spinae. It originates from the Spinous Processes and inserts extensively onto the Nuchal area of the Occipital Bone. It extensively merges with the Semispinalis muscles of the head and neck.
- They rarely act individually and hence, are functionally known as Erector Spinae
    
    ![%5B051%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20I%20147a5f07c9254a199215c0f7287bed83/Screen_Shot_2021-07-27_at_20.14.23.png](%5B051%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20I%20147a5f07c9254a199215c0f7287bed83/Screen_Shot_2021-07-27_at_20.14.23.png)
    

### Transverse muscles

- Smaller muscles, found deep to erector spinae.
- Important for rotating and lateral bending of the spine as a whole and can move neighbouring vertebrae against each other.
- They are notably involved in fine-tuning the movements produced by the powerful Erector Spinae Muscles to prevent damage to structures associated with the vertebrae such as Discs and Nerves
- Most prominent transverse muscle is in the lumbar region and is called multifidus.
- A weakened multifidus is a common cause of lower back pain, notably in the elderly who are less active. Atrophy of this muscle means there is reduce opposition to the actions of the anterior abdominal wall muscles, leading to lower back pain
- Close antagonist to transversus abdominis.

# Thoracolumbar Fascia

- Diamond-Shaped region of Fascia that covers intrinsic back muscles and is continuous with superficial lamina/deep cervical fascia at back of neck.
- It is the posterior counterpart of the anterior abdominal aponeurosis and together, provide a 2 point anchoring system for the anterior abdominal wall muscles and intrinsic back muscles
- In lumbar region, consists of 3 layers:
1) Posterior/superficial - It wraps the intrinsic back muscles against the spinous and transverse processes
2) Middle - Separates the Intrinsic Back Muscles (covered by the Posterior layer of the Thoracolumbar Fascia, containing) and Quadratus Lumborum (Posterior Abdominal Wall Muscle)
3) Anterior/deep - encloses erector spinae in its posterior compartment and quadratus lumborum in its anterior compartment.
- All three layers have a common anchoring point at the transverse process of the Lumbar Vertebrae whilst the Anterior/Deep Layer also has an anchoring point at the spinous process of the Lumbar Vertebrae
