# [052] Vertebral Column II

# Spinal Cord Boundaries

- Continuous tube formed by stacked vertebrae C1 to S5 and intervertebral discs, between the vertebral bodies and arches.
- Anterior boundary: vertebral body, intervertebral discs and posterior longitudinal ligament.
- Posterior boundary: adjacent laminae (vertebral arches) and ligamenta flava.
- Lateral openings (intervertebral foramen): formed between pairs of adjacent vertebrae, bounded superiorly and inferiorly by the vertebral pedicles. Each vertebra contributes half of opening. These are found regularly/segmentally down the vertebral column
- Connects to the skull superiorly via the Foramen Magnum and is closed off inferiorly by the tip of the sacrum
- As you move inferiorly, the vertebral canal appears to gets smaller and narrower but the vertebral bodies also get larger, causing the vertebral canal to appear smaller in comparison to the vertebral body at the associated spinal level when in fact, it maintains a rarely uniform size down the vertebral column

# Contents of the Spinal Cord

- Epidural fat pad (contains internal venous plexus of the spine). This is found superficial to the meninges. This protects and keeps the meninges and the spinal cord in place
- Meninges of spinal cord (continuous with meninges of cerebrum) and cerebrospinal fluid. These serve to protect the CNS
- Spinal cord
- Spinal Nerve roots are found leaving the spinal cord through the intervertebral foramen.
- Most spinal nerves are mixed nerves, containing sensory fibres conducting information to the CNS and motor fibres conducting information to effectors

# Meninges

- Continuous 3 layered protective sleeve of cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord.
- Dura mater (Most Superficial), arachnoid mater, pia mater (Most Deep)
- All 3 meninges are closely attaches to the spinal nerves that leave through the intervertebral foramina
- Where the dorsal and ventral roots of the spinal nerve form ganglia, just before each rami leaves the intervertebral foramen, the meninges merge with the coverings of the spinal nerves, over the ganglia, to form a dural sheath.

### Dura Mater

- Outer-most layer, thick, fibrous sheet.
- In the skull, it is comprised of 2 layers and is fused partially to periosteum of skull bones in order to securely anchor the CNS
- At the spinal level, the dura is a single layer and tethered only to the Foramen Magnum superiorly and the Second Sacral Vertebrae inferiorly. Inside the spinal canal, it is not attached to the vertebrae.
- Dura is drawn out with spinal nerves via intervertebral foramina before it merges with the coverings of the spinal nerves. This further allows the dura to anchor the CNS
- It is separated from spinal canal walls by epidural fat and vessel layer.
- Subdural space: small, capillary, potential space between dura and arachnoid mater. Normally this isn't a space but can be visualised as a space in some pathologies.
- It is highly sensitive to pain (notably during inflammation and infection), innervated by the Trigeminal and Vagus Nerves

### Arachnoid mater

- Middle, thin layer
- Sends web-like fascial processes towards pia mater and attaches to it (hence its name).
- Subarachnoid space: space between arachnoid and pia mater that is filled with CSF.

### Pia mater

- Inner-most layer, delicate, thin membrane. Difficult to dissect off spinal cord as it is tightly adherent to the spinal cord.
- Highly vascularised (often used to identify this dural layer)
- Denticulate ligaments: attaches pia mater to dura mater (piercing arachnoid mater), anchoring the meninges together.

# Blood Supply of the Spine

## Arteries

### Spinal Cord and Spinal Nerve Root Supply

- Blood supply is continuous along the length of the spinal cord but tributaries and drainage that communicate with the supply vary in different spinal regions
- In the cervical region, 1 anterior larger and 2 smaller posterior spinal arteries arise from vertebral arteries. These arteries then descend down the entire length of the spinal cord in the vertebral column to supply the spinal cord
- In thoracic and lumbar region, The spinal arteries from the Vertebral Arteries are supplied with additional blood via segmental arterial branches:
    - Thoracic =  Segmental Spinal Arteries arise from posterior intercostal arteries (which come from the thoracic aorta) before the intercostal artery runs in the costal groove.
    - Lumbar = From lumbar arteries (which come from the Abdominal Aorta).
    - These segmental spinal arteries are connected to spinal arteries via anterior and posterior radicular arteries which feed into the Anterior and posterior spinal arteries respectively.

### Vertebral and intervertebral disc supply:

- These are supplied by segmental spinal arteries:
1.  Cervical are vertebral arteries
2. Thoracic are posterior intercostal arteries
3. Lumbar are lumbar arteries giving off periosteal arteries.
- These Periosteal arteries supple bone tissue and via a network of metaphyseal anastomoses, which pass through and supply the intervertebral discs.

## Venous Plexi

### External Venous Plexus

- Located within intrinsic rotator back muscles lying posterior to transverse processes, spinous processes (main attachment site of intrinsic rotator back muscles), articular processes and laminae of vertebrae.
- This also drains the deep muscles of the back

### Internal Venous Plexus

- Located within vertebral canal but outside of dura mater (i.e. between dura mater and ligamentum flavum within the Epidural Fat Pad).
- Drains blood from vertebral bodies and spinal cord.
- Veins of the Internal Venous Plexi exit the spinal canal with spinal nerves through intervertebral foramina and connects with external venous plexus.
- Drainage to segmental veins of body wall:
1. Cervical to vertebral veins
2. Thoracic to posterior intercostal veins and then into the hemiazygos and azygos vein systems
3. Lumbar to lumbar veins and then to either the azygos/hemiazygos veins system or directly into the IVC.
- Vertebral bodies contain bone marrow and hence, are richly vascularised alongside the spinal cord
- Blood flow is multidirectional, particularly in the pelvic, lumbar and lower thoracic region, allowing cancers of pelvis and abdomen can spread into the spine, and then through the Internal Venous Plexus into the Thorax.
- Hence, biopsy and examination of the spine and vertebrae can be used to determine the degree of metastasis of a cancer

# Cerebrospinal Fluid

- Produced in choroid plexi of lateral ventricles of cerebrum.
- Circulates via 3rd and 4th cerebral ventricle and lateral apertures of 4th ventricle around cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord.
- CSF is continuously produced by the choroid plexi, leaves the ventricular system via the lateral and median apertures of the 4th Ventricles and is reabsorbed by the cerebral sinuses into the Jugular veins.
- A very small amount of CSF might leave the CNS with spinal nerve roots via the Intervertebral Foramina

# Spinal Cord/Medulla Spinalis

- Caudal extension of CNS (intra-cranial portion of the spinal cord is medulla oblongata and the rest is found in the vertebral canal).
- In the Lower cervical/upper thoracic region, the spinal cord enlarges enlargement: has to do with lots of innervation to upper limb (brachial plexus).
- In the Lower thoracic/upper lumbar, the spinal cord enlarges has to do with lots of innervation to lower limb. This is less prominent than the cervical enlargement
- Spinal nerves emerge from lumbar and sacral segments from Cauda equina (horsetail).
- This is a cluster of long spinal nerves from L2-S5 or Co1 (inferior to the Conus Medullaris) emerging from the most distal end of the spinal cord, which project down the vertebral column to reach their associated intervertebral and sacral foramina. It is formed from the Lumbar and Sacral Plexi.
- The inferior tip, where the spinal cord tapers off, is called the Conus Medullaris

# Spinal Cord Growth - Neonate to Adult

- Spinal cord and vertebral column follow different growth patterns from around 9th foetal month, meaning the Conus Medullaris is not found at the same level as the Last Vertebra, resulting in the formation of the Cauda Equina.
- Nervous tissue growth is at its peak during the first two years of life, with the brain and spinal cord reaching 50% of its adult size during this time.
- The other 50% of this growth occurs over the following 8-10 years.
- After this period has passed, only the PNS/Peripheral Spinal Nerves will grow in size in order to match the growing Musculoskeletal system and provide adequate innervation to this system
- The adolescent growth spurt of the Vertebral Column occurs around 10-15, where the vertebral column grows significantly in size and length whilst the Spinal Cord has already reached its final size.
- Hence, as the Musculoskeletal has a longer growth period than neural/vervous structures, this causes the vertebral column to grow to a longer length than the spinal cord.
- Similarly, the dura and arachnoid mater follow this Musculoskeletal Growth Pattern whilst the Pia Mater follows the Nervous growth pattern
- End of the Spinal Cord is tapered to form the Conus Medullaris
- Newborn: Conus Medullaris at L3/L4.
- Adult: conus medullaris at L1/L2. Growth of vertebral column overtakes growth of spinal cord.

# Filum Terminale

- The Dura and Arachnoid mater follow a Musculoskeletal Growth Pattern whilst the Pia Mater follows a Nervous growth pattern, causing the Dura and Arachnoid Mater to extend to S2 whilst the Pia Mater only reaches L1 (The Conus Medullaris).
- This means that the Dura and arachnoid mater extend past spinal cord to level of S2, far inferior to the Conus Medullaris. This, alongside the discrepency in size between the Pia Mater surrounding the Spinal Cord and the Arachnoid Mater surrounding the Vertebral Column, causes the formation of a large subarachnoid space in the lumbar/upper sacral region (lumbar/subarachnoid cistern), which acts as a reservoir for CSF.
- At the level of S2, the dura and arachnoid mater merge to surround the Filum Terminale
- The Filum Terminale is an extended strand of pia mater that runsfrom the Conus Medullaris, descending through arachnoid mater to attach to the sacrum at the level of S2, where it is surrounded by strands of Dura Mater which attach there as well.

# Position of Spinal Nerves in Relation to the Vertebral Column

- Only spinal nerves of cervical region emerge from the spinal cord at the same level of their respective vertebrae, very close to their associated intervertebral foramen.
- These spinal nerves project laterally/slightly inferolaterally to leave the vertebral canal via their intervertebral foramina (very short portion of the spinal nerve is found in the vertebral column)
- Spinal nerves of lumbar and sacral regions deviate strongly from their vertebral levels and from Cauda equinae.
- These nerves emerge from the spinal cord at/just above the Conus Medullaris and run inferiorly through lumbar/subarachnoid cistern before leaving through their associated intervertebral and sacral foramina (very long portion of the spinal nerve is found in the vertebral column).

# Location of Conus Terminale, Filum Terminale and Subarachnoid/Lumbar Cistern

- Termination of spinal cord at L1 has clinical relevance:
- Subarachnoid space and lumbar cistern are easy access points (lumbar or sacral) for:
1) Samples of CSF
2) Introduction of contrast agents (radiology)
3) Administration of anaesthetic and analgesic blocks
- The Lumbar Cistern is much easier and safer to access than the Subarachnoid Cisterns surrounding the Cerebrum, with a reduced risk of spinal cord injury (as needle is inserted inferior to the Conus Medullaris)

![%5B052%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20II%20587515f0313d49d58b7690096e868d7c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-27_at_20.37.15.png](%5B052%5D%20Vertebral%20Column%20II%20587515f0313d49d58b7690096e868d7c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-27_at_20.37.15.png)

# Spinal Anaesthesia

- Anaesthetic agent injected into subarachnoid space, into cerebrospinal fluid.
- Only small amounts of agent needed to achieve an effect and it is fast acting (< 5 minutes).
- Usually not administered above L1 as this is the position of the Conus Medullaris, so insertion of a needle superior to L1 can cause spinal cord damage.
- When inserting a needle below L1, the nerves of the Cauda Equina usually move around the needle upon insertion and hence, are not damaged
- Using a ‘heavy weight’ agent, distribution of the Spinal Anaesthesia up or down spine and unilateral administration can be achieved.
- Suitable for surgical procedures of lower abdomen, pelvis and lower limbs.
- It is preferable over general anaesthesia as it has a lower risk of mortality as it has a less extreme impact on the Px's homeostatic and physiological processes

# Epidural Anaesthesia (Extradural)

- Agent placed in epidural space, superficial to the Dura Mater (between the Dura Mater and Vertebral Column), so no meninges are punctured.
- It is used to relieve pain only
- As the Anaesthesia does not reach the CSF surrounding the spinal cord, the Anaesthetic exerts its effects on the roots of the spinal nerves in the intervertebral foramen, surrounding the administration site
- Theoretically applicable everywhere on spine as no risk of spinal cord damage (as meninges are not penetrated). In practice, it is restricted to below L1 to avoid risk of spinal cord damage upon insertion
- As the Analgesia is not being administered directly into the CSF, it does not directly exert an effect on the Spinal Cord. This means that the pain relief established not as fast as spinal anaesthesia.
- Larger amounts of agent fluid needed.
- Catheter can be inserted for top-up as the anaesthesia does not need to be administered too close to the spinal cord and meninges. This is particularly useful for longer labours
- Does not result automatically in a neuromuscular block. Important when used in labour pain control as it allows for muscle use (E.g in Contractions) without pain.
