# [029] The Hand

# Landmarks of the Hand

- The digits are numbered I – V:
- I is the thumb - The thumb is rotated 90° clockwise and hence, perpendicular to the other fingers
- V is the pinkie finger
- There are two notable “meaty bulges” on the palm of the hand:
1) There’s one at the base of the thumb called the thenar eminence
2) There is another at the base of the pinkie called the hypothenar eminence

    ### Bones of the Hand - 27 of them
    
    - There are 8 carpal bones that form an arched oval when articulated
    - There are 5 metacarpals that form the palm of the hand
    - There are 14 phalanges
    1) Digits II – V have three, a proximal, intermediate and distal
    2) Digit I has two, a proximal and distal
    - Each of the metacarpals and phalanges has a base, shaft and head

# Joints of the Hand

### Wrist Joint

- This is a synovial joint between the radius and articular disc overlying the ulna and the proximal carpal bones
- It allows abduction/adduction and flexion/extension (circumduction overall)

### Midcarpal Joint

- This is between the proximal and distal row of carpal bones
- There is limited flexion/extension

### Carpometacarpal Joint (CMC)

- These are the joints between the bases of the metacarpals and the distal row of carpal bones (found within the palm of the hand)
- There is a very limited range of motion in digits II – V, just a little bit of gliding movement
- The articulation for digit I between the trapezium and the metacarpal of the thumb is saddle shaped, permitting flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, rotation, circumduction and opposition
- This is one of the two reasons the thumb has the wider range of movement than the other joints

### Metacarpophalangeal Joint (MP)

- These are the joints between the metacarpals and the proximal phalanges (found at the distal ends of the palm, forming the knuckles)
- For digits II – V, there is a wide range of movements possible including flexion/extension, abduction/adduction and circumduction
- For the thumb it only allows flexion/extension as it is a hinge joint here, however, this is insignificant as the joint between the metacarpal and the trapezium is so mobile

### Inter-Phalangeal Joints (IP)

- These are the joints between the phalanges (found within the fingers)
- There is 1 IP joint in the thumb and 2 IP joints in Digits II-V (Proximal IP Joint = Between Proximal and Middle Phalanges and Distal IP Joint = Between Middle and Distal IP Joint)
- These are simple hinge joints that allow flexion and extension

---

# Ligaments of the Hand

- For the MCP and IP joints, there is a palmar ligament on the anterior surface which helps to reinforce the joint capsule
- They also have medial and lateral collateral ligaments on the side, which also help to strengthen those joints
- The most important ligament in determining movements are the deep transverse metacarpal ligaments
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.16.01.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.16.01.png)
    
    - This shows the hand in a palmar/anterior view
    - There are individual Deep Transverse Metacarpal Ligaments ligaments between the heads/distal ends of the metacarpals and connect the MCP joints of digits II – V
    - These restrict the spreading movements of metacarpals II – V which result in the metacarpals of the palm working as a unit
    - This deep transverse metacarpal ligament does not extend to the thumb, which acts as the second reason that the thumb is capable of a wide range of movements compared to the other digits, the first being the saddle-shaped MCP joint
    - The thumb is not bound to the palm by the deep transverse metacarpal ligaments
        
        ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.39.12.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.39.12.png)
        
        **On the palmar surface:**
        
        - The flexor retinaculum runs between the carpal bones and forms the roof of the carpal tunnel
        - The tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus, along with flexor pollicis longus run underneath flexor retinaculum
        - The purpose of the flexor retinaculum is to prevent the tendons from moving outward from one another and leaving/bursting out from the Carpal Tunnel during flexion, keeping them tight against the wrist
        - The palmar aponeurosis is a big, fan-shaped ligament that covers the palm of the hand and protects deep structures (vessels, nerves and tendons)
        - It is strengthened in a few different places that run out to digits II – V
        - It is connected to palmaris longus
        - Although not everyone will have a palmaris longus muscle they will have a palmar aponeurosis
        - It is just deep to the skin and superficial to structures of interest
        
        **On the dorsal surface:**
        
        - The extensor retinaculum has the same role for the extensor digitorum, along with flexors of the thumb, index finger and little finger
        - This again binds the extensor tendons and keeps the tendons close to the back of the wrist so that they don’t bolster out/burst out of the Carpal Tunnel during Extension
        - Flexor retinaculum is much stronger, thicker and tougher than extensor retinaculum as we are capable of much more powerful flexion of the digits than we are extension of the digits

# Movement of the Digits (MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS LECTURE)

![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.46.43.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.46.43.png)

**For Digits II-V:**

- Abduction is the movement of the digits away from the midline
(middle finger) and the middle finger can abduct from the midline towards either side
- Adduction is movement of the digits towards the midline
- Abduction and Adduction are possible due to the MCP joints
- Flexion/extension and therefore circumduction can also be carried out
- Flexion and extension of the MCP and IP joints can take place
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.47.42.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.47.42.png)
    

**For Digit I/The Thumb:**

- It does all of the same movements, but turned 90° to the rest of the digits
- Flexion and extension occur across the palm of the hand and adduction/abduction at 90° to the rest of the fingers
- The thumb is capable of opposition
- This range of movements is due to the Carpometacarpal Joint of the Thumb

# Posterior Extrinsic Muscles and the Extensor Hood

- Extrinsic Muscles have their origin within the Forearm but insert on the hand to act on the fingers
- Extensor digitorum splits into four tendons
o They each have their own synovial sheets
o They run underneath the extensor retinaculum which keeps them pressed close to the back of the hand
o They split and go to digits II – V
o They form expansions/extensor hoods/dorsal digital expansions as the tendons fan out and insert onto different digits
- They each split into three:
1) The central one inserts onto the middle phalanx
2) The two lateral ones insert onto the distal phalanx
- Other muscles insert onto the extensor hoods, which has mechanical consequences
- There are accessory extensors to the hand, some of which insert onto the extensor hoods:
o The little finger has the extensor digit minimi
o The index finger has extensor indicus
- The thumb has extensor hoods formed in a different way
- The thumb has two extensors, extensor pollicis longus and brevis which are again muscles of the posterior compartment of the forearm
o Longus inserts onto the distal phalanx of the thumb
o Brevis inserts onto the proximal phalanx
    - This mimics the insertion of the Tendons of Extensor Digitorum on Digits II-V that arises from the Extensor Hoods of Extensor Digitorum
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.53.27.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.53.27.png)
    

### Extensor Hood

- The corners of the extensor hood wraps around the distal end of the metacarpal and attaches to the deep transverse metacarpal ligament on each digit (except I)
- It is triangular in shape, with an apex on the anterior surface of the Distal Phalanx that is formed from the convergence of the 2 lateral slips of the Tendon of Extensor Digitorum,
- Other muscles, including some of the intrinsic muscles of the hand, insert onto them as well
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.54.50.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.54.50.png)

# Anterior Extrinsic Muscles and their Tests

- There are nine tendons (flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis have 8 - 4 each - and there is also the tendon of flexor pollicis longus) which are surrounded by a synovial sheath and enter deep to the flexor retinaculum, through the carpal tunnel
- They each insert onto their respective digits with their own synovial sheaths, which are in turn surrounded by fibrous digital sheaths
- These sheaths are deep to the skin and palmar aponeurosis (and so protected by it) but are superficial to the intrinsic muscles
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.56.34.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.56.34.png)
    
- The tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis splits to insert onto the sides/edges of the middle phalanx of digits II – V
- The tendons of flexor digitorum profundus, which are deep to the tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis, travel superficially through the split in the tendon of Flexor Digitorum Superficialis to insert onto the distal phalanx of digits II – V
- The tendon of flexor pollicis longus inserts onto the distal phalanx of digit I and that of Flexor Pollicis Brevis inserts onto the lateral side of the Proximal Phalanx via a single, undivided tendon
- One of the intrinsic muscles of the hand inserts onto the middle phalanx
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.57.36.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_10.57.36.png)
    

### Testing Anterior Hand Muscles

- The key to testing different muscles, as they often perform similar functions is isolating those muscles
- For flexor digitorum profundus, the middle finger bone should be held down, and the tip
of the finger should flex if one tries to flex the finger as it inserts onto the distal phalanx
(superficialis ends at the middle phalanx)
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_11.00.12.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_11.00.12.png)
    
- For flexor digitorum superficialis, the other digits that are not being tested should be held
down to prevent activation of flexor digitorum profundus. This only allows flexion of the
middle finger bone
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_11.01.39.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_11.01.39.png)

# Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand

- Intrinsic Muscles originate within the Hand

[Untitled](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Untitled%20Database%2037d050e226ac40298afdcd498699d449.md)

[Themar Eminence - Found at the Base of the Thumb](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Themar%20Eminence%20-%20Found%20at%20the%20Base%20of%20the%20Thumb%20e2190c2bd75e4825a2f4d3a0f1cd6e87.md)

- Before the median nerve comes through the carpal tunnel and splits to go to the fingers, it throws off a small recurrent branch at the thenar eminence to innervate them

[Hypothemar Eminence - Found at the Base of the Pinky](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Hypothemar%20Eminence%20-%20Found%20at%20the%20Base%20of%20the%20Pin%20eabeb5826afd4595a010b7e9fcb757bd.md)

- The Deep Branch of the Ulnar Nerve (C8 and T1) dives between the muscles of the Hypothemar Eminence

### Interaction between the Lumbricals and the Interossei

- The lumbricals and interossei both insert onto the extensor hoods
- They allow flexion of the MCP joints whilst keeping the IP joints extended, modifying the actions of the long tendons of Flexor Digitorum profundus and Superficialis
- The lumbricals go from the flexor digitorum profundus tendons to the extensor hoods, and pulls the extensor hoods tight against the phalanges to keep the IP joints extended
- This means when the flexor digitorum profundus and superficialis contract as well as the lumbricals, the distal parts of the extensor tendons will be kept taut

- This keeps the distal finger joints straight

# Anatomical Snuffbox

- This is located on the posterolateral surface of the wrist, on the side of the thumb and can be seen more clearly when the digits are extended - This is called the anatomical snuffbox
- It is a triangular region
- The base is located at the wrist and the apex is located at the thumb
- It is bounded by three tendons:
1) Medial border: Posteriorly, there is the tendon of extensor pollicis brevis
2) Lateral border: On the outside/anteriorly of the thumb there are the tendons of abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis
- The floor is primarily made up of the scaphoid bone, the trapezium and the tendons of extensor carpi radialis, longus and brevis also make up the floor of the anatomical snuffbox

![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_17.42.23.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_17.42.23.png)

- Contents of the Anatomical Snuffbox:
1. Radial artery: Its pulse can be felt just in front of the snuffbox
2. Beginnings of the Cephalic vein: This runs through the anatomical snuffbox
3. Superficial branches of the radial nerve

### Clinical Importance of Anatomical Snuffbox

1. Radial Pulse can be felt in the Anatomical Snuffbox
2. Can be used to Palpate Scaphoid Bone (which is commonly a site of Fracture - Scaphoid is palpable within the Anatomical Snuffbox as it makes up the floor of the Snuffbox)

# Arteries of the Hand

### Palmar Side

- This receives blood from the ulnar artery and the radial artery
- The ulnar artery comes along the medial side of the arm
- It does not go through the carpal tunnel but passes through the Ulnar/Guyon's Canal
- It passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum around the inside of the pisiform and the hook of the hamate
- It then begins to divide into several branches:

### 1) Deep Branch of the Ulnar Artery

- This dives in between the hypothenar muscles, following the deep branch of the ulnar nerve at the base of the pinkie
- This joins the deep palmar arch, which is underneath all the intrinsic muscles of the hand and originates from the Radial Artery

### 2) Superficial Branch of the Ulnar Artery

- This moves medial to lateral across the palm to form the Superficial Palmar Arch
- This arches across the palm and is just deep to the palmar aponeurosis
- This sends out 3 common palmar digital arteries which travel distally between the individual metacarpals
- Before they reach the individual fingers, Each of these Common Palmar Digital Arteries bifurcates into 2 Proper Palmar Digital Arteries, with each one travelling down the sides of an individual finger (Each finger contains 2 Proper Palmar Digital Arteries which originate from Adjacent Common Palmar Digital Arteries)
- At the end of the Palmar Arch laterally, the ulnar artery joins up with a small branch of the radial artery

### Radial Artery

- This travels down the lateral side of the forearm and enters the hand through the anatomical snuff box. It sends a smaller superficial branch up that anastomoses laterally with the end of the superficial palmar arch that comes from the ulnar artery
- It then sends a deep branch which forms most of the deep palmar arch, with the small remainder being formed medially by the deep branch of the Ulnar Artery
- It is also gives off branches which act as the primary source of blood supply for the thumb (Princeps Pollicis Artery) and the lateral side of the index finger (Radialis Indicis Artery)
    - The Deep Palmar Arch gives off 3 Palmar Metacarpal Arteries, which join with the Common Palmar Digital Arteries from the Superficial Palmar Arch
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_17.52.33.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_17.52.33.png)
    

### Dorsal Side

- The arterial supply is just from the radial artery, which gives off the Dorsal Carpal Artery. This dives down/deep and comes across the back of the hand, sending off main branches called Dorsal Metacarpal arteries which runs between the Metacarpals Dorsally. These then split to form 2 Dorsal Digital Arteries each that go to the fingers
- The first interosseous muscle is palpable between the thumb and the first finger
- Other than this there are no intrinsic muscles on the back of the hand, all the other intrinsic muscles are on the palmar side of the hand
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_17.54.01.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_17.54.01.png)
    

### Arteriograms of the Hand

- Arteriograms are when contrast is injected into the vessel in order to be able to visualise them
- The ulnar artery can be seen going around the pisiform and the hook of the hamate
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_17.54.52.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_17.54.52.png)

# Veins of the hand

- The deep veins of the hand will follow the arteries
- The more superficial veins will form the dorsal venous arch on the back of the hand over the metacarpals, which is often visible
- They are drained by the basilic vein medially and cephalic vein laterally, the latter of which goes through the anatomical snuffbox
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_19.14.06.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_19.14.06.png)

# Nerves in the Hand

### Ulnar Nerve

- It travels with the ulnar artery and does not go through the carpal tunnel but instead enters the hand through Guyon’s canal between the pisiform and the hook of the hamate
- It goes medial to the pisiform bone and the hook of the hamate
- It splits into 2 branches:
1. Deep branch, which is found between the hypothenar muscles - This is mainly motor and innervates most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand, except for the ones
innervated by the median nerve (the thenar muscles and two lateral lumbricals)
2. The superficial branch, which is sensory and innervates the medial one and a half digits of the hand as well as the nail beds/fingertips on the back. It is motor to Palmaris Brevis

![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_19.18.15.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_19.18.15.png)

### Median Nerve

- This enters the hand through the carpal tunnel
- It sends a recurrent branch into the thenar muscles at the base of the thumb
- It gives off a palmar branch which supplies sensory innervation to an aspect of the palm (in orange)
- It finally divides into the Palmar Digital nerves, which gives motor supply the lateral two lumbricals as well as supplying sensory innervation to the lateral three and a half digits of the hand, the nail beds/finger tips on the dorsal side and to the medial palmar surface
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_19.22.41.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_19.22.41.png)
    

### Radial Nerve

- This only supplies sensory innervation to the hand, there is no motor innervation in the hand
- It sends out a superficial branch, the branches of which are found in and pass through the anatomical snuffbox
- These innervate the dorsal three and half digits but not the nail beds and the lateral aspect of the palm

### Motor Function of Median and Ulnar Nerves

- There are different ways the motor function of the hand can be tested:

**Ulnar Nerve**

- This supplies the interosseous muscles and two of the lumbricals
- This means the action of flexion of the MCP and extension of the IP joints will be mostly due to ulnar nerve action (as well as the median nerve) and can be used to test Ulnar Nerve function
- Forceful adduction (e.g. gripping card) of the fingers is carried out by the palmar interosseous muscles is due to the ulnar nerve entirely

**Median Nerve**

- This innervates the thenar muscles via its recurrent branch and thus allows forceful opposition of the thumb (E.g holding card between thumb and other finger)

# Wrist Fractures

- This often results from falling onto an outstretched hand
- The fracture site depends on age:
1) In older individuals, the fracture tends to be on the distal side of the radius, with this distal radius tending to be displaced posteriorly - This is known as a Colle’s fracture
2) In younger people, the scaphoid bone tends to fracture. This can be palpated on the floor of the anatomical snuffbox and palpation would result in severe pain if the scaphoid is fractured

# Injuries to Nerves in the Hand (Already Covered but Add Extra Details)

### Median Nerve Palsy

- Damage to the median nerve can occur at the elbow or wrist (just below the carpal tunnel)
- The median nerve innervates most of the long flexor muscles as well the thenar muscles and the lateral two lumbricals
- If the patient is asked to make a fist, neither the thumb or digits II and III can bend (thumb can't oppose and Digits II and III cannot flex)
- This is due to disabling of the long flexors and thenar muscles
- This results in a “Hand of Benediction”
- Digits IV and V can still bend as the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus is innervated by the ulnar nerve, which is not affected
    
    ![%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_20.08.52.png](%5B029%5D%20The%20Hand%2087b4d76779f14d60b31c7fcfe9ed7b09/Screenshot_2021-07-06_at_20.08.52.png)
    
- Another sign of a Median Nerve Palsy is an 'ape hand', due to wasting of the Thenar Musculature due to lack of innervation from the damaged Median Nerve, producing a deformity of the thumb which prevents abduction of the thumb (thumb remains next to the hand in normal, resting position)

### Ulnar Nerve Palsy

- The ulnar nerve can be injured at the medial epicondyle where it loops around or at the wrist where it is quite superficial
- If it is injured at the wrist it results in a condition called a “Claw Hand” as the ulnar nerve innervates the hypothenar muscles, as well as the medial two lumbricals
- This results in hyperextension of the MCP and flexion of the IP joints as the lumbricals cannot activate extension
- Therefore, there is clawing, particularly of digits IV and V (medial 2 Digits) as the Digits II and III are innervated by the Median Nerve
- If the ulnar nerve is injured at the elbow, the clawing is much less pronounced as the medial
half of flexor digitorum profundus is taken out, leader to weaker flexion in Digits IV and V, reducing clawing

### Radial Nerve Injury

- If it is injured at the wrist, sensory innervation at the back of the hand is lost
- If it is injured further up, there is a loss of function of the muscles of the posterior compartment of the forearm and this results in wrist drop as Px cannot extend their wrist nor fingers. There would also be a loss of sensation across the back of the hand and forearm
