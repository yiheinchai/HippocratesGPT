# [040] The Gluteal Region and Hip

# Overview

- There is the gluteal region in the hip is where the lower limb attaches to the trunk
- Between the below the inguinal ligament, lower boundary of gluteus maximus and the knee is the thigh
- The leg is between the knee and the ankle
- Everything distal to the ankle is the foot

- There are also areas of transition between the parts of the lower limb:
1. The femoral triangle is the opening between the abdomen and the thigh
2. The popliteal fossa is the opening posterior to the knee between the thigh and leg
3. The tarsal tunnel is a medially located structure that connects the leg and the foot

# Evolution of the Pelvic Girdle

- The big difference between the pectoral/shoulder girdle and pelvic girdle is the degree of connection to the trunk
- The pectoral girdle is loosely connected by muscles and ligaments with only one bony connection
- The pelvic girdle is strongly anchored to the axial column by both the bony attachment between the femur and the pelvis as well as strong ligaments that bind the pelvis to the sacral vertebrae
- This is due to the fact that it is the pelvic girdle and the movements of the hind limb that power the body forward so strong attachments are needed to withstand the forces transmitted up the limb and through the Pelvic Girdle to the axial skeleton.
- There is also rotation of the limbs to make them better orientated for walking:
1. The limbs originally sprawl out sideways (point transversely)
2. The forelimb rotates laterally so the elbow points backwards when the animal is standing
3. The hind limb rotates medially so that the big toe and knee point forwards
4. The elbow and the knee point towards each other whilst the thumb is positioned laterally and big toe medially

# Pelvic Bone

- There are 2 bones that make up the pelvic girdle - The Sacrum/Sacral Vertebrae and the Pelvic Bone:

### The Pelvic Bone

- The pelvis is made up of three different bones:
1. The largest bone that makes up most of the superior part is the ilium
2. The bone that forms the posteroinferior part is the ischium
3. The bone that forms the anteroinferior part is the pubis
- These bones tend to fuse into a single bone at some point during teenage years

**Ilium**

- Many of the muscles of the gluteal region originate from here
- The superior fanned border of the ilium is called the iliac crest which can be palpated on the body
- The Iliac Crest runs from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) which normally form palpable projections on the front and back.
- There is a thickened area of the iliac crest just posterior to the ASIS called the tubercle of the iliac crest
- There are also anterior inferior and posterior inferior iliac spines (AIIS/PIIS)
- Inferior to the AIIS, the iliopubic eminence can be found. This is a raised area of bone on the anterior surface of the Pelvic Bone which marks where the ilium and pubis are fused together

**Ischium**

- The ischial spine is found on the posterior margin of the Pelvic Bone and divides this posterior surface into the greater and lesser sciatic notches, which are further transformed into the Sciatic Foramina by the Sacrospinous and Sacrotuberous Ligaments
- The ischial tuberosity is a roughened area of bone on the lateral surface of the Ischium, inferior to the Ischial Spine. This is where most of the muscles of the posterior compartment of the thigh (hamstring muscles) originate off - It is also the bone upon which you sit

**Pubis**

- The pubic tubercle and Ischiopubic Ramus serve as the origins for lots of muscles of the medial compartment of the thigh

**Acetabulum**

- The acetabulum is where all three bones come together
- The fusion point between the 3 bones is right in the centre
- It forms the hip joint with the head of the femur
- There is a notch at the bottom of it known as the acetabular notch
- It is therefore open at the bottom
- It has an articular surface that is smooth, and this is a C-shaped surface around the internal edge of the Acetabulum called the lunate surface
- It has a rougher central depression that does not take part in the articulation (non-articular) and it is called the acetabular fossa

# Pubic Arch and Obturator Foramen

- The obturator foramen is a hole formed between the pubis, ischium and ilium
- In life, it is mostly closed off with the obturator membrane (made of CT), apart from one small superomedial gap in the foramen called the obturator canal, which allows structures to pass from the Pelvic Cavity into the Lower Limb
- Superior Border of Obturator Foramen is formed by the Superior Pubic Ramus and Inferior Border is formed by the Ischiopubic Ramus
- The pubic tubercle is visible on the front
- The pubis is joined to the other two bones by the superior pubic ramus which goes to the ilium and an inferior pubic ramus which joins with the ischial ramus from the ischium
- Collectively, the inferior pubic ramus and ischial ramus is known as the ischiopubic ramus

# Maturation of the Pelvic Bone and Congenital Hip Dislocation

- In the adult pelvis all of the bones are fused together, and you do not see any junctions between them
- In the infant X-ray the separate ilium (superior), ischium (posteroinferior) and pubis (anteroinferior) can be seen as well as the head of the femur ossifying in the acetabulum (visible as a radioopaque circle)
- On AP X-rays there is a smooth curve formed by the inferior borders of the ischiopubic ramus and the neck of the femur which is known as Shenton’s line
- It is a diagnostic radiographic marker for a hip that is intact and not dislocated
    
    ![%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_20.55.07.png](%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_20.55.07.png)
    
- When there is a disruption of Shenton’s lines, we know there is a hip displacement/dysplasia
- Most often, this is diagnostic of congenital hip dislocation/Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (CHD/DDH) in infants or young children, which makes the hip joint unstable
- There are synonyms for CHD
- If this is found early on it can be corrected
- If it is not corrected, it will progress and the displacement will become worse, resulting in
the child becoming increasingly more disabled

# Proximal Femur

- This is the thigh bone and the biggest long bone in the body
- The head of the femur is large and spherical and it forms the hip joint along with the acetabulum of the pelvis (it projects medially)
- It has a little pit in the middle of its articular surface called the fovea, which is the attachment for the Ligament of the Head of the Femur
- The neck projects inferolaterally and joins the head of the femur to the shaft of the femur
- The femur has greater and lesser trochanters
- The greater trochanter is lateral with its medial surface being deeply grooved for muscle attachment (This is the Trochanteric Fossa). The lesser trochanter is on the posteromedial surface and is found inferior to the Greater Trochanter
- The trochanters are areas for major muscle attachment
- The Greater and Lesser Trochanters are joined anteriorly by a little ridge called the intertrochanteric line (projects inferomedially from the Greater to the Lesser Trochanter) and similarly are joined posteriorly by the intertrochanteric crest (Projects more vertically between the 2 Trochanters vs Intertrochanteric Line)
    - There is a large tubercle called the quadrate tubercle on the intertrochanteric crest
    
    ![%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_21.27.28.png](%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_21.27.28.png)
    
- The intertrochanteric line projects obliquely from the Greater to the Lesser Trochanter and spirals down the front and medial end of the femur to join/connect to the pectineal/spiral line on the posterior surface of the Femur
- The pectineal line in turn joins with the sharp posterior margin of the femur called the linea
aspera (on the posterior surface of the Femur)
- The linea aspera continues superiorly up the femur as the gluteal tuberosity vertically whilst giving off the Pectineal line which projects Superomedially. This forms a “Y shape
    - When someone is standing upright, the Shaft of the Femur projects Inferomedially so that the distal ends of the Femur that are involved in the Knee Joint are closer together than the proximal ends that are involved in the Hip Joint

# Femoral Neck Fractures

- If the fractures occur between the trochanters (intertrochanteric) or below the trochanters, the blood supply is not impeded
- The majority of the blood supply runs across the neck of the femur to form an anastamosing arterial ring, before sending branches to ascend and supply the femoral head
- If the fracture occurs across the neck of the femur which is known as an intracapsular
fracture, this is severe as this will disrupt the blood supply to the head of the femur,
resulting in necrosis of the head of the femur, necessitating a hip replacement
    - Most Femoral Neck Fractures are Intracapsular

# Hip Joint and Associated Ligaments

- It is a large synovial ball and socket joint between the Spherical Head of the Femur and the Lunate surface of the Acetabulum of the Pelvis.
- Unlike the shoulder, the hip joint is a weight-bearing joint that is designed for stability and hence, the Head of the Femur and Lunate Surface of the Acetabulum fit together much tighter than the Head of the Humerus and Glenoid Process of the Scapula in the Upper Limb.
- There is a notch in the bone of the acetabulum inferiorly
- In life, it is closed off by the transverse acetabular ligament
- Just as with the glenoid of the scapula, the acetabulum of the pelvis is deepened a little bit by a fibrocartilage labrum
- This helps it cup the head of the femur better, but it is not as pronounced or as necessary as in the shoulder as the head of the femur fits the acetabulum much better
- The ligament of the head of the femur inserts into the fovea of the Femoral Head and comes off the acetabular Fossa to better hold the femoral head in the acetabulum
- There is a small branch of the Obturator Artery that travels down that ligament to supply the head of the femur
    
    ![%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_21.49.44.png](%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_21.49.44.png)
    
- The hip joint is a synovial joint. Therefore, it is surrounded by two membranes:
1) There is a synovial membrane that goes from the acetabulum onto the neck of the femur, surrounding the whole joint
2) The synovial membrane is surrounded by a fibrous membrane
    
    ![%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_21.52.20.png](%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_21.52.20.png)
    
- The fibrous capsule goes from a little bit further up on the acetabulum and goes to the intertrochanteric line on the front and the intertrochanteric crest on the back and so extends slightly further down than the synovial membrane
- The fibres of this capsule and its associated Ligaments spiral around the hip joint and therefore help to reinforce and stabilise it
- As with many of these fibrous membranes, there are thickened areas that are named ligaments which reinforce the Hip joint

Anterior:
1) Superiorly, there is the iliofemoral ligament

- It helps to strengthen the capsule and is a Y-shaped ligament
- It goes from the ASIS to the intertrochanteric line

2) Inferiorly, there is the pubofemoral ligament

- This goes from the iliopubic eminence to the femur

Posterior:

1) The ischiofemoral ligament goes from the ischium to the greater trochanter of the femur

# Movements of the Hip

- The ligaments and bones together determine what movements are possible at the hip joint
- Flexion/extension is moving the thigh forward/backward relative to the hip
- Abduction is pulling the leg or lower limb away from the body whilst adduction is bringing it towards the body
- These four movements mean that circumduction is also possible
- The pelvis can also be abducted on a fixed femur/leg (Pelvis is tilted towards the Fixed Femur):
- When you are walking and one of the legs is up in mid-air or you are standing on one leg
- Flexion of the Hip - Tests L1-L2 Myotomes
- This helps to maintain the pelvis horizontally, so it does not start to drop on one side
    
    ![%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_22.03.50.png](%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_22.03.50.png)
    
- The head of the femur can also be medially/laterally rotated against the pelvis
- Due to the angle and the very long neck of the femur this results in the greater trochanter moving anteriorly and posteriorly respectively when this is viewed from above

# Gateways to the Lower Limb

- There are various gateways to the lower limb
- Theoretically there are five:
1. Inguinal canal
2. Greater sciatic foramen:
• This is divided in half by the piriformis muscle which
passes through it
• There is therefore a route above piriformis and below
piriformis
3. Lesser sciatic foramen
4. Obturator canal
5. Subinguinal space below the inguinal ligament
    
    ![%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_22.12.19.png](%5B040%5D%20The%20Gluteal%20Region%20and%20Hip%205c309c40756a4684b010e2349c281803/Screenshot_2021-07-07_at_22.12.19.png)
    

### Contents of the Gateways

**Greater Sciatic Foramen**

Above Piriformis:

- The superior gluteal nerve, artery and vein all pass through here

Below Piriformis:

1. The sciatic nerve is a large peripheral nerve which travels through here - It is the largest peripheral nerve in the body
2. The inferior gluteal nerve, artery and vein
3. The pudendal nerve and inferior pudendal artery and vein
4. The posterior femoral cutaneous nerve of thigh which innervates the skin on the back of the thigh
5. The nerve to obturator internus and quadratus femoris 

**Lesser Sciatic Foramen**

1. Tendon of Obturator internus 
2. Pudendal nerve and internal pudendal artery and vein - These come out of the greater sciatic foramen and then loop back to innervate the perineum through the lesser sciatic foramen

**Obturator Canal**

- This simply has the obturator nerve and obturator vessels coming out of it
- They enter the medial compartment of the thigh

**Subinguinal Space: Many of these structures enter the Femoral Triangle**

1. The femoral nerve, artery and vein - The femoral nerve is the major nerve of the front of the thigh
2. Psoas major, iliacus and pectineus
3. Lymphatics
4. Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh
5. Femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve

# Deep Fascia and Iliotibial Tract

- The superficial fascia is disorganised and contains cutaneous nerves and vessels
- Below this, is the deep fascia which is an organised layer of connective tissue
- It forms a stocking around/surrounding and encasing the entire lower limb
- It runs superiorly from the inguinal ligament and iliac crest and is continuous with the deep fascia of the Leg
- In the thigh it is known as the fascia lata
- The deep fascia of the leg is called the crural fascia
- It has two primary functions:
1. It limits the outward expansion of the muscles when they are contracting
2. They compress the veins of the Lower Limb to aid venous return as the blood flow has to work against gravity

- Laterally, the fascia lata is thickened into a structure called the iliotibial tract which runs from the Tubercle of the Iliac Crest to the Tibia
- It encloses the tensor fascia lata
- The gluteus maximus inserts onto it
- It stabilises the Hip and Knee Joints

# Muscles of the Gluteal Region

- The muscles of the Gluteal Region are arranged roughly into 2 layers, superficial (larger) and deep (smaller) muscles
- Gluteal Region lies posterolateral to the Pelvis

**Gluteal Origins**

- The gluteal muscles themselves take origin from the lateral aspect of the ilium
- There are posterior, anterior and inferior gluteal lines visible
- The different gluteal muscles originate from different parts of the ilium demarcated by those lines and act to  abduct, extend and laterally rotate the femur

- Gluteus Medius and Minimus are important for stabilising the pelvis (prevent it dipping towards the side that is in the air) during walking (Stance Phase - When one side is bearing weight and other side is lifted off the ground) or standing on one leg as they contract on the weight-bearing side to abduct the Hip
- In the event that these muscles or the superior gluteal nerve is damaged, there is a classic sign of when one foot is airborne, the pelvis drops on that side as they do not have the gluteus minimus and medius to contract on the opposite side to stabilise the pelvis
- This is known as a positive Trendelenburg sign/gait

### Gluteal Bursae

- There are little synovial sacs called bursae
- These bursae occur between the gluteus maximus and either bony structures or tendons to reduce friction:
1. The trochanteric bursa is between gluteus maximus and the greater trochanter of the femur
2. The ischial bursa is between gluteus maximus and the ischial tuberosity
3. The gluteofemoral bursa is between the gluteus maximus and the vastus lateralis tendon

# Arteries of the Hip and Gluteal Region

- There is an anastomosis around the hip joint so that when one is contracting muscles, the bloodflow continues unhindered and there is a redundant blood supply in the case of injury

### Femoral Artery

- There are several arteries that contribute to the anastomosis around the hip, the major artery of the lower limb is the femoral artery
- It is a continuation of the external iliac artery
- It goes below the inguinal ligament (through the Subinguinal Space) and into the femoral triangle
- It gives off several branches, the most important being the profunda femoris/deep artery of the thigh
- The deep artery gives off the lateral and medial circumflex arteries, which go around the trochanters and the head of the femur and so contribute to the anastomosis around the hip which is called the cruciate anastomosis
- The most important blood supply to the head of the femur in adults is the medial circumflex artery

### Gluteal Arteries

- The superior and inferior gluteal arteries both contribute to the cruciate anastomosis
- They are both branches of the internal iliac artery
- They both pass through the greater sciatic foramen but go above and below piriformis respectively
- They supply many of the muscles in the Gluteal Region, with the Superior Gluteal Artery dividing into more Superficial branches that supply Gluteus Maximus and deeper branches that are found in the Plane between Gluteus Maximus and Gluteus Medius + Minimus

### Obturator Artery

- The obturator artery goes through the obturator canal
- It is a branch of the internal iliac artery
- It immediately divides into anterior and posterior branches, both of which supply adjacent muscles and join the cruciate anastomosis where it joins up with the Inferior Gluteal and Medial Circumflex Arteries
- The posterior branch gives off an acetabular branch, which gives off a tiny artery which travels down the ligament of the head of the femur to the fovea of the femoral head and helps to supply the femoral head

# Lumbosacral Plexus

- “The divisions and subdivisions do not need to be known so do not worry at this point”
- It is formed from the ventral rami of L1 to S4
- Nerves to the limb are from L1 – S3 so like the upper limb, the lower limb is multi-segmental
- The lumbosacral plexus can actually be divided into three parts:
1) The lumbar plexus which is formed from L1 to part of L4
2) The sacral plexus which is formed from S1 to S4
3) The lumbosacral trunk which is formed from part of L4 and L5
- The different branches divide into dorsal and ventral divisions - This go to supply the developmentally dorsal and ventral muscles respectively

- The major peripheral nerves coming off the lumbosacral plexus:
1. The femoral nerve (Dorsal L2 - L4) enters the leg underneath the inguinal ligament (through Subinguinal Space)
• It supplies all the muscles of the anterior compartment of the thigh and obturator externus
• It supplies sensory innervation to the anterior compartment of the thigh, and the medial aspects of the knee, leg and foot
2. The obturator nerve (Ventral L2 – L4) goes through the obturator canal
• It supplies most of the muscles of the medial compartment of the thigh, except part of adductor magnus and pectineus
• It provides some cutaneous sensory innervation to the superomedial aspect of the thigh

1. The superior (L4 – S1) and inferior (L5 – S2) gluteal nerves come out of the sciatic foramen above and below piriformis
• The superior gluteal nerve supplies the tensor fascia lata and gluteus minimus and medius
• The inferior gluteal nerve innervates gluteus maximus
2. The sciatic nerve (L4 – S3). It is the largest peripheral nerve of the Human Body
• It innervates all of the muscles in the posterior compartment of the thigh, part of adductor magnus and all of the muscles in the leg and foot
• It provides sensory innervation to the skin of the lateral leg and foot as well as the plantar surface (sole) of the foot
• It has two major divisions:
1) The common peroneal/fibular nerve consisting of the posterior parts of L4 – S2
3) The tibial nerve consisting of the anterior parts of L4 – S3

# Intramuscular Injections

- The gluteal region is often used to give intramuscular injections
- The upper lateral quadrant of the gluteal region should be aimed for as the sciatic nerve and other nerves and vessels are found lower and more medially
- This will avoid damaging the sciatic nerve or other structures passing through the sciatic foramen
