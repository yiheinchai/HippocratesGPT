# [049] The Foot

# Bones of the Foot - Covered Previously

- There are 7 tarsal bones
- They are roughly organised into three rows:
1) Proximal: Calcaneus and talus
2) Intermediate: Navicular
3) Distal: Cuboid and three cuneiforms (Medial, Intermediate and Lateral)
- There are 5 Metatarsals, numbers I-5 from the Big Toe (Medial) to the Little toe (Lateral). Each Metatarsal has a base, shaft and a head.
- Metatarsals articulate proximally with the Cuboid and Cuneiform Bones and distally with the Proximal Phalanges
- Metatarsal V has a prominent tuberosity on its base for the insertion of Fibularis Brevis
- The joints between tarsal bones (intertarsal) are synovial and complex, including the Transverse Tarsal and Subtalar Joints
- The subtalar joint is between the talus and calcaneus. This allows inversion and eversion of the sole of the foot
- The transverse tarsal joint is made up of two joints:
1) Talonavicular joint between the Talus and the Navicular
2) Calcaneocuboid joint between the Calcaneus and the Cuboid
- The transverse tarsal joint allows inversion/eversion as well as pronation/supination

# Movement of the Ankle, Toes and Hallux Valgus Deformity (Bunion)

### Movement of the Ankle

- With eversion and inversion, the ankle moves relative to the leg
- With abduction and adduction, the ankle is stable relative to the leg

![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_18.11.11.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_18.11.11.png)

### Movement of the Toes

- The Tarsometatarsal joints between the Tarsals and the Metatarsals allow for some degree of sliding.
- There is greater movement possible at the joint between the Medial Cuneiform and the First Metatarsal than the other Tarsometatarsal Joints. This means the big toe has a wider range of movements than the other toes
- Metatarsophalangeal Joints occur between the Metatarsals and the Proximal Phalanges. These allow for flexion, extension and limited abduction, adduction and rotation
- Interphalangeal Joints occur between the Phalanges and are hinge joints that allow for flexion and extension
- Flexion = Curling toes towards the Sole of the Foot and Extension is moving the Toes away from the Sole of the Foot.
- Abduction and adduction are relative to digit II (much more limited compared to that possible in the hand)
    - Adduction of the toes can be used to test the S2-S3 Myotome

### Hallux Valgus Deformity/Bunion:

- This is a significant protuberance of bone and soft tissue around the medial aspect of the first Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint due to abnormal stresses
- It angles the big toe laterally and crowds the digits
- It is treated by changing footwear, anti-inflammatory drugs and for the most severe cases, surgery

# Retinacula of the Ankle

- There are three retinacula of the ankle
- Retinacula are connective tissue straps that keep tendons in place whilst their associated muscles are contracting (like those in the hand). They also act as connections between the Leg and the Foot

### Flexor/Medial Retinaculum

- The tarsal tunnel spans posterior to inferior from the medial malleolus and is roofed by the flexor retinaculum
- The Flexor Retinaculum extends laterally from the Medial Malleolus to the Calcaneus
- The tarsal tunnel is the passage from the leg to foot (like the carpal tunnel for arm to hand), being a depression formed by the Medial Malleolus, Calcaneus and Talus
- The tarsal tunnel contains from medial to lateral, behind the medial malleolus:
1) **T**ibialis Posterior Tendon
2) Flexor **d**igitorum longus Tendon
3) Posterior tibial **a**rtery
4) Posterior tibial **v**ein
5) Tibial **n**erve
6) Flexor **h**allucis longus Tendon

(Remember - **T**om, **D**ick **A**nd **V**ery **N**ervous **H**arry)

### Extensor/Anterior Retinaculum

- These are two retinacula at the front/dorsum of the foot, orientated Obliquely (Distal and Laterally):
1. The superior extensor retinaculum is attached to the tibia and fibula
2. The inferior extensor retinaculum is Y-shaped (2 Headed Medially and 1 Headed Laterally). Laterally it attaches to the Calcaneus and Medially, it attaches to the Medial Malleolus superiorly and the Medial Side of the Plantar Aponeurosis

From lateral to medial they have under them:
1) **P**eroneus tertius tendon
2) **E**xtensor digitorum longus tendon
3) **D**orsalis pedis
4) **E**xtensor hallucis longus tendon
5) **T**ibialis anterior tendon

(Remember **PEDET**)

### Fibular/Lateral Retinacula

- These are two retinacula on the lateral side of the foot:
- The superior fibular retinaculum spans from the lateral malleolus and calcaneus
- The inferior fibular retinaculum spans from the inferior extensor retinaculum to the calcaneus
- The tendon of peroneus longus travels below the retinacula whilst the tendon of peroneus brevis travels above the retinacula

# Foot Arches and the Shape of the Bones of the Feet

- There are three arches of the foot (medial, lateral and transverse - The Medial and Lateral Arches are Longitudinal Arches).
- The Medial Arch has a greater curvature and reaches higher than the Lateral Arch
- These arches support the downward force/weight of the body during standing and locomotion
- The integrity of the arches is maintained by:
1) The shape of bones (they do not articulate together to lie in a flat plane)
2) Connective tissues (plantar aponeurosis and ligaments), which prove passive support
3) Muscles, which provide dynamic support

![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.44.05.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.44.05.png)

### Shapes of the Bones of the Feet

- Arches have a central stone called a keystone which maintains the integrity of the whole arch by locking the other bones into place
- Each arch has a different bone which acts as a keystone:
• Transverse arch: Intermediate cuneiform
• Medial arch: Talus
• Lateral arch: Cuboid

### Plantar Aponeurosis

- This is a central thickening of deep fascia composed of longitudinal bands from the calcaneus to fibrous digital sheaths of toes, protecting structures that run deep to it
- It supports the longitudinal (medial and lateral) arches

![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.48.00.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.48.00.png)

# Ligaments of the Foot

### Spring Ligament

- This is also called the plantar calcaneonavicular
- It is a broad, thick ligament that connects the sustenaculum tali of the calcaneus and navicular
- It supports the head of the talus and helps to maintain the medial arch of the foot

![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.49.09.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.49.09.png)

### Long Plantar Ligament

- This connects the calcaneus to cuboid and metatarsal bases and is the longest ligament of the foot
- It supports the transverse tarsal joint and is crucial in maintaining the lateral arch of the foot

![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.50.20.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.50.20.png)

### Short Plantar Ligament

- This is also called the plantar calcaneocuboid
- It is a short, wide and very strong ligament that connects the anterior calcaneus to the cuboid
- It supports the transverse tarsal joint and is important in maintaining the lateral arch of the foot

![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.51.14.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.51.14.png)

# Structures Supporting the Foot and its Arches

- Passive support is constant support which requires no energy expenditure to maintain support. This is established by Ligaments in the Foot
- Active Support requires energy expenditure to maintain support and is established by Muscles

Muscles/muscle tendons involved in supporting the arches:

- Flexor hallucis longus supports the medial arch
- Tibialis posterior supports the transverse and medial arches
- Tibialis anterior supports the medial arch
- Peroneus longus supports the transverse and lateral arches
- Intrinsic muscles of the foot support the lateral, medial and transverse arches

![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.53.11.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_19.53.11.png)

### Pes Plantus (Flat Feet)

- There are 2 types of Flat Feet - Flexible Flat Feet and Rigid Flat Feet
- The arch can appear normal when it is unloaded (flexible flat feet) but becomes flat when weight is placed on it
- It is typical in childhood (usually Kids < 5) but usually goes away with age
- Can occur later in life due to the loosening of ligaments with age or dysfunction of tibialis posterior most commonly or another muscle that provides dynamic support to the arches (this is known as a fallen arch)
- If the foot is flat when it is unloaded and loaded (rigid flat feet) it is due to bone deformity and hence, more difficult to treat/manage

# Blood Supply to the Foot

- The popliteal artery divides into the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, and the posterior tibial artery enters the foot via the tarsal tunnel

**Blood Supply of the sole of the foot**

- After emerging through the tarsal tunnel, the posterior tibial artery branches into the medial (smaller) and lateral (much larger) plantar arteries
- The lateral plantar artery travels laterally/obliquely across the sole of the foot before swinging back medially to become the deep plantar arch where it anastomoses with the deep plantar artery from the Dorsalis Pedis. This is found around the level of the Interossei of the Feet.
- Plantar Metarsal Arteries arise from the Deep Plantar Arch to run distally between the Metarsals, before each dividing into 2 Plantar Digital Arteries to supply the toes
- The medial plantar artery travels along the medial side of the foot to supply the big toe before joining the deep plantar arch

![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.29.33.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.29.33.png)

**Blood Supply to the Dorsum of the Foot**

- The anterior tibial artery runs down the anterior surface of the Interosseous membrane and becomes the dorsalis pedis as it crosses the ankle
- It gives off a small branch that passes between two heads of the first interosseus to join the deep plantar arch (deep plantar artery)
- The branches of the remaining Dorsalis Pedis include:
1. Arcuate - This passes laterally across the foot and gives off the dorsal metatarsal, which subsequently divide into dorsal digital arteries
2. 1st dorsal metatarsal - This supplies digital branches to the 1st and 2nd toes
    
    ![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.36.39.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.36.39.png)

# Venous Drainage of the Foot

- Superficially, there is a network of veins called the dorsal venous arch
- The dorsal venous arch receives blood from the metatarsal veins and drains into great (medial) and small (lateral) saphenous veins.
    
    ![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.37.15.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.37.15.png)

# Nerve Supply to the Foot

### Nerve Supply of the Sole of the Foot

- The tibial nerve innervates all the intrinsic muscles of the foot except for Extensor Digitorum Brevis (which is innervated by the Deep Fibular Nerve).
- It enters through the tarsal tunnel and branches initially to innervate the heel. It then branches into:
1) The medial plantar nerve:
• This gives motor supply to abductor hallucis, flexor hallucis brevis, flexor digitorum brevis and the first lumbrical
• This is sensory to the sole of the foot including the medial 3 ½ toes
2) The lateral plantar nerve:
• This is motor to all other intrinsic muscles of the foot                                                                  • It follows the lateral plantar artery on its medial surface, swinging laterally and then arching back medially.
• It is sensory a strip of skin along the lateral sole and plantar surfaces of the lateral 1 ½ toes, all via the deep branch and superficial branch

![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.38.47.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.38.47.png)

### Morton's Neuroma

- In some cases, the medial and lateral plantar nerves can fuse to form a common plantar nerve
- This fusion can sometimes occur between the third and fourth toes at the head sof the metatarsals
- This enlarged, superficial nerve can be squeezed during toe-off in the walking cycle, leading to inflammation and severe pain
    
    ![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.41.51.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.41.51.png)
    

### Nerve Supply to the Dorsum of the Foot

**Deep Fibular Nerve**

- This descends with the anterior tibial artery
- It innervates extensor digitorum brevis, the first two dorsal interossei (alongside the Tibial nerve) and the skin between the first and second toes (1st web space, very important)

**Superficial Fibular Nerve:**

- This is sensory to dorsal aspect of the skin and toes except digits I – II and the dorsolateral side

![%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.48.54.png](%5B049%5D%20The%20Foot%20f59afc497cea40de9ee39227688ce8c3/Screenshot_2021-07-10_at_21.48.54.png)

### Foot Drop

- This occurs due to compression of the common fibular nerve (before it divides into deep and superficial branches), which is the most frequently injured nerve in the body due to its superficial position as it descends inferomedially around the head and neck of the fibula.
- It impairs eversion, dorsiflexion of the foot and extension of the toes
- It results in foot drop and a high-stepping gait. This is because as the person cannot dorsiflex their foot, there is a tendency for the foot to plantarflex, causing the toes to drag along the ground, compensated for by a high-stepping gait.  The person also experiences a loss of sensation on the dorsum of the foot

# Cutaneous Nerves of the Foot

**Sural Nerve**

- This is a branch of the tibial nerve from high up on the leg
- It is sensory to the lateral side of the foot and little toe

**Saphenous Nerve:**

- This is a long branch of the femoral nerve from the thigh
- It supplies skin on the medial proximal foot
