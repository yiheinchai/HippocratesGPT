# [044] Workshop - Bone and Cartilage: Changes Over Time

# Joint Replacement and Osteointegration

# Introduction

- Joint disorders are second most common reason that people see their doctors (33% of all visits). Third most common reason is back pain.
- Musculoskeletal account budget in NHS is £10 billion.
- Orthopaedics 3rd most expensive speciality after mental health and cardiac.
- In NHS, 25% of all surgical interventions are for musculoskeletal conditions.
- Around 25% of people may develop symptomatic hip osteoarthritis.
- Total hip replacement is one of most successful surgical intervention (Most successful is cataract surgery).
- Total hip arthroplasty replaces worn out joint surfaces with new artificial surfaces.
- Many different types of hip replacements available.
- Over 102,000 hips were replaced in 2019
- Overall success rate > 95% after 10 years follow up.
- Numbers of hip replacements per year is projected to increase from 170 to 200 per 100,000 ppl
- Around 12% of Px with a hip Replacement < 55 yrs old
- The overall success of hip replacement survival at 15 years produces a failure rate of 12.95% in female patients and 10.68% in males aged under 55 years but only 5.74% in females and 7.29% in males aged 65-75
- Younger Px are more active (wear out hip replacement sooner and need the hip to last longer), explaining the reduced success rate of replacement as age decreases
- Revision operations not as successful as primary operation.

# Hip Replacement and Osteointegration

### Hip Replacement

- Invented by Charnley in Early 1960s
- They consist of a Shell (Fixed to the Bone), Liner (Replaces Acetabulum), Head (Replaces Femur), Neck (Replaces Femur) and Stem (Fits into Femoral Head)
- This replaces the articular surfaces of the Hip and the Femur
- Implant can be fixed into the bone using Acrylic Bone Cement (Cemented Fixation) or by bone ingrowth into the porous surface of the Acetabular Shell/Implant (Osteointegration)

- Developed in early 1970s and uses the same techniques seen in the Hip Replacement, replacing the articular surfaces of the Knee Joint
- Cobalt Chrome Femoral Component articulates with Polyethylene which fills the Synovial Cavity and is locked into a Titanium/Cobalt Chrome Tibial Tray
- These implants are mainly cemented to the underlying bone

![Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 11.43.49.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-27_at_11.43.49.png)

### Cemented and Uncemented Fixation

- It is designed to allow bone to grow over implant.
- Cement is formed by mix of monomer and polymer in surgery, to form a doughy mixture that is then inserted into the hollow intermedullary canal of the Femur following the removal of the femoral Head
- Stem is then inserted into the Canal, further affixing the Cement to the Canal to adhere the Prosthesis to the bone
- Osteointegration prepares the Intermedullary Cavity so it is slightly smaller than the Femoral Canal, before manually inserting the Femoral Component of the Prosthesis into the Femur (Press-Fit)
- Subsequent Osteointegration is dependent on interference and tight fit between the bone and the stem to stabilise the implant
- Over time, bone grows into the roughened surface of the implant to adhere the implant to the bone
- This usually takes around 6 weeks to occur
- In Cemented Fixation, the regular stem is surrounded by Acryllic Cement, with bone remodelling around the cement to hold the prosthesis in place
- In Uncemented Fixation/Osteointegration, bone grows up to the surface of the implant

# Wolff's Law

- Bone in healthy individual will adapt to the loads under which it is placed.
- If load ↑, bone will become stronger and resist load and vice versa.
- Bone formed in regions of high strain.
- Bone resorbed in regions of low strain.

---

# Stress Shielding

- As Prosthesis are stiffer than the surrounding bone, insertion of this prosthesis into the Femoral Cavity means that forces are transmitted through the femur in a non-physiological way
- Proximal femur has lost bone, distal femur has gained bone as stress is passed down femur, inferior to the Prosthesis (as stress is highest at the tip of the Prosthetic Stem).
- This is called stress shielding

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 14.41.31.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_14.41.31.png)

---

# Hip Resurfacing

- Metal on metal design as plastic would wear out too quickly.
- These are more Conservative, with shorter stems that do not extend as far into the Femur in order to reduce the extent of Stress Shielding that occurs
- These are predominantly used in young patients
- If revision required due to failure of previous replacement, you can use standard Total Hip Replacement (It doesn't have to be Hip Resurfacing Again)

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 14.42.02.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_14.42.02.png)

- These were developed as Polyethylene bearings of Hip Implants would wear down with repetitive use of the joint, releasing ethylene wear particles into the surrounding cavities which then cause an inflammatory reaction, leading to Aseptic Osteolysis via OC activity
- This causes loss of bone adjacent to the implant, loosening and abnormally positioning the implant and hence, causing it to fail and require revision
- Erosion of the Polyethene Acetabular Cup is asymmetrical as the Femoral Head is often not positioned centrally in the cup (It is usually placed more superiorly)
- Soft tissues surrounding the Hip Replacement often contain Macrophages which contain birefringent polyethylene particles

![Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 12.11.52.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-27_at_12.11.52.png)

# Problem with Metal on Polyethene Hip Replacement

### Wear Rates

- Linear wear: 0.1-0.2 mm/year
- Volumetric wear: 20-90 mm3/year
- Number of particles/year: 1010
- 2 million steps per year: 50,000 released per step

### Ethylene-Induced Osteolysis

- Ethylene Wear Particles are phagoctosed by Macrophages, which release proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, which recruit inflammatory cells and Osteoclast Precursors

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 14.50.04.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_14.50.04.png)

# Metal On Metal Hip Replacement

### Benefits and Problems

- Larger Heads can be used than Polyethylene Particles, with reduce the risk of dislocation
- Has 60 times less wear than metal on polyethylene.
- 100,000 metal on metal hip replacements used in UK.
- Metal on Metal Hip Replacements have the highest failure rate out of all replacement types (E.g Metal-Plastic Articulation)
- However, cobalt and chromium wear particles are toxic. Cause local toxicity.
- ALVAL (aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis associated lesion). Associated with release of small nanoparticles of CoCr in aggregates within membrane-bound vesicles of macrophages, leading to Local Necrosis.
- This is the inflammatory response caused by CoCr ions and leads to Fibrin Deposits and Local Necrosis
- Pseudotumours: Soft Tissue masses containing lymphocytes and large areas of extensive necrossi
- This mass is often associated with muscles and nerves and typically occur only around Metal-Metal Articulations

### Response to Metal Release From Metal on Metal Hip Replacement

- CoCr ions can be detected in blood.
- As metal wear particles (From metal-metal articulations) are smaller than Polyethylene wear particles (metal-polyethylene articulations), a given volume of wear in a metal-metal articulation produces much more wear particles than that for a plastic-metal articulation
- Wear particles release CoCr directly causing cell death and local necrosis
- Wear particles are phagocytosed by Macrophages, which release CoCr ions from these particles, some of which induce further local necrosis and some which bind to proteins to become Ag which are presented by APCs to stimulate a T-Cell Hypersensitivity reaction
- These T-Cells release cytokines to increase cell recruitment and chemokines causing local tissue necrosis and apoptosis
- Therefore, Metal-Metal Articulations induce a T-Cell Reaction whereas Plastic-Metal Articulations induce a Macrophage reaction

# Implants Designed for Osteointegration

- Used for bone cancer patients.
- Here, the region of the Bone with the Cancer is removed and the stem is cemented into the remaining bone to replace the removed segment.
- Bone Cancers commonly occur in young, many Px with Joint replacements as a result often need multiple joint replacements throughout their life so that the joint replacement remains functional (as replacements had low survival rate)
- It became evident that this low survival rate occurs due to the replacement of the bone surrounding the implant with soft tissue starts at the proximal segment of where the implant is cemented into the bone and progresses distally to the tip of the stem

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 14.46.26.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_14.46.26.png)

- When the prosthesis was surrounded by a grooved collar covered with hydroxyapatite, this allowed bone grows into the grooves (Osteointegration)

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 14.46.46.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_14.46.46.png)

- Grooved collar improves prognosis, by ridge of bone which covers the HA collar.
- Only 70% of patients with have osteointegration in prosthesis, for unknown reasons.
- In individuals where Osteointegration has occurred with the HA Collar, there is a 2% chance of failure but where Osteointegration has not occurred, there is a 25% change of failure
- Therefore, Osteointegration is crucial in reducing the risk of a prosthesis failing
- The rate of Osteointegration of the HA collar has been increased by making the collar more porous, laser sintering (Powder beads are fused by a laser, building the colour up in layers like 3D Printing)

# **What Goes Wrong With Articular Cartilage**

# Key Features of a Synovial Joint

- Synovium = Synovial Membrane
- There is an extensive blood supply to and lymphatic drainage from the Synovium, which pass through the Fibrous Capsule
- Proprioceptors (Muscle Spindles) are found embedded into the Fibrous Capsule

![Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 10.04.10.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-27_at_10.04.10.png)

# Osteoarthritis

- Hallmark signs are joint pain and functional impairment
- Cartilage breakdown with associated subchondral bone, synovium and peri-articular structures (structures near to the joint)
- Peripheral and central sensitisation of nociceptive pathways perpetuate pain
- Impacts negatively on mood and sleep (psychiatric burden)

### Risk Factors

- Idiopathic and very common – 8 million adults in UK (60% for Px over 60 and 80%> for Px over 75)
- Often there is an unclear link between Sx experiences and extent of Cartilage and Subchondral Bone Damage (Individuals with little damage can have lots of pain whilst individuals with lots of damage can have little pain etc.)
- Usually only diagnosed once symptomatic/functional impairment occurs
- Unclear of the sequence of events in early stages of cartilage failure
- Risk factors:
1. Advancing age
2. Environment
3. Obesity
4. Occupation
5. Genetics- generally polygenetic (few rare monogenetic forms)
6. Gender – female sex bias
7. Mechanical trauma – injury (Can lead to Secondary Osteoarthritis)
8. Nutrition

### Aetiology

- Causes of cartilage wear:
1. Dysplasia
2. Trauma
3. Infection
4. Preceding synovitis (Notably for RA)
5. Osteonecrosis
6. Osteochondritis
7. Bone Metabolic changes (ochronosis, acromegaly)
8. Neuropathic disease (diabetes)
9. Surgical meniscectomy (removal of Knee Menisci)

---

# Cartilage Loss

- Usually occurs at sites of loadbearing (E.g Knee and Hip)
- Increases in incidence with age but is not inevitable
- Osteoarthritis occurs when there is erosion of the cartilage extracellular matrix, exposing subchondral bone, leading to bone-on-bone articulation.
- OA therefore a clinical outcome of various pathological processes rather than true disease
- Structural and function failure of the synovial joint
- Loss of function can take 5-15 years
- Increased mortality 55% excess in all cause but also cancer (128%)

# Types of Arthritis

[Arthritis](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Arthritis%202156345e3e9045c8b444cd8fe59fed43.md)

# How Cartilage Works

- Smooth Articulating Surface - Collagen is found parallel to the surface
- Type II Collagen Fibrils - Hold Cartilage together and to the bone to resist swelling
- Type II Collagen Fibres are arranged in a more parallel orientation near the smooth articulating surface
- Aggrecan - Exerts huge osmotic pressure which inflates the Cartilage with Water to establish a Gel Swelling Pressure
- Chondrocytes - Secrete Collagen, Proteoglycan and Hyaluronan
- Hyaluronan - Tethers the Aggrecan within the ECM

![Screenshot 2021-10-27 at 10.16.02.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-27_at_10.16.02.png)

- Mild OA =
1. Fibrillated and thinned articular cartilage
2. Thickened, stretched Fibrous Capsule
3. Slightly thickened and inflamed synovium
- Severe OA =
1. Highly inflammed synovium
2. Bone Angulation/Joint Deformity due to loss of cartilage and Osteophyte Formation

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 16.08.08.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_16.08.08.png)

# Stages of Cartilage Breakdown During Arthritis

1. Normal Cartilage
2. Early Fibrillation (Appears Ciliated) with Chondrocyte Loss
3. Deep Fissuring with Chondrocyte Death and Matrix Loss

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 16.08.56.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_16.08.56.png)

---

# Cartilage Destruction

- Normally, there is a homeostatic balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways, regulated by resident chondrocytes
- There is Activation and enhancement of cellular metabolic/catabolic pathways, promoting loss of cartilage extracellular matrix
- Initially aggrecanase migrate into the Cartilage and degrade aggrecans, reducing the osmotic pressure and water content of the Cartilage, leading to Cartilage Loss with minimal loss of function
- Persistence of Collagen type II network despite Aggrecan destruction increases the Relative Fibrous Composition of the Cartilage, leading to fibrillation
- As Cartilage avascular, there are no incoming cells for repair following damage to the Ground Substance
- Once Cartilage is fibrillating, it is unable to undergo repair
- Early stages are reversible (pre-fibrillation AKA Aggrecanase infiltration)

# Changes in OA Upon Investigation

### OA Joint X-Ray

- Subchondral Bone Sclerosis - Bone Near Joint becomes thickened (Appears more Radioopaque)
- Loss of Joint Space between Articulating Surfaces
- Osteophytes found at the edges of the Articulating Surfaces

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 16.22.17.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_16.22.17.png)

### Inflammatory Changes in OA

1. Bone Lining Cell Hyperplasia
2. Increased Vascularity (Compensatory to try increase delivery of Anti-inflammatory cells to the Bone)
3. Mononuclear Cell Perivascular (Around Vessel) Aggregates (Phagocytose dying Chondrocytes)
4. Subintimal Fibrosis

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 16.22.37.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_16.22.37.png)

# MRI Changes in OA

- Good at showing Bone Marrow Oedema (Whitened, Cloudy patches within the Bone) due to inflammatory processes seen in OA

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 16.25.27.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_16.25.27.png)

---

# Phenotypic Variation in OA

- There seems to be a mismatch/complex relationship between Degree of Sx and Radiological Evidence of OA
- This is as pain is multifactorial, influenced by many different biopsychosocial factors, such as Pain Sensitivity, Joint Damage and Individual Psychosocial Characteristics

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 16.25.59.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_16.25.59.png)

# OA Treatment and Pharmacological Intervention

- Currently no pharmacological treatments which can reverse cartilage thickness or function
- Principal aims:
1. Manage pain - NSAIDs 
2. Improve joint function
3. Patient education – weight loss, exercise (often Aerobic), physiotherapy
4. Surgery – osteotomy, debridement, arthroplasty (partial or total)

### Pharmacological Interventions

- Topical – NSAIDs, capsaicum (one or a few joints only - This cream is topical, reduce systemic absorption)
- Intra-articular glucocorticoids (but only last around four weeks and are reserved for those with Primary or Autoimmune Osteoarthritis (RA) predominantly)
- Hyaluronic acid (aka viscosupplementation) – only small benefit over placebo if any
- Oral NSAIDs – avoid in GI, CV, renal, DM, HTN, advanced age
- Side Effects of Oral NSAIDs can be avoided via the use of COX2 selective drugs (Most NSAIDs block COX1 and COX2) or co-prescribe PPI
- Opioids – efficacious but dangerous
- Glucosamine and chondroitin – not routinely recommended as conflicting data from RCTs

### Current Concepts for OA Treatment

![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 16.29.05.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_16.29.05.png)

- Chronic Pain of OA can be reduced by targeting Central Pain Processing via drugs like Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Duloxetine

---

# Targeted Structural Modification in OA

1. Growth factors
- E.g. FGF-18 currently in trials
1. Strontium ranelate
- Was initially licensed for osteoporosis and inhibits joint space narrowing to a slight extent but is poorly tolerated
1. Anti-nerve growth factor (tanezumab)
- Early trials halted but now restarted, TrkA receptor inhibitors in development
1. Anti-TNF – Surprisingly has no benefit, as OA is likely multifactorial, influenced by multiple cytokines rather than one cytokine driving the process
2. Autologous chondrocyte implantation, works for selected patients only
3. Stem Cells - Mesenchymal-Derived Stem Cells are extracted from bone marrow to differentiate into Chondrocytes.
- These form low quality quality with low durability so is not very useful

---

# Postmenopausal Osteoporosis

# Prevention and Treatment

### Main Therapies

- HRT
- Bisphosphonates
- Tibolone
- SERMs
- Strontium ranelate
- Calcium and vitamin D

### Other Therapies

- Anabolic steroids - Rarely used as can cause CHD and induce Cardiac Failure in Elderly
- Fluoride - Rarely used as whilst it stimulates bone formation, bone is formed with fluoroxyapatite, which is very brittle, increasing fracture risk
- Boron - Very inert so unlikely to be effective
- Nylestriol (very weak Japanese oestrogen with limited support in data)
- Hachimijiogan (Chinese herbal medicine claimed to be effective)

---

# HRT and Fractures

- HRT very effectively reduces fracture risk
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-10-22 at 15.08.05.png](%5B044%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Bone%20and%20Cartilage%20Changes%20Over%20T%206aa02f109bad495bbfee3a7ae2671620/Screenshot_2021-10-22_at_15.08.05.png)
    

### Risks of HRT

1. Breast cancer:
- Inconclusive risk of Breast Cancer following Oestrogen + Progesterone administration in HRT.
- No ↑ in risk of Breast Cancer with Oestrogen alone.
1. Stroke:
- Dose-dependent (Notably if Oral Oestrogen is given in large doses)
- No ↑ in the risk of stroke if HRT initiated < 60 years.
1. Venous thrombo-embolism:
- Dose/route.
- Transient ↑ in risk seen with oral HRT.
- No ↑ in risk seen with transdermal gel/patch of HRT.

---

# Bisphosphonates

- have the ending -dronate
- Stable Pyrophosphate analogues, with Central C and 2 Side-Chains which alter its potency
- Long Lasting Effects, persisting in the skeleton for many years

### Risks

1. GI side-effects - Reduced by giving less frequent doses of the drug (Giving 1x large dose a week vs 7 smaller doses daily)
2. Atrial fibrillation:
- More severe with IV bisphosphonates
1. Osteonecrosis of jaw:
- More common with IV bisphosphonates
- Usually follows dental extraction (likely as Bisphosphonates reduce blood flow to bones, leading to Osteonecrosis)
1. Inflammatory eye disease:
- Only with IV
1. Oesophageal cancer:
- Only with oral bisphosphonates taken >3 years (likely untrue)
1. Femoral stress fractures:
- Occurs with Long term (>5 years) bisphosphonate use and is very rare (1/5000)
- These are spontaneous fractures in the mid-shaft of the femur

---

# Risks of Tibolone

- Synthetic chemical acting like oestrogen, progesterone and androgen.
- Relieves Sx of Menopause but does not provide protection against fractures
- Breast cancer:
- ↓ risk in normal women.
- ↑ risk in breast cancer survivors.
- Stroke:
- Apparent ↑ risk.

---

# Raloxifene (SERMs) and Fractures

- Oral selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM).
- Weak oestrogen-like effects on skeleton.
- ↓ incidence of vertebral fracture, but no effect on hip fracture.
- ↑ VTE risk (Venous Thromboembolism)
- Causes hot flushes in post-menopausal women.

---

# Strontium Ranellate

- No longer safe to use, serious risk of cardiovascular disease.
- ↑ risk of VTE.
- Hypersensitivity reactions

---

# Calcium/Vitamin D Risks

- Limited Fracture protection only in elderly in Vitamin D-deficient women who were institutionalised.
- ↑ renal calculi
- ↑ cardiovascular disease (heavily contested)

---

# Teriparatide

- Recombinant DNA form/Analogue of parathyroid hormone.
- Effective anabolic agent by driving OB Activity to increase bone formation.
- Intermittent use activates osteoblasts more than osteoclasts, leading to ↑ in bone density.

### Risks

1. Bankruptcy: £5,000 for 18-month course (Very expensive)
- No hip fracture data so effects on the risk of hip fractures are unknown
1. Hypersensitivity reactions
2. Hypercalcaemia (likely transient)
3. Hypercortisolism (Very rare)
4. ↑ osteosarcoma risk (Shown in animal but not yet in humans)

---

# Phytoestrogens

- Some may act like weak oestrogens on bone but others do not work at all.
- Different Phytoestrogens have widely different activities.
- There are no RCTs which prove that they are effective in the Rx of Osteoporosis
- Product production needs quality control (as they are produced by plants) so content of Phytoestorogen supplements are unknown.
- Side-effects and safety unknown.

# New Treatment Approaches and Denosumab

1. Target signalling systems to bone cells.
2. Target cellular action of bone cells

### Denosumab

- Inhibits RANK-L, reducing OC activity and hence, bone loss
- Significant ↓ in hip and spine fractures.
- Administered subcutaneously every 6 months.
- Side effects:
1. ↑ muscle pain
2. ↑ cholesterol
3. ↑ infections (RANK-L also used in infections, so as denosumab blocks it, infection more likely).
4. Femoral Shaft fractures and Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (Same as Bisphosphonates as they both inhibit OCs)
- When Px stops taking Denosumab, there is accelerated bone resorption afterwards and hence, increased risk of fractures.

# Sclerostin Inhibitor

### Romosozumab

- Wnt/LRP is a major driver for bone formation in osteoblasts. It has
2 natural inhibitors:
1. Dkk (dickkopf-1)
2. Sclerostin
- Romosozumab is an autoantibody against sclerostin.
- ↑ in markers for bone formation and ↓ markers for bone resorption initially. After 12 months, bone resorption markers increased to match the levels of the Bone Formation markers due to the coupling of OB and OC activity
- It also causes increases in bone density
- It reduces the risk of vertebral fractures but a non-significant reduction in non-vertebral fractures (likely due to small study size)

### Side Effects

- Side effects:
- 1 case osteonecrosis of jaw.
- 1 case atypical fracture
- Increase in the risk of adverse cardiovascular effects

# Other Future Therapies

- New Bisphosphonates
- Oestrogen administered alongside SERM - Shown to be very effective in protecting the womb lining, reducing bleeding whilst not affecting bone effects
- Alternative administration of PTH via Intranasal Spray (instead of daily subcutaneous injection)
- LRP/Wnt Regulatory Pathway (Antibodies to DKK/dickkopf-1, LRP5)

# Conclusion

- HRT remains the treatment of choice for the prevention of Osteoporosis in women

---

# Case Study

- As bone mass is largely genetically determined, genetics play a large role in susceptibility to Osteoporosis

### Ix

- Look for Secondary Causes
- FBC/ESR - To exclude Reticuloendothelial Causes
- Serum Calcium/Phosphate/ALP - Exclude Hypoparathyroidism
- Urine + Electrolytes (Kidney Function) and LFTs - Exclude Overactive Thyroid
- Serum Protein Electrophoresis and Urine Bence-Jones - Used in elderly individuals to Dx Multiple Myeloma
