# [034] Infections of Bone, Joints and Muscle

# Examples of Bacteria Causing Infections

### Osteomyelitis/Bone:

- *Staphylococcus aureus*
- Treatment for MSSA/Methicillin Sensititve Staph Aureus: 2 days intravenous clindamycin then oral clindamycin to day 20
- *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*

### Joint:

- *Staphylococcus aureus*
- *Staphylococcus epidermidis* (prosthetic)
- Various anaerobic bacteria

### Muscle:

- *Streptococcus pyogenes -* Mouth commensal
- *Clostridium perfringens* - Gut Commensal

# Routes of Bone Infection

- Haematogenous osteomyelitis: via circulation/blood stream (most common in children and adults < 25)
- Traumatic osteomyelitis: via wounds, fractures, orthopaedic surgery
- Spread from an adjacent infected joint

---

# Acute Inflammation

- Characterised by:
1. Infiltration by granulocytes
2. ↑ vascular permeability
- Leading to:
1. Calor (heat): ↑ blood flow
2. Dolor (pain): bradykinin cascade
3. Rubor (redness): capillaries become leaky
4. Tumor (swelling): capillaries become leaky

---

# Infections of Joints

- Localisation of Joint Infections is associated with high turnover and ↑ vascularisation during growth especially of long bones (occurs in children and adults up to 25 years of age as their bones are still growing)

# *Staphylococcus aureus* (Coagulase +ve)

- Gram +ve cocci in clusters
- Further tests (other than gram stain) required to identify the specific species of Staphylococcus
- Coagulase positive - They express the enzyme that convert fibrinogen to fibrin
- Causes 75% of osteomyelitis
- Coagulase Negative Staphylocci (E.g Staph epidermidis) are skin commensals that cause most causes of Osteomyelitis associated with Prosthetic Joints

### Symptoms

- Sudden pain
- Swelling and redness of the Skin

### Pathogenesis

1. Sluggish blood flow at the neck of the long bone leads to Bacterial Adhesion, causing acute inflammation at site
2. Location of Bacteria in the bone means it avoids host defences by growing in biofilm, where it grows and is protected from external agents and antibiotics
3. Growth and Activity of the Bacteria leads to necrosis of tissue and abscess formation, with further necrosis occurring due to compromised blood supply

### Virulence

- Coagulase - Main Factor
- Haemolysins - Damage RBCs
- Staphylokinase
- Leucocidins
- Epidermolytic toxins
- Enterotoxins - Expresses by some S.aureus strains, causing food poisoning (Very rapid Onset)
- Toxic shock toxin
- Biofilm production

### Treatment

- Surgery: release any pus immediately and commence chemotherapy
- Chemotherapy:
1. Flucloxacillin and consider also 2 weeks of Flusidic acid or rifampicin
2. Continue treatment for 6-8 weeks

---

# *Staphylococcus epidermidis* (Coagulase -ve)

- Skin commensal
- Causes most cases of osteomyelitis associated with prosthetic joints (causes 10-40% of prosthetic hip infections)

### Virulence

- Biofilm production - Main virulence factor
- Other virulence factors not well-characterised

### Biofilms from Prosthesis and Teeth

- Biofilms are complex, resistant microbial communities
- Antibiotics cannot penetrate the biofilm so sensitive bacteria survive due to the metabolism of resistant or tolerant organisms also found within the Biofilm
- This makes them difficult to treat

---

# *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*

- Chronic inflammation
- Pott’s disease (tuberculosis spondylitis) = Tuberculosis outside of the lungs, seen in vertebrae.
- It is characterised by caseous necrosis and abscess formation, causing disc tissue to die.
- This leads to vertebral narrowing, collapse and fusion, leading to spinal/nerve damage that often presents as paralysis below the site of the lesion (where vertebrae have fused and damaged the nerve).
- Bony changes (Bone formation to stabilise unequal vertebral collapse) are found in only 5% of cases but is Dx of TB
- Fused Vertebrae and evidence of a Chronic/cold abscess (not hot and inflamed) could be caused by TB or Brucellosis (From infected dairy products/goat meat) - Difficult to Dx from observation of Bone Morphology
- Periostitis (new bone formation) is a sign of long term response to infection or most commonly, Cancer such as Lung (historically, most common cause was TB)
- Grandparents Syndrome - Weakened Immune System in elderly causes re-emmergence of Latent Infections like TB, which are then passed onto young children (Grandchildren), who also have weakened immune systems that are still developing

### Treatment

- Chemotherapy: treatment for at least 6 months and possibly up to 9-12 months for extensive bone infections (e.g. rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol (2 months or more) then rifampicin + isoniazid (up to 10 months)
- Rx regime can cause Gastric Side Effects and can be difficult to tolerate
- Surgery: some authorities prefer a combination of antituberculosis chemotherapy and surgical debridement
- Physical care: bed rest and bracing may be useful for spinal TB by adding additional support

# Acute Tissue Infections

### Pathogens

- *Streptococcus pyogenes* (group A strep)
- Mixed infections with facultative and strict anaerobes
- *Clostridium perfringens*

---

# Streptococcus

## *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A Strep)

- Gram +ve
- Slightly bacillus/square shaped and grow in long chains
- Streptococci grow rapidly and so, produce infection and clinical Sx very quickly
- 𝛽-haemolysis (complete lysis of erythrocytes) - Caused by Group A,B,C and G Strep
- Most commensal streptococci show 𝛼-haemolysis (incomplete - produces green discolouration) such as Oral Strep and *Strep pneumoniae*

### Virulence Factors

- M-protein: adhesin, anticomplement protein
- Lipoteichoic acid (cell wall protein): adhesin
- Erythrogenic toxins A, B, D: superantigens (induce non-specific immune response)
- Streptolysin, O, S: haemolysins (O = only present in aerobic environment and S is present in aerobic or anaerobic environment)
- Streptokinase
- DN’ase
- Hyaluronidase
- Proteases (e.g. C5a peptidases

### Superantigens

- Produced by staphylococci, group A streptococci, mycoplasmas (found in lungs commonly)
- Potent immunomodulators
- Cause excessive liberation of cytokines
- Kill T cells and other immune cells
- Divert T cells into polyclonal activation which is immunologically unhelpful

### Presentations

1. Cellulitis
2. Necrotising fasciitis
3. Gangrene

---

# Cellulitis and Necrotising Fasciitis

- Cellulitis: severe and rapidly spreading infection with a focus in sub-dermal fat

### Necrotising Fasciitis

- Deep necrosis of tissue that is rapidly spreading
- It also can cause bullae to appear on the skin (Large blisters that are filled with a clear fluid) superficial to areas of necrosis

### Pathogens

- Streptococcus pyogenes (group A strep)
- Mixed infection with anaerobes
- Rarely other organisms (e.g. E. coli and other g-ve rods) with a combination of host susceptibility and microbial virulence factors

### Symptoms

- Acute inflammatory response
- Extremely painful
- Erythema spreads rapidly
- Patient is ‘toxic’

### Pathogenesis

1. Bacteria penetrate the tissue and adhere to the tissue surface
2. Here, they avoid the host immune response and produce enzymes/toxins to destroy tissue
3. They causes thrombosis of perforating arteries, leading to necrosis and non-specific activation of immune cells (notably in infections with Streptococci via Superantigens) so that the immune response is non-specific/not targeted to the infective bacteria

### Treatment

- Strep infection/Cellulitis: benzylpenicillin (BP)
- Necrotising fasciitis:
1. Radical excision/removal of all necrotic tissue
2. Local and systemic antibiotics: clindamycin (acts on ribosomes and toxin production) + BP (use vancomycin or linezolid if MRSA - not very well tolerated)

---

# Gas Gangrene

- Medical Emergency

### Pathogens

1. Clostridium perfringens
- Gram +ve rods which are very common (mainly found in the Gut) but can appear Gram -ve after they die
- They can produce endospores but this rarely happens in clinical samples (It is more common in other Clostridia)
- They have a very tough cell wall, allowing the bacteria to persist for a long time in the environment
- It is unique to other clostridia as it produces acid and gas by fermentation of carbohydrates (produced foul smell)
- Other clostridia break down proteins rather than carbohydrates (Clostridia are mainly found in the environment/outside)
1. Mixed facultative and strict anaerobes

### Virulence Factors

- Exotoxin (17 different ones) - Released from the bacteria and subsequently found deposited in the tissue
- 𝛼-toxin (phospholipase C): causes human cell lysis

### Symptoms

- Dark red skin with large bullae
- Very painful
- Erythema spreads
- Patient is ‘toxic’
- Very little inflammation

### Pathogenesis

1. The Anaerobic organisms enters the tissue where oxygen tension is low (due to impaired blood supply) and grow here
2. It then produces hydrolytic enzymes, causing tissue destruction, allowing the continual spread of organism into the destroyed tissue cavity, producing necrosis via exotoxins as it moves 
- C.perfringens ferments carbohydrates to produce Acid and Gas, which is present in tissues and palpable and visualised in radiographs

### Treatment

- Surgery: immediately, all affected tissue must be removed.
- May need amputation (can therefore be fatal if it enters tissue above the hips) if Gas Gangrene is widespread
- Benzylpenicillin (BP) is adjunct therapy, not an alternative to surgery as it is the toxins that cause the Necrosis Gas Gangrene, not the Bacteria itself

# Source of Inflammatory Mediators

1. Invading microorganism: lipopolysaccharide/LPS can be found in the peptidoglycan cell wall of gram –ve bacteria - This can trigger a inflammatory response
2. Resident cells:
- TNF, IL-1: macrophages, fibroblasts
- IL-8: epithelial cells
- Histamine: mast cells
- NAD dehydrogenase: mitochondria
- Leucotrienes, prostaglandins: all cells
1. Acute phase proteins: mannose binding lectin (MBL), complement
