# [016] Skeletal Muscle CAL

# Skeletal Muscle TS and LS

- The tongue is the only organ that contains intermingling bundle of striated muscle running perpendicular to one another (Skeletal Muscle in one section can be seen in TS and LS)
- Cross-Striation/Banding Pattern can only be seen in Skeletal Muscle in LS
- Skeletal Muscle Nuclei are much more rounded than Smooth Muscle nuclei

# Skeletal Muscle Inserting into a Tendon

- Skeletal Muscle nuclei tend to be found along the length of the Muscle Fibre, not close to the ends of the cell (where the Fibres become tendinous)
- There is an abrupt junction between the Muscle and the Tendon, marked by a change in orientation of the fibres and the transition between thick diameter/coarse muscle fibres and the Tendon with fine CT Fibres (not visible)
- There is also a distinct change in nuclei from relatively rounded to fusiform/spindle shaped
- There are lots of fibroblasts in this junctional region, making the transition zone between the Muscle and Tendon appear highly cellular/granular (lots of nuclei)

# Motor End Plate

- This is where axonal bundles end after branching off the main nerve trunk
- The nerve terminal resembles a bunch of grapes with each 'grape'/rounded end of the Axon being called a Terminal Bouton
- Motor End Plate + Specialised area of Sarcolemma opposite the nerve terminal = NMJ
- Trailing Endings (TE) of nerves can be seen contacting a very narrow muscle cell (likely to be a Muscle Spindle)
- Near the NMJ, there is a large vascular tree in order to supply $O_2$ and nutrients for the contracting muscles

# Muscle Spindle

- These are modified striated muscle fibres, much narrower than normal fibres (and more translucent), innervated by sensory as well as motor nerves
- The Sensory Nerve Terminal is found within the expanded/widened central region and the Motor Nerve Terminal has a diffuse end plate found on the Tapered distal ends

### Muscle Spindle (High Spindle)

- Muscle Spindle has a diameter about one quarter of that of a Skeletal Muscle Fibre
- Motor End Plates on Muscle Spindle are much smaller than those on Skeletal Muscle Fibres, with fewer Terminal Boutons
- Terminal Boutons/MEPs can also be found along the entire central length of the Muscle Spindle (most concentrated centrally) vs only at discrete regions along the Skeletal Muscle Fibre
- Muscle Spindles are contractile to a minor extent, with Birefringence of these Contractile Proteins being evident (Central Opaque protein running down length of Spindle and Other Translucent Proteins)

# Skeletal Muscle

- Neighbouring Muscle Fibres are not directly connected to one another but are bound together by the Perimysium
- At low resolution, artefactual spaces are often filled with Perimysium
- Fascicles are often variable is size and shape
- The Endomysium contains reticular fibres (Type III Collagen) and Type I Collagen
- The reticular fibres form a 3D Scaffolding, providing mechanical support for the individual muscle fibres
- These fibres also surround adipocytes found within the muscle and capillaries within the CT of the muscle

# Anal Sphincters

- Internal Anal Sphincter is made of Smooth Muscle (Under ANS control)
- External Anal Sphincter Surrounds IAS and is made of Skeletal Muscle (Under Somatic Control)
- The IAS is the distal thickening of the Inner Circular Layer of Muscularis Externa of the Sigmoid Colon
