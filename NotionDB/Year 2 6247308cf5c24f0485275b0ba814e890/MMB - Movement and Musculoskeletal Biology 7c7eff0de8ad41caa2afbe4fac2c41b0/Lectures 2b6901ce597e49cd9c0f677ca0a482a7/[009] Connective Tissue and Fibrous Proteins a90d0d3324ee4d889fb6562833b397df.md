# [009] Connective Tissue and Fibrous Proteins

# Cell Types and ECM

There are 5 primary tissue types:

1. Epithelial Tissue
2. Connective tissue
3. Muscular tissue
4. Nervous tissue
5. Blood

There are 3 types of molecules that are abundant in the ECM of all tissues

1. Proteoglycans (glycosaminoglycans stuck onto a core protein forming bottle-brush structure)
2. Collagens
3. Multiadhesive matrix proteins

### Extracellular Matrix

- Multiadhesive proteins are long multiple-domain proteins that connect Collagen fibres to the Cell Surface Receptors on the Cell Membrane
- Proteoglycan is found buried inside the ECM as a Matrix Proteoglycan Core Protein with Cell Surface Proteoglycan Core Proteins being found in the Cell Membrane, containing tails that extend into the ECM
- Cell-Cell Adhesion Proteins found in the Cell Membranes of adjacent cells dimerise in the Extracellular Space between the Cells to anchor the two cells to one another

# Properties and Functions of Fibrous Proteins

- Make up 50% of protein body content, with 25% of this content coming from Globular and Fibrous proteins respectively
- 4 Main Properties of Fibrous Proteins =
1. Extended protein structure
2. Insoluble in water (or in the lipid bilayer if it is a membrane protein)
3. Secondary structure is simple and based on one type (ùõº helix or ùõΩ sheet)
4. Quaternary structure is held together by covalent bridges but varies across different fibrous proteins

Their main functions are related to establishing and maintaining body structure:

- ùú∂-keratin: external protection/toughness of the outer layer of the body (hair, nails, outer skin)
- Elastin: In connective tissues. Relates to elasticity, allowing movement to occur without compromising structure (ligaments, lung walls, aorta)
- Collagen: In connective tissues. Relates to tensile strength (tendons, bones)

---

# Œ±-Keratin

- Found in hair, nails, outer layer of skin, forming almost the entire dry weight of these structures
- Produced by epidermal cells

### Protein Structure

- The Entire secondary structure of Œ±-Keratin is an ùõº-helix (2 helices that twist/spiral around each other)

### Primary Structure

- It is rich in AAs that favour ùõº-helix formation (Phe, Ile, Val, Met, Ala)
- These hydrophobic side-chains are on the outer surface of the ùõº-helix, making in insoluble
- It is rich in Cys residues, forming disulphide bridges between Cys in separate ùõº-helices to connect them together along the length of the spiral. This increases the strength of Œ±-Keratin.

### Secondary Structure

- It is constructed from 2 supercoiled ùõº-helices, twisted/spiralling around each other

![Screenshot 2021-09-08 at 18.40.01.png](%5B009%5D%20Connective%20Tissue%20and%20Fibrous%20Proteins%20a90d0d3324ee4d889fb6562833b397df/Screenshot_2021-09-08_at_18.40.01.png)

### Tertiary Structure

- Disulphide bridges occur along the length of ùõº-keratin between the free -SH of Cys to stabilise the double helix of Œ±-Keratin
- These normally/frequently stabilise the interior of a globular protein.
- There are different forms of Œ±-Keratin within the body, with varying numbers of disulphide bridges.
- The more disulphide bridges are found within a molecule of ùõº-keratin, the stronger it is. These are critical to the strength of Œ±-Keratin
- There seems to be a correlation in the risk of Osteoporosis development and low levels of Disulphide Bridges in Œ±-Keratin found in fingernails

### Supersecondary Structure

- The association of long, parallel Œ±-helices via disulphide bridges gives Œ±-Keratin its toughness.
- 2 parallel ùõº-helices supercoil around each other to form a dimer.
- Each dimer then associates with 2 other antiparallel dimers (alternating C and N termini found moving down the protofibril) in a staggered arrangement to form the protofibril.
- The association of 4 protofibrils forms a 4-stranded rope.
- It is the successive overlaps of Œ±-Keratin fibres within this arrangement that lead to toughness

# Elastin

- Major component of elastic fibres (as it can stretch several times, then return to original size)
- Found in blood vessel walls (aorta), elastic ligaments, lung walls - Any tissues that need to stretch and recoil
- Made by fibroblasts and chondrocytes
- Damage/degradation of elastin causing structures to stiffer, as is seen in cardiovascular disease and lung emphysema

### Formation

- It is synthesised as proelastin
- Converted to tropoelastin (mol wt. 72,000)
- Crosslinking to tropoelastin via lysine residues forms elastin

Number of Lys residues involved in cross-linking determines the product formed (no need to learn specific structures, just know reactions):

- **Desmosine**: formed from 4 Lys residues arranged in a square, 3 of which are oxidised to form an aldehyde (Allysine).
- The Aldehyde and Amine groups of the 4 lysines then react together to form a central 6-membered ring with alternating single-double bonds

![Screenshot 2021-10-04 at 13.48.46.png](%5B009%5D%20Connective%20Tissue%20and%20Fibrous%20Proteins%20a90d0d3324ee4d889fb6562833b397df/Screenshot_2021-10-04_at_13.48.46.png)

- **Lysinonorleucine**: 2 parallel Lys residues are cross-linked by oxidation, catalysed by lysyl oxidase to form lysinonorleucine.
- 1 lysine is oxidised to form an aldehyde (Allysine - Catalysed by Lysyl Oxidase) and other is not to initially combine (Aldehyde and Amine undergo condensation reaction) to form a Schiff base as an intermediate.
- The Schiff Base is unstable, and is reduced to form lysinonorleucine.

![Screenshot 2021-09-09 at 11.20.57.png](%5B009%5D%20Connective%20Tissue%20and%20Fibrous%20Proteins%20a90d0d3324ee4d889fb6562833b397df/Screenshot_2021-09-09_at_11.20.57.png)

- If both lysines are oxidised, an aldol link will form between both aldehyde-lysines (Allysines) instead

### Amino Acid Composition

- 33% Gly, 10% Pro and Hyp, 23% Ala, 13% Val: 79% of these resides come from 4 amino acids
- It contains large hydrophobic peptides that are rich in Ala, Val, Ile and Leu
- As these sidechains do not interact with each other by hydrogen bonds due to their hydrophobicity, their hydrophobic role appears to make Elastin fibres loosely adherent to one another within the core of elastin, allowing the elastin network to easily deform
- The elastin network is held together by the disulphide bonds but is able to stretch due to the hydrophobic AAs within Elastin that are weakly bonded to one another

### Secondary Structure

- A different type of helix structure from those in alpha-helix or collagen triple helix. This can stretch and relax
- Constructed from helices of ùõΩ-turns, based on the sequence Val.Pro.Gly.Val and is called the ùõΩ-spiral

![Screenshot 2021-09-09 at 11.21.24.png](%5B009%5D%20Connective%20Tissue%20and%20Fibrous%20Proteins%20a90d0d3324ee4d889fb6562833b397df/Screenshot_2021-09-09_at_11.21.24.png)

# Collagen

- Most abundant protein in body (25% of body protein)
- Found in connective tissue where tensile strength needed (tendon, inner skin (72% collagen), cartilage (50% collagen), bones, cornea (68% collagen)
- 30 different polypeptide chains are found within the collagens. Various combinations of these give rise to 16 different types of collagen (type 1 collagen in skin, bone and tendons =  triple helix formed by 2 x ùõº1 and 1 x ùõº2.)
- Synthesised by fibroblasts and chondrocytes

# 4 Stages of Collagen Assembly

### 1) Synthesis as Procollagen which is then secreted by the cell

- 3 separate pro-ùõº chains synthesised separately within cell. These have a long central Triple Helix with looser N and C-Terminal Peptides at each end
- Selected Pro and Lys residues hydroxylated to form Hyp (hydroproline) and Hyl (hydroxylysine).
- Selected Hyl resides are glycosylated
- 3 pro-ùõº chains assemble/join togehter at C-terminus end, with the formation of disulphide bridge between the 3 chains here.
- The 3 chains then ‚Äòzip‚Äô up (wind around each other), with more disulphide bridges forming between the 3 chains at the N-terminus, forming procollagen.
- Whilst proteins generally fold into their Tertiary Structure moving from the N to C Terminus, Collagen is the only protein that folds from the C to the N terminus
- A typical collagen sequence has 900 residues, with a Gly residue at every third position. And frequent Pro and Hyp residues. Sequence ‚âà (Pro.Hyp.Gly)‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ (Related: osteogenesis imperfecta - when the Gly is not in the correct position)

![Screenshot 2021-09-09 at 11.21.56.png](%5B009%5D%20Connective%20Tissue%20and%20Fibrous%20Proteins%20a90d0d3324ee4d889fb6562833b397df/Screenshot_2021-09-09_at_11.21.56.png)

### 2) Cleavage of Procollagen to Tropocollagen by Procollagen Peptidase outside the cell

- Procollagen peptidase cleaves the N and C-terminal peptides of procollagen from the central triple helix to form tropocollagen (Procollagen without the C and N Termini). (Related: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)
- Secondary structure of tropocollagen is triple helix with 35% Gly, 21% Pro/ Hyp and 12% Ala and 32% for other AAs
- The triple helix structure is highly extended and characterises all the collagen types
- Tropocollagen length 300 nm (one of the most elongated proteins)

![Screenshot 2021-09-09 at 11.28.28.png](%5B009%5D%20Connective%20Tissue%20and%20Fibrous%20Proteins%20a90d0d3324ee4d889fb6562833b397df/Screenshot_2021-09-09_at_11.28.28.png)

Features of Triple Helix:

- 3 separate polypeptide chains arranged as left-handed helix (note ùõº-helix is right handed)
- 3.3 residues per turn
- Each chain forms H-bonds with the other 2 chains
- Gly residues essential at every 3rd position:
- Gly R group is only H (very small) which faces towards the centre of the triple helix, enabling the close packing of polypeptide chains within the Triple Helix
- The proton in the NH of the main chain Gly forms key H bond to the oxygen in the CO of adjacent polypeptides)
- Pro and Hyp resides are ‚Äòamino acids‚Äô. The 5C ring sidechains of these amino acids form covalent link with main chain N atom. This ring structure stiffens triple helix
- Gly residues buried in the middle of the Triple Helix while other 19 amino acids (including Pro and Hyp) are on the outside surface of the triple helix.
- These AAs on the outside of the helix form inter-triple helix contacts to stabilise the collagen fibre

![Screenshot 2021-08-29 at 19.45.10.png](%5B009%5D%20Connective%20Tissue%20and%20Fibrous%20Proteins%20a90d0d3324ee4d889fb6562833b397df/Screenshot_2021-08-29_at_19.45.10.png)

### 3) Assembly of Tropocollagen leads to Collagen Fibre

- EM of collagen fibre shows periodic cross-striations of dark and light bands, with a repeat every 67 nm.
- Dark Band = 300nm long (Length of Tropocollagen, with significant overlap of Triple Helices as the entire length of the Helices overlap) and Light Band = 67 nm long (Contains gaps between Adjacent Tropocollagen Fibres, with less overlap as only the ends of the Helices overlap)
- This is due to the formation of ¬º staggered array of tropocollagen molecules (each displaced lengthwise/along the length of the collagen fibre by a ¬º of its length)
- There are 40 nm gaps between the ends of tropocollagen molecules, where calcium phosphate is deposited to form bone
- This assembly/arrangement forms spontaneously by noncovalent H-bond interactions involving OH group of hydroxyproline (Related: scurvy)
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-08-29 at 19.48.12.png](%5B009%5D%20Connective%20Tissue%20and%20Fibrous%20Proteins%20a90d0d3324ee4d889fb6562833b397df/Screenshot_2021-08-29_at_19.48.12.png)
    
- An experiment showed that a synthetic collagen polymer made of Pro.Pro.Gly repeats forms a triple helix with a melting/unfolding temperature of 24¬∞ùê∂, which is below body temperature of 37¬∞C.
- Changing the second amino acid, so it contains Pro.Hyp.Gly repeats ‚Üë melting temperature to 58¬∞C
- The OH Group of the Hydroxyproline ring is crucial for the assembly of Collagen. Its absence leads to Scurvy
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-09-09 at 13.04.18.png](%5B009%5D%20Connective%20Tissue%20and%20Fibrous%20Proteins%20a90d0d3324ee4d889fb6562833b397df/Screenshot_2021-09-09_at_13.04.18.png)
    

### 4) Chemical Crosslinking of Tropocollagen Strengthens Fibre: (Related: Lathyrism)

- Collagen fibre is stabilised by covalent crosslinks, formed between Lys residues (Same as in Elastin)
- As for elastin, action of lysyl oxidase generates aldehyde form (CHO) of Lys (lysine) from Lys residue
- Joining CHO and NH‚ÇÇ on 2 adjacent Lys residues leads to lysinonorleucine
- Joining 2 CHO groups on 2 Lys Aldehydes leads to aldol link

# Collagen Defects and Disease

### Osteogenesis Imperfecta - Defect in 1st Stage of Collagen Assembly

- Genetic defect in the Collagen gene, causing the buried Gly residue (Located near N Terminus) to be mutated to Cys
- Cys is larger than Gly and so, the Triple helix is looser/less tightly packed and so partially unfolds at N-terminal end
- Tropocollagen subunits cannot associate in their regular packing arrangement, causing the collagen fibre to become weaker
- Clinical symptom: brittle bones, patient has skeletal deformities as a result of Brittle Bones

### Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (Type VII) - Defect in 2nd Stage of Collagen Assembly

- ‚Üì levels of procollagen peptidase, so procollagen is not fully converted into tropocollagen
- This causes high level of procollagen found in skin and tendons (Can be used to Dx Type VII EDS)
- The 40 nm gaps between tropocollagen molecules become blocked by uncleaved peptides that remain attached to the Tropocollagen.
- This prevents lysyl oxidase from entering the Collagen Triple Helix and acting on tropocollagen to form crosslinks
- Clinical symptoms: stretchy skin, hypermobile joints, short stature

### Scurvy - Defect in 3rd Stage of Collagen Assembly

- Famous/Common disease of Medieval Europe and the Royal Navy (Instances of Poor Diet)
- Hydroxyproline is important for the correct assembly of Collagen Fibres and is only formed from Pro residues are Procollagen has formed
- Hydroxyproline formation from Pro residues after procollagen has formed requires vitamin C (ascorbate) as a cofactor and is catalysed by Prolyl Hydroxylase
- Lack of vitamin C (often due to diet lacking fresh fruit) leads to poor collagen fibril formation
- Clinical symptoms: skin lesions develop; blood vessel walls are fragile (leading to regular bleeding/haemorrhage and ecchymoses), teeth falling out, lethargy/lack of energy

![Screenshot 2021-09-09 at 13.18.06.png](%5B009%5D%20Connective%20Tissue%20and%20Fibrous%20Proteins%20a90d0d3324ee4d889fb6562833b397df/Screenshot_2021-09-09_at_13.18.06.png)

### Lathyrism - Defect in Final Stage of Collagen Assembly

- In UK: animal disease (not human) caused by ingestion of sweet pea seeds (with ùõΩ-aminopropionitrile) or copper deficiency or low levels of lysyl oxidase (another form of Ehlers Danlos Syndromes)
- Typically only Human Disease in 3rd World Countries (E.g Afghanistan or Pakistan) where crops are commonly poisoned with ùõΩ-aminopropionitrile
- ùõΩ- aminopropionitrile prevents conversion of Lys to its aldehyde form by irreversibly inhibiting lysyl oxidase
- Lysyl oxidase requires copper as a cofactor for full activity (sourced in the diet - Hence, a balanced diet is important for cattle and sheep)
- Lack of cross-link formation in collagen causes lathyrism
- Clinical symptoms: patients experience agonising pain in the calf muscles especially at night. Acute muscle spasms produce painful lumps known as ‚Äòlodokas‚Äô which last for 10-15 minutes and pass off with massage or spontaneously
