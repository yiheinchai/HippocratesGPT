# Iliopsoas

Action: Flex the Hip (Important Flexor)
Extra Info: - Psoas Major and Iliacus have separate origins and innervations but combine to form Iliopsoas, with a single tendon upon insertion                                           - They cross the Hip Joint so they act on the Hip                                   - If there is femoral neck fracture, Psoas Major will pull the Femur towards the body and Laterally rotate it
Innervation: Psoas Major - Anterior/Ventral Rami of L1-L3 but predominantly L1 and L2                                      Iliacus - Femoral Nerve (L2 and L3 but predominantly L2)
Insertion: Lesser Trochanter of the Femur
Origin: Psoas Major - Vertebral Bodies of T12-L5                                        Iliacus - Iliac Fossa (Inside of Iliac Crest)
