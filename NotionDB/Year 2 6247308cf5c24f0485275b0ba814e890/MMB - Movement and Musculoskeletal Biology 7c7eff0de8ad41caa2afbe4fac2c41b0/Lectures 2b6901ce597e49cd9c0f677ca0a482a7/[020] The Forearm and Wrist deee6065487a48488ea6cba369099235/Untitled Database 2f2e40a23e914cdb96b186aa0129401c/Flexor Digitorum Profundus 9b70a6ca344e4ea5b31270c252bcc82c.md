# Flexor Digitorum Profundus

Action: 1) Flex the Wrist                               2) Flex the joints between the Metacarpals and Proximal Phalanges (Metacarpophalangeal Joints)                                            3) Flex the Proximal and Distal Interphalangeal Joints (II-V)
Extra Info: - Like flexor digitorum superficialis, it also forms four tendons that all go through the Carpal Tunnel to insert onto the bases of distal phalanges of digits II-V                                                      - Only flexor digitorum profundus can flex the distal interphalangeal joints
Innervation: Lateral Half = Median Nerve (C7 and C8, but predominantly C8)                 Medial Half = Ulnar Nerve (C8 and T1, but predominantly C8)
Insertion: Bases of the Distal Phalanges of Digits II-V
Origin: 1) Anterior Surface of the Ulna                                     2) Interosseus Membrane
