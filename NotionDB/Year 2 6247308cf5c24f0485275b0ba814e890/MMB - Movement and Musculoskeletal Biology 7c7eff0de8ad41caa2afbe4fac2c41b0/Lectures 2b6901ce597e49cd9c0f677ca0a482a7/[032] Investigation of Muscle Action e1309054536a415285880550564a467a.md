# [032] Investigation of Muscle Action

# Pre-Lab Work

- Motor Unit Action Potential = Sum of all the action potentials generated upon the stimulation of a single motor neuron/motor unit
- The shape of the motor unit potential generated by Surface Electromyography/EMG is determined by the composition of the motor unit, the number of muscle fibres per motor unit, metabolic type of muscle fibres in the motor unit
- Small motor neurons have a smaller surface area and fewer parallel ion channels, meaning it has a higher resistance than large motor neurons. This means that if both sizes of Motor Units receive the same synaptic current, the smaller neuron produces a larger Excitatory Post Synaptic Potential (ESPS) and will therefore be activated before the larger neuron
- Whilst smaller motor units are recruited before larger ones, larger diameter axons (usually sensory) will depolarise first due to external stimulation.
- This is because as diameter increases, internal resistance decreases so current flows easier and more rapidly,
- Also, larger axons have more ion channels per unit length of the neuron to conduct the current, making the larger axons easier to depolarise due to a lower excitation threshold
- Orthodromic Transmission = Signals are transmitted from the dendrites to the axon terminal in the appropriate/correct direction
- Antidromic Transmission = Signals transmitted from axon terminal to the dendrites in the wrong/opposite direction
- H Reflex = Electrical stimulation of Sensory 1a afferents (Same Arc as Muscle Stretch Reflex) in the Tibial Nerve in the Popliteal Fossa to cause contraction of the Soleus (which is detectable by EMG)

# EMG

- Soleus is a muscle with power and postural functions but it is mainly a postural muscle as on an EMG it is active during inactivity/when standing and shows bursts of activity during movements
- It consists of Type I and Type II Fibres which are responsible for its Postural and Power roles respectively

# Conduction Velocity

- Discrepancies between Theoretical and Recorded (via Tendon Tap Reflex) Conduction Velocities for specific nerves are due to:
1. Time between initiation of muscle stretch and stimulation of muscle spindle
2. Resting tension and hence, sensitivity of Muscle Spindle (Determined by magnitude of gamma motor neuron signalling)
3. Location of Muscle Spindle in the recording area
4. Synaptic Transmission within the reflex

# H-Reflex

- Direct stimulation of the 1a afferent vs stimulation of muscle spindle via muscle stretch ensures a defined point/origin of the stimulation, allowing for the exact knowledge of conduction distance and hence, allowing for an accurate calculation of conduction velocity
- Latency of H Reflex is less than that of Tendon Jerk reflex as AP only has to travel from Popliteal Fossa, down Tibial Nerve into the Spinal Cord vs from Muscle Spindles into the Spinal Cord
- With external stimulation, large axons are excited more easily (have a lower threshold potential) than small axons as large axons have a lower internal resistance
- At low intensity signalling, only large diameter sensory afferents are stimulated, causing orthodromic transmission down the 1a afferent and motor neurons simultaneously, producing a single signal (M Response)
- At medium intensity signalling, sensory afferents and some slightly smaller diameter motor neurons are stimulated, causing orthodromic and antidromic signal transmission down the motor neurons.
- The antidromic signal down the motor neuron collides with and cancels out/blocks the orthodromic signal coming down the 1a afferent
- The orthodromic signal down the motor neuron arrives at the muscle before the orthodromic signal down the 1a afferent and the non-stimulated motor neuron, producing 2 separate signals
- At high intensity signalling, all motor neurons are stimulated alongside sensory neurons.
- This causes simultaneous collision between orthodromic signals down 1a afferents and antidromic signals down motor neurons, cancelling out these signals whilst causing the simultaneous arrival of orthodromic signals from motor neurons to the muscle, producing one signal

- M Response peaks at sub-maximal/very low H-Reflex intensity and decreases as H-Reflex intensity increases

# Q&A - New

- THEY EXAMINE NEURO STUFF IN MMB A LOT (NEUROPHYSIOLOGY)
- EMG allows for accurate recording of the time between Nerve Stimulation and Muscle Depolarisation, allowing accurate determination of Conduction Velocity
- When a motor neuron fires, it will cause all the muscle fibres of the motor unit to contract to produce a single twitch
- H Reflex = Stimulation of 1a afferents (as they are largest diameter), initiating a monosynaptic reflex (seen as the H Wave)
- Increasing the stimulus strength, begins to activate motor fibres, which activates muscle directly (no reflex) and at a shorter latency than the H Reflex as the M wave only has to travel towards the muscle vs towards the spinal cord and then back to the muscle (M Wave)
- As the stimulus strength increases, the M Wave predominates over the H Wave as Antidromic Effects from Motor Neuron activation cancels the H Reflex Orthodromic Drive through Motor Fibres
- Antidromic and Orthodromic Signalling only occurs when a neuron is stimulated part way along the length of its axon
- H wave is produced before M Wave as 1a afferents are larger than Motor Neurons and hence, are stimulated first (at lower intensities)
