# [030] Bone and Soft Tissue Tumours

# Metaplasia, Dysplasia and Neoplasia

### Metaplasia - Change in Form

- Reversible change in which one mature cell type is replaced by another type of mature cell
- E.g Lower Oesophagus and Cervix where there is a Squamo-Columnar Junction where  Squamous Metaplasia occurs
- In the cervix at the squamo-columnar junction, columnar epithelium becomes squamous
- In the Lower Oesophagus, Squamous Epithelia of the Oesophagus becomes lined with Columnar Mucosa (Barrett's Oesophagus - Caused by Acid Reflux)
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Lung = Most Common Lung Cancer. Irritation of the URT causes stem cells to transdifferentiate and undergo metaplastic changes to become squamous, which in turn become dysplastic and neoplastic
- It is an adaptive substitution of cells
- Metaplasia does not occur due to the redifferentiation of already differentiated cells.
- Instead, already differentiated cells remain the same and there is reprogramming of stem cells (Transdifferentiation) to differentiate differently to form the metaplastic epithelia
- Alternatively, mature cells can migrate across a squamo-columnar junction to occupy territory in which they wouldn't normally be found
- Lung cancer: columnar cells become squamous

### Dysplasia - Disordered Growth

- Commonly found in areas of Metaplastic Tissue (E.g Cervix and Barrett's Oesophagus)
- Formation of morphologically atypical/abnormal cells due to mild abnormal differentiation of cells (not as extreme as neoplasia)
- Usually, the dysplastic cells appears more primitive/undifferentiated - Larger nucleus, less differentiated cytoplasm, more mitotically active and has a less-ordered architecture
- Loss of uniformity in population of cells and disorder of their normal architecture
- Low-grade changes may be reversible
- High-grade dysplasia is premalignant (Usually equivalent to Carcinoma In Situ)

### Neoplasia - New Growth

- Acquired abnormality in which there is abnormal, uncoordinated and excessive cell growth which persists after initiating stimulus has been removed (growth may slow after stimulus removed but won’t cure it - Autonomous) and which involves genetic alterations in neoplastic cells
- It must be acquired and is never congenital
- Not necessarily malignant
- Tumour morphology is used for Tumour Diagnosis, with Genetic Abnormalities not being a primary identifier of a tumour but a secondary identifier that produces the specific tumour morphology

# Classification of Neoplasia

[Classification](%5B030%5D%20Bone%20and%20Soft%20Tissue%20Tumours%202a5772101e624f62943ecacbeab84542/Classification%20e1c01fcbed7140c5a650e10a8765dbcc.md)

- Larger tumours are more likely to be Benign
- Malignant Tumour is not derived from mature cells but is derived from stem/precursor cells

---

# Histological Features of Malignancy

- Anisonucleosis: variable in size and shape of nucleus
- ↑ nuclear size (with ↑ nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio as rapid mitotic rate means there is less time to synthesise cytoplasm)
- Lack of differentiation (anaplasia) - Do not resemble normal cells
- ↑ nuclear DNA content with subsequent dark staining on H and E slides (hyperchromatism - appear dark blue/purple) - This is due to regular division of the nuclei meaning the nuclei remains compacted
- Prominent nucleoli or irregular chromatin distribution within nuclei as regular division of nuclei means the nuclei remain compacted
- Some cells may be multinucleated where they have a high mitotic rate but have not yet undergone cytokinesis
- Mitoses AKA Cells in Mitosis (especially irregular or bizarre mitoses) - By itself, it is not indicative of Malignancy

# Spread and Differentiation of Tumours

### Differentiation

- Extent to which neoplastic cells resemble the morphological features of comparable normal cells
- Simple way to do this is If you can't tell whether a tumour is malignant or not, it is well differentiated and if you can't tell what type of tumour a tumour is, it is poorly differentiated - This is the Grade of the Tumour
- High Grade = Poorly Differentiated tumour that will soon metastasise
- Low Grade - Well-differentiated cells resemble tissue of origin
- Anaplasia: lack of differentiation

# Role of Histopathology

- Predictive: to see which biopsied tumours will metastasise
- Base of evidence-based pathology
- Gold standard for diagnosis, but not required if clinical/macroscopic diagnosis is feasible
- The Multistep nature of the development of Malignancy means that subtle changes in Premalignant cells can be identified and interventions can be selected to attempt to interrupt the development of Malignancy

# Examples of Connective Tissue Disorders

### 1. Uterine Fibroid (Leiomyoma)

- World’s most common tumour
- They have a well-defined margin and hence, can be easily resected
- Cells are recognisably smooth muscle cells (well-differentiate) with uniform nuclei, low nuclei:cytoplasm (lots of cytoplasm) and no mitoses
- Cells of Uterine Fibroid are less organised than those of the Uterine Smooth Muscle
- Individual cells are identical to one another (homogenous), with no necrosis

### 2. Giant Cell Tumour of Bone

- Benign tumour that erodes bone by compressing it
- Identified radiologically by a discrete region of eroded bone (appears less radioopaque), with defined margins
- Contains Giant Multinucleate cells that resemble Osteoclasts
- Although giant cells are multinucleated, nuclei are regular, and nucleoli are not a feature

### 3. Chondrosarcoma

- They are usually found at the end of long bones and invade through the periosteum and Bone Cortex to erode the bone
- It has a heterogenous appearance, containing localised regions of haemorrhage
- It is Rx by Ampuation
- Chondrocytes also have very dark, large nuclei

### 4. Osteosarcoma

- Commonest primary malignant tumour of bone
- Most common sites = Knee → Hip → Proximal Humerus → Chin Aspect of Skull
- Only 100-120 new cases in UK each year (in contrast to more common carcinomas (lung, breast, bowel, prostate, cervix))
- It has a poor prognosis, killing 50% of Px within 5 years of Dx
- Bimodal Age of Distribution, being most common in young adults and elderly individual (Latter due to Paget's Disease)
- Paget's Disease - Bone Hypertrophies and thickens, increasing its density and deforming the long bones
- Can be Dx radiographically as tumour lifts up the periosteum, giving Codman's Triangle (Triangle between Bone and Periosteum) and where the tumour invades the bone, it ossifies to form bone spicules (resemble 'hair on end' or 'sun in splendorr')
- In Osteosarcoma, Osteocytes are not localised to their lacunae and are found widespread throughout the Bone

- Pink osteoid material between bone is pathognomonic of osteosarcoma
- Nuclei may also appear pleomorphic, with prominent nuclei and atypical mitoses

- Histologically, Trabecular Elements appear thickened but lack a Lamellar Structure, making them weaker and more prone to fractures (Lots of Tidelines in the Trabecular Elements)

# Malignancy of Bone

- Commonest malignancy in bone is secondary carcinoma
- If tumours are present in multiples of more than 3 in the bone, most likely Dx is Secondary Carcinoma
- Common sites of primary tumours:
