# [012] Autoimmune Disease and the Musculoskeletal System

# Tolerance and Autoimmunity

- Ag = All substances that can be recognised by the immune system via BCRs or TCRs, Immunogens are a specific subset of these Ag that are capable of producing immune responses
- Two fundamental features of the adaptive immune system are memory and specificity
- Specificity is provided by the TCRs and BCRs, with B Cells differentiating into plasma cells upon activation, secreting their BCR in a soluble form (Ab)
- Memory is provided by the Clonal Expansion of T and B Cells upon Ag recognition.
- As there is now a larger pool of T and B Cells specific to the Ag, upon secondary exposure, there will be a more rapid and pronounced response, resulting in milder and shorter lasting Sx
- TCR recognises proteins that have been processed into linear peptides and have been presented in a p-MHC complex
- BCR recognises any molecule in its native/unprocessed conformation (conformational Ag).
- TCRs recognise MHC Restricted Ags that must be presented in complex with MHC whereas BCRs are non-MHC Restricted and can recognise Ag not in complex with MHC
- This lack of MHC Restriction for BCR recognition means that the Ab response elicited by B Cell Activation is rather weak, often needing T Cell Help (Further Activation) to produce their maximal response
- Tolerance is a state of specific immune unresponsiveness to antigens that have the ability to induce an immune response (self and innocuous antigens). This controls self-reactivity
- There are 2 main mechanisms of Tolerance:

### Central Tolerance

- In the thymus and bone marrow (Primary Lymphoid Organs, as B and T cells develop and central tolerance occurs
- If a self-reactive T Cell is generated during development that recognises self Ag, it can be clonally deleted and undergo Apoptosis
- In addition, for T cells there can be the induction of Natural T Reg cells if they recognise self Ag strongly
- Self-Reactive B Cells can undergo Clonal Deletion, receptor editing can occur, where the B cell alters the specificity of the receptor via VDJ Recombination to reduce specificity for self Ag
- B Cells that recognise self Ag strongly can induce an intrinsic state, where the activation threshold is extremely high so that they will not become activated when they are released into the periphery - This is Anergy
- Central tolerance mechanisms are now known to be extremely leaky as lots of Ag are not expressed in the Primary Lymphoid Organs or only form later in development, which is where the importance of peripheral tolerance mechanisms arises

### Peripheral Tolerance

- Peripheral tolerance can occur via
1. Active suppression by other immune cells such as regulatory T and B Cells
2. Induction of T Regs
3. Ignorance - Where Ag to which T and B Cells are reactive to are sequestered/localised to immunologically privileged sites (where B and T Cells rarely migrate to - such as Testes and Eyes), reducing the chance of Ag recognition
4. Ag Induced Apoptosis - If a cell strongly recognises an Ag, it will be strongly activated, which induces Apoptosis

# Autoimmunity and Its Influencing Factors

- Autoimmunity can arise when one or a number of these tolerance mechanisms breaks down
- The most likely sequence in the development of autoimmune diseases is:
1. Self or foreign antigen recognition by innate sensors
2. Inflammatory response
3. Activation of previously quiescent (inactive) autoreactive B and T lymphocytes
4. Damage to healthy tissues
- There has been a sharp rise in the incidence in autoimmune diseases in the developed world in the past few decades
- This goes far beyond what can be accounted for by genetics and so must be caused by the environment
- Once an individual has already presented with an established autoimmune disease, it is sometimes difficult to infer the exact cause or mechanism as it is often difficult to distinguish cause from effect
- The factors which have been implicated in autoimmunity are:

### Genes

- A large amount of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with autoimmune disease have been identified in the noncoding region of the genome which regulate and control the expression of coding genes and subsequently, protein levels

### Environment

### Epigenetics

- In the context of rheumatoid arthritis, Synovial Fibroblasts seem to acquire a lot of epigenetic markers such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation, heavily altering their behaviour
- This then leads these fibroblasts to become hyperactivated and invasive, contributing to inflammation

### Microbiome

- In Germ-Free Mice (no Microbiome) where autoimmunity is induced, there is often no inflammatory response, despite the fact that Dysbiosis (Reduction/Loss of Microbiome) exacerbates immune responses

---

# Autoimmune Diseases

- An autoimmune disease is a pathophysiological state wherein immune responses are directed against self and cause tissue damage
- There are around 80> inflammatory disorders which have been defined as autoimmune disease with different prevalence and tissue involvement
- The prevalence is approximately 3 -9%
- Women are affected more than men
- In systemic lupus erythematous the ratio of female to male suffers is 10:1

The tissue involvement can be:

- Organ specific e.g. myasthenia gravis and Type 1 Diabetes
- Limited and systemic (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and SLE)
- Disseminated
- They are clinically heterogenous (lots of different causes)
- Despite the clinical heterogeneity, genome wide studies have identified over 300 susceptibility loci
- There are many common loci across the diseases which suggests common pathways, explaining why some individuals with autoimmunity often develop other autoimmune conditions
- A lot of patients with Type 1 Diabetes may have co-concurrence with Coeliac’s disease, and the same is the case for ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease
- They pose a unique medical challenge with a large financial burden on health care

---

# Typical Progression of Autoimmune Disease - NYC

1. There is an environmental trigger in a genetically predisposed individual (Initiation phase)
2. This leads to the clinical disease and disease presentations (Propagation phase)
3. This then worsens due to the continued immune activation
4. Epitope spreading then occurs which is where antigen epitopes are spread to a much larger pool of immune cells than they did originally due to their release following an initial immune response. This increases the self-reactivity
- Epitope spreading is when autoantigens which were not originally available become new targets after the original attack, exacerbating the immune response
- Eventually the individual goes back into a resolution phase, but the disease never reaches the subclinical stage
- Another clinical feature of autoimmune diseases is that the patients go through flares and remissions
- Ideally the treatment strategies should aim to get the patient to the resolution phase (right of the graph)

# Rheumatoid Arthritis

- This is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease which primarily affects the joints via synovial inflammation
- It typically affects the Metacarpophalangeal, Metatarsophalangeal and Proximal Interphalangeal joints
- It is associated with stiffness, swelling and tenderness of the joints
- It can eventually lead to irreversible bone and cartilage damage and disability
- The Synovial Membrane consists of Macrophage-Like and Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes and is only 1-2 cells thick in healthy individuals with few cells present within the Synovium
- In rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory cells (All WBC Types) are present in the synovium and lead to inflammation of the synovium

![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 16.25.33.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_16.25.33.png)

- It may present with rheumatoid nodules (pictured), pulmonary involvement, vasculitis and other systemic co-morbidities
- Around 20% of patients present with rheumatoid nodules
- They are non-tender and are typically found overlying exposed joints
- They are immunologically distinct to the cell populations found in the joints
- The vasculitis can present as nail infarcts or cutaneous ulceration
- Around 1% of patients present with this
- Early diagnosis is key to therapeutic success
- Risk factors for poor outcomes include:
1. High disease activity
2. Presence of autoantibodies
3. Early joint damage

### Epidemiology and Aetiology

- It affects around 1% of the population in the UK
- Positive family history increases risk by 3-5 times
- GWAS studies have implicated over 100 risk loci which mostly relate to immune mechanisms
- There are different types of rheumatoid arthritis with clinically and pathologically different:
1. ACPA (Anti-Citrullinated Peptide Antigen)+/Seropositive
2. Seronegative

---

# Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors

### Genetics

- Around 40% of the gene weight involved in the development of rheumatoid arthritis relates to the HLA system
- In particular, it relates to the class II MHC
- The risk alleles (HLA-DRB1 and  HLA-DRB4) lead to an amino acid change in the hypervariable region of the β chain of the MHC class II
- HLA-DRB1 encodes the AA sequence in Positions 70-74 in the MHC β chain .
- This is called the Shared Epitope and is associated with more severe disease manifestations as this region is efficient at producing pathogenic T Cell Responses
- These different amino acids do not directly contact the antigen, but they seem to bind citrullinated peptides somewhat better than the wild type allele
- CTLA-4 also is associated with the disease risk which acts to block the action of CD80 and CD86 on antigen presenting cells
- PTPN22 is also associated with disease risk and acts to modulate T cell receptor signalling and B cell receptor signalling by dephosphorylating intracellular signalling molecules involved in the propagation of antigen receptor signalling
- Both CTLA-4 and PTPN22 are commonly found in autoimmune diseases and are involved in the inhibition of immune responses

![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 16.35.51.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_16.35.51.png)

### Environmental

1. Mucosal surfaces: These are highly important in autoimmune diseases as they experience local tissue stress and develop neoepitopes involved in autoimmunity

**Lungs**

1. Smoking increases risk
- This is perhaps due to increased protein citrullination as a result of smoking
1. Silica - Dust inhalation increased risk in post 9/11 responders
2. Textile Dust

**Oral**

- Periodontal disease as Porphyromonas gingivalis can express PAD and lead to the
generation of citrullinated peptides
- However, recent studies are not conclusive in this

**Gastrointestinal**

- Germ-free mice do not develop disease in inflammatory arthritis models
- Early RA patients display increased Prevotella copri and reduced Bacteroides spp (dysbiosis)
1. Vitamin D Deficiency
2. Infectious Agents
3. Obesity

---

# Autoantibodies in Rheumatoid Arthritis

- Susceptibility epitope is linked with seropositive for antibodies against citrullinated peptides (ACPA) and against IgG (rheumatoid factor)
- ACPA and RF present in 50-70% of patients at diagnosis and remain stable throughout disease
- They can sometimes be detected years or decades before clinical disease manifests

### Rheumatoid Factor

- It was first described by Waaler and Rose in the 1940s
- Primarily IgM antibodies that bind to the Fc portion of human IgG.
- Due to IgM's pentameric nature, RF forms large immune complexes
- High levels or RF are associated with worse prognosis
- It is not specific for RA and is detected in other autoimmune diseases, systemic infections and in up to 10% of healthy subjects
- It is detected by latex bead agglutination, using beads coated with human IgG added to a solution of the IgM from the serum of the RA Px
- If RF is present, it binds to the IgG Fc portion on the beads
- This results in the agglutination (sticking together) of the latex bead particles and cause the appearance of precipitate or speckles

![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 16.41.34.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_16.41.34.png)

### Anti-Citrullinated Peptide Antibody Responses

- Protein citrullination occurs commonly, particularly in inflammation and tissue stress.
- This is carried out by Peptidyl Arginine Deaminase 1 (PAD1) which converts Arginine to Citrulline
- It even occurs under steady state conditions in osteoclasts
- However, it becomes more common in other cells under inflammatory conditions
- The exact role is unknown, but it is suggested it citrullinates chemokines, enhancing their activity and thus participates in migration
- Other theories include that it may be important in histone modifications and thus may somehow lead to altered gene expression and also that citrullinated peptides bind MHC better than uncitrullinated peptides
- Antibodies against citrullinated peptides are not generated normally. these are called ACPAs
- ACPAs can be IgG, IgM or IgA isotypes, not just the IgM of R
- This range of Ab Isotypes present is indicative of the role of T cell help in ACPA formation as B cells need T cells in order to be able to class switch
- ACPAs can bind citrullinated residues on many self-proteins including vimentin, α-enolase, fibronectin, fibrinogen, histones and type II collagen
- These are found around the body but a lot of them are components of the joint
- Altered glycosylation results in enhanced binding of Fc receptors and citrullinated peptides
- In RA, B cell producing ACPAs are found in both the synovium and circulation

---

# Development of High Risk of RA to Synovitis

### Stage 1 - Loss of Tolerance at Mucosal Sites

- There is a lot of evidence that tolerance is lost at mucosal sites
1. An insult to the mucosa, for example, smoking or intestinal dysbiosis
2. This results in immune cell activation as well increasing the expression of the enzyme which
converts arginine to citrulline (PADI), producing citrullinated peptides 
3. Together with activated immune cells, there is then a reaction which most likely occurs in lymph nodes, where the citrullinated peptide binds to the HLA-DR allele of a genetic predisposed individual
4. This leads to the B cell – T cell interaction which results in the generation of ACPAs
- This loss of tolerance occurs systemically, with inflammation then becoming localised to the joint as lymph node biopsies in early RA suggest T cell activation and ACPA generation occurs distal from the synovium

![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 16.51.45.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_16.51.45.png)

### Stage 2 - ACPA-Associated Disease (Prior to Onset of Clinical RA)

- Osteoclast precursors are dependent on the enzyme which converts arginine to citrulline (PADI) for their differentiation
- They start to express this enzyme in their development and  express citrullinated antigens on their surface in a non-inflamed state
- The systemic loss of tolerance means that the ACPAs can now bind to these citrullinated antigens and activate the osteoclasts to further mature but also produce IL-8 which acts on the osteoclasts in an autocrine manner to enhance maturation and activation of Osteoclasts
- They are the primary targets of ACPAs
- This results in:
1. Bone loss due to the increased maturation/activation of osteoclasts
2. Arthralgia (joint pain)
- If ACPAs are transferred into mice, they get bone loss and arthralgia, but they do not get Rheumatoid Arthritis (no synovitis)
- In this sense, RA Synovitis is not a classic autoantibody mediated disease in the sense that disease is not transferred just by transferring autoantibodies

![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 16.54.32.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_16.54.32.png)

### Stage 3 - Symptomatic RA

- There then needs to be a minor injury - Second Hits - (and typically inconsequential joint challenge) either through injury or infection to produce RA Synovitis following Osteoclast activation and ACPA formation
- This minor injury to the synovium then leads to the transfer of the disease from the bone (where the osteoclasts are causing the bone loss) to the synovium
- Synovium is not very well protected as there is a single layer of cells with no tight junctions and therefore the influx of immune cells is not prevented
in that sense
- There are two theories as to how the transfer happens
1. The trabecular bone is principally affected by the osteoclasts and the erosion transitions from
the trabeculae to the cortical bone
- This in turn leads to the diffusion of soluble mediators (including IL-8) to the synovium resulting in immune cell activation in the synovium
1. Diffusion of soluble molecules between the bone and synovium

![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 16.56.46.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_16.56.46.png)

# Summary of Rheumatoid Arthritis Onset

1. Genetic and environmental factors lead to local inflammatory changes and immune cell activation, resulting in a breach of tolerance and ACPA generation
2. The antibodies then get localised in the joints (Articular Localisation), where they cause Leukocyte and Stromal (Osteoclast) Dysregulation via IL-8 to produce clinical RA
- This is known as the window of opportunity for treatment (preclinical RA)
- Ideally you would want to treat individuals here before it transitions to full-blown clinical RA but this is difficult to do as Dx of Preclinical RA is hard

![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 16.57.47.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_16.57.47.png)

# Pathological Pathways in Rheumatoid Arthritis

- In the synovium of an individual who has had RA for a significant time period, most immune cell types are present
- Stromal cells such as fibroblasts and chondrocytes get activated and contribute to joint damage:
- Fibroblasts assume aggressive inflammatory matrix regulatory and invasive phenotype
- There is enhanced chondrocyte catabolism
- It has been suggested that RA Px can be classified based on the main cell type driving the Pathogenesis, leading to 3 classes of RA:
1. Myeloid-Dominant
2. Lymphocytic-Dominant
3. Fibroid-Dominant
- Osteoclastogenesis occurs
- Angiogenesis occurs and this promotes the recruitment of cells such as Th1 and Th17 cells which are involved in later RA
- TNF is a particularly important cytokine in RA and acts as a therapeutic target

![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 16.58.56.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_16.58.56.png)

# Diagnosis and Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis

### Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis

- Non-specific presentations (also occur in osteoarthritis, reactive arthritis and psoriatic arthritis):
1. Tender and swollen joints of recent onset
2. Morning joint stiffness
3. Elevated ESR/CRP
- The criteria shown in the diagram was amended 2010:
1. Positive serology for ACPA or rheumatoid factor
2. Having at least one small joint affected (determined by ultrasound or clinician)
3. Duration of symptoms would be expected to be > 6 weeks to diagnose RA
4. Acute phase response: CRP and ESR

![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 17.00.41.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_17.00.41.png)

### Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis

- Full remission is not typical
- Conventionally, Px take Aspirin or other NSAIDs to ease Sx but these do not prevent the progression of RA
- Patients are typically on at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) to reduce joint damage and relieve Sx
- These can be synthetic and biological
- Their mechanisms of action are largely unknown

**Biological DMARDs:**

- The 4 main targets are 1) TNF-Blockade, 2) T Cell Co-stimulation Blockage 3) IL-6R Blockade and 4) B Cell Depletion
- Etanercept is a soluble TNF receptor that is joined to an Fc fragment
- Adalimumab and Inflixmab are monoclonal antibodies
- Abatacept (T cell co-stimulation blockade) might be in some use in RA and is a soluble CTLA-4
- Il-6 and B cell depletion are also used (IL-6R Blockage due to Tocilizumab and B Cell Depletion using Rituximab)
- Immune responses can arise from using monoclonal antibodies, so there is a large
amount of research on making less immunogenic biologics which target the same molecules
- As, if you start making antibodies against the biologic, the treatment becomes ineffective
- Anti-TNF:
- Studies have shown that anti-TNF is extremely important in treating RA
- Glucocorticoids have rapid disease-modifying effects but have serious long-term side effects and therefore are not used often and used cautiously

# Myasthenia Gravis

- This is an autoimmune disease of the neuromuscular junction
- It has a prevalence of 1:5000
- It acts as the paradigm for antibody-mediated autoimmunity as the disease is transferable simply by transferring autoantibodies unlike RA
- About 10% of mothers with myasthenia gravis can transmit the IgG autoantibodies via the placenta, so upon being born the child can have transient neonatal myasthenia gravis
- This only persists for around 3 weeks as the autoantibodies get broken down and the baby does not produce any more of them
- nAChR clustering and synapse formation occurs due to Agrin released by the Motor Neuron, which binds to LRP4 on the Sarcolemma to activate MuSK (Muscle Specific Kinase)
- The most common form of myasthenia gravis involves Anti AChR antibodies (IgG1 and IgG3)
- IgG1 and IgG3 can fix complement whereas IgG4 cannot
- It involves Autoantibodies that target proteins on the postsynaptic membrane (mainly nAChr), leading to weakness and fatigue of skeletal muscle
- There are three mechanisms in which receptor activation is prevented:
1. The antibody binding leads to increased turnover and internalisation of the nAChRs by crosslinking of these receptors, resulting in a reduced number of nAChRs being present on the cell surface
- This is the most important mechanism
1. Once the antibody has bound to the receptor, it can lead to complement activation which damages the muscle fibre, disrupting the synaptic transmission and the ability to contract
- IgG1 and IgG3 are the two IgG subclasses that bind to complement very well
1. Direct blockage of the ACh binding site on nAChRs by the autoantibodies. 
- This is not the most common or important mechanism
- Rarer forms of Myasthenia Gravis include:
1. Anti-MuSK (IgG4): Disrupt physiological function of muscle specific kinase in neuromuscular junction/synapse maintenance and formation
- The IgG4 subclass means they are very poor at fixing complement and so cause disease via direct MuSK interference without complement or other immune components
- These are thought to disrupt the role of MuSK in forming nAChR clusters at the points of contact with the nerve
1. Anti-LRP4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 4 - It binds Agrin to stimulate MuSK)
2. Anti-agrin - Their pathogenicity is unknown
- All these antibodies could be present in the same patient, but whether these antibodies are pathogenic or simply act as  readout for disease is unclear
- The thymus and thymomas are involved in many patients

---

# Epidemiology, Aetiology and Clinical Features of Myasthenia Gravis

### Epidemiology and Aetiology

- Around 85% of myasthenia gravis patients present with generalised muscle weakness and 50% with just ocular weakness
- It has a bimodal age of onset, common in young women and older men
- When MG occurs with Thymoma, it is caused by the Thymoma
- There are three main classifications:
1. Early onset AChR MG (women < 50)
- Early onset GWAS have shown an association with HLA-B*08 which is MHC Class I unlike the Class II Implicated in RA
- PTPN22 and TNIP1 are also implicated
1. Late onset AChR MG (men > 50)
- This is the most common type
- Early and Late Onset are associated with Mutations/Polymorphisms in HLA Class II and CTLA-4 (also risk alleles in RA)
1. AChR MG associated with thymoma
- This is the least common type
- These groups differ in HLA associations and thymic pathology, but not in the IgG AChR characteristics
- Anti-MuSK antibodies have pharmacological rather than immunological consequences, due to lack of Complement fixation via IgG4
- Patients are often more severely affected than AChR MG

### Clinical Features

Weakness and fatigue of skeletal muscles:

1. Ocular muscles are affected leading to diplopia and ptosis typically early in the disease
- Diplopia = double vision
- Ptosis = eyelid drooping
1. Bulbar muscles are affected leading to dysphagia and dysarthria
- Dysphagia = difficulty swallowing
- Dysarthria = difficulty speaking
1. Limb weakness may occur proximally and may be asymmetric
- It can worsen throughout the day
- It is though that ocular muscles are commonly affected as they express less AChRs in general, so their loss means those muscles are more affected
- The ocular muscles also contract more rapidly and frequently than other muscles which means they can become exhausted more easily

---

# Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis

1. Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. pyridostigmine)
- This is useful for anti-AChR MG and are the first line of treatment
- Their use is limited in anti-MuSK MG as ACh binding to nAChRs leads to dissociation of nAChR clusters/aggregates. As nAChR aggregation is already impacted/affected in Anti-MuSK MG, this increased [ACh] further causes dissociation of nAChR clusters, exacerbating signals
1. Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants (Azathioprine)
2. Thymectomy (thymus removal) for both thymoma and non-thymomatous AChR disease
- Thymoma is normally benign in the MG patients
1. Plasmapheresis
2. IV Immunoglobulin

# Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies - NYC

- These are rare with a prevalence of 6-10 in 100,000 people
- They are a group of acquired autoimmune muscle disorders
- They include:
1. Dermatomyositis
2. Polymyositis
3. Inclusion body myositis
4. Immune-mediated necrotising myopathies
- They are normally diagnosed by muscle histology:
- In dermatomyositis, there is peri fascicular inflammation and no immune infiltration between the muscle fibres
- In polymyositis there is a large amount of immune infiltration between muscle fibres
- Inclusion body myositis is characterised by eosinophilic inclusions
- Immune mediated necrotising myopathies are characterised by muscle shape loss due to necrosis, death and regeneration
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 17.13.55.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_17.13.55.png)
    
- Dermatomyositis and polymyositis are immunologically very distinct although the symptoms might be similar
- The main difference in symptoms is the skin involvement in dermatomyositis
- The typical presentation for both is subacute painless proximal limb weakness
- They have different underlying pathological mechanisms
- Dermatomyositis involves an antibody-driven microangiopathy Type I interferon pathway
- Type I interferon is also implicated in lupus
- Polymyositis involves T-cell mediated myopathy

---

# Dermatomyositis and its Immunopathlogy - NYC

- There are childhood and adult forms
- There can be variable skin/muscle involvement
- There is a proximal pattern of muscle weakness
- This shows the classic clinical features of dermatomyositis
- Calcium containing nodules are often found in younger patients
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-09-18 at 17.15.43.png](%5B012%5D%20Autoimmune%20Disease%20and%20the%20Musculoskeletal%20S%20cb20c4e6aca645ea8af5d27228cec636/Screenshot_2021-09-18_at_17.15.43.png)
    

### Immunopathology

1. Complement injury to endothelial cells results in depletion of muscle capillary beds resulting in muscle fibre necrosis
2. Th1 and Th17 (typical for autoimmunity) are seen in the inflammatory infiltrate as well as B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (produce most of the Type I interferons)

# Polymyositis - NYC

- It is the least defined and any features that do not fall under the other four categories gets diagnosed as polymyositis
- It results in painless proximal myopathy
- The inflammatory infiltrate contains CD8 T cells which lead to perforin release and Fas on muscle fibres with FasL on CD4 T cells leading to apoptosis

### Autoantibodies

- Unlike RA and MG, autoantibodies in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies have not shown to be directly causative of damage to tissue
- The autoantibodies have not been definitely proven to be causative of the symptoms
