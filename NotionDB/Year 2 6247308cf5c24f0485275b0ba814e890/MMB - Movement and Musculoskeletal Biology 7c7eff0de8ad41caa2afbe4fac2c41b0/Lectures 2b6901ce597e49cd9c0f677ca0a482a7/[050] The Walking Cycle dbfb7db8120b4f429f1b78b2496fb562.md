# [050] The Walking Cycle

# Balance Requirement for Human Bipedal Locomotion - Part 1

- Bipedality is not that common (except in birds) but is commonly observed across most classes of Tetrapods
- In All Cases, Bipedalism frees up one par of limbs, which can be used for alternative functions to movement/weight bearing (flying, digging, swimming etc.)
- However, as Bipedality means 2 vs 4 limbs are being used for movement, it does not allow for the maximum speeds that are observed in Quadruped Tetrapods to be generated
- However, movements generated can be sustained over very long distances at relatively high speeds in Bipedal individuals
- Great Apes are facultative Bipedals and use Bipedalism to varying degrees, with some using Bipedal Movements only when their upper limbs are occupied and some using Bipedal Movements even when their hands are free

---

# Habitual Vs Facultative Bipedal Locomotion

- Human Bipedal Locomotion is Habitual/Obligate, not Facultative (as it is for other primates)
- Habitual/Obligate Bipedality = Walking or running on two legs is the primary method of locomotion
- Facultative Bipedality = Animal that is capable of running or walking on two legs in a few circumstances (E.g Upper Limb being occupied)
- The Human Bipedal Locomotion is distinct due to its high energy efficiency and smooth, fluid movements
- It is much more versatile and efficient than that observed in other primates both in the speed and distances covered as well as the loads carried at the same time

---

# Evidence for Bipedal Walking

- 3.6 million year old Fossil Foot prints preserved in Volcanic Ash were found in the 1970s at Laetoli, Tanzania and indicate Bipedal Walking
- There is dispute over the similarity of walking between Ancient and Modern humans as the prints seem to show shallower arch imprints (weight distribution is more widespread over the sole of the foot) and a more ape-like, divergent/deviated (not parallel to others) big toe than modern human prints
- Therefore, the individual that made these prints are likely to not be modern humans, but rather *Australopithicus afarensis* (Modern Human Ancestor) - They had the same Habitual Bipedality as Modern Humans (due to long stretch of uniform prints) despite a different foot anatomy and weight transmission across the foot
- 1.5 Million Years old human-like foot prints were found in Ileret, Kenya and are attributed to *Homo ergaster*
- In this fossil, the big toe is parallel to the other toes, all the toes are short and the Transverse and Longitudinal Foot Arches and subsequent weight transmission across the foot are distinctly human like
- The size, spacing and depth of the impressions indicate body weight, stride length and gait frequency within the range of modern humans (Whoever made the print was likely around 1.75m tall)

---

# Complexity of Bipedal Locomotion

- The Evolutionary age of Human Bipedal Locomotion as well as the complexity of coordination of various systems (equilibrium, proprioception, vision) is also evident in how difficult it is to simulate locomotion with AI

---

# Balance, Vision, Proprioception and Gait

- Vision, Vestibular Apparatus and Proprioception (Sense of self-movement and body position) are all involved in maintaining balance during standing and moving, over the small surface area of the soles of the feet
- These systems are integrated by the CNS to create an overall representation of Body Position, movement and acceleration
- This is not simple as is indicated by the decline in balance in the elderly due to continuously declining proprioception, weakening muscles and a declining eye sight in physiological ageing
- However, once this has been learnt, it becomes fine-tuned to the individual to provide fine turned integration and control of movement
- Romberg's Test = Sensory test which checks the integration of vision, balance and proprioception.
- If at least 2 of these systems still work, balance can be maintained
- By taking away vision, the test helps to uncover any disordered proprioception or a vestibular disorder (Bony Labyrinth) that may have been masked by an overdependence on Vision
- A positive Romberg Test is when a Px becomes more unsteady when their eyes are closed
- Negative Test = Px able to stand heel-to-toe vs side by side, with eyes closed, for 6s and then the subject closes their eyes while the examiner observes for 1m to look for instability

---

# Sense of Equilibrium and Tabetic Gait

- Px with Sensory Ataxis (E.g Tabes Dorsalis Lesions found on the Posterior Aspect of the Spinal Cord where the Ascending Tracts are found) have limited/no proprioceptive functioning and have a 'stomping' gait because they use the sensation of the impact of the floor hitting the ground to guide their walk rather than touch or proprioception and hence, they maximise this impact via stomping to maintain adequate sensory information regarding movement
- The soles of the shoes of these Px are said to be uniformly worn-out as the entire plantar aspect of the foot strikes the ground at one time

# Energy Efficiency of Bipedal Walking and Running

- Average Human walking speed = 4.5 km/h or 2.8 mph
- This is the most energy efficient walking speed
- Humans choose to walk and not run up to 9 km/h or 5.6 mph as it becomes more energy expensive >9 km/h to walk than to run
- The difference in energy expenditure for low and fast pace running is very small, with the energy cost to transition from walking to running being very small
- Humans are also very energy efficiency at carrying extra mass, resulting in very little increases in metabolic cost with additional weight as it is easier to adjust the movement of 2 limbs to improve energy efficiency than it is to adjust the movement of 4 limbs

### Energy Efficiency of Walking and Running

- For Facultative Bipeds, Bipedal and Quadrupedal Walking do not vary in energy cost
- Human Bipedal Gait is must less energy costly than the Bipedal/Quadrupedal Gait of Facultative Biped, allowing for smooth transition between the 2
- The Metabolic Cost of moving a set body weight is much larger for Facultative Bipeds like Chimpanzees than it is for Humans
- This is because
1. Humans have a much higher lower limb length:body length, allowing for longer strides to be taken by humans (more distance travelled per movement)
2. A larger relative muscle volume is activated in Facultative Biped Locomotion per step when compared to the Muscle Volume activated in human movement
3. Humans walking with extended limbs require less muscle activation than the bent-hip-bent-knee gait of Facultative Tetrapods 

---

# Role of Tendons in Reducing Energy Expenditure in Walking and Running

- Human tendons are extremely long and powerful which add elasticity to the muscle, reducing energy loss during contraction, hence improving the efficiency of energy expenditure during muscle contraction
- With these efficiencies derived from evolution, growth and learning, humans are very well tuned for location, partily replaced by Power Input from an Exoskeleton
- To reduce the metabolic rate of muscle without providing an additional energy resource would require an improvement in the efficiency of the human-machine system as a whole and would be remarkable given the apparent optimisation of human gait

---

# Energy Efficiency in Running

- In running, most change in length is not in the muscle belly length but in the stretch and recoil of the tendons
- For muscles with large tendons (E.g Achilles Tendon), a significant proportion of Kinetic Energy is stored as Elastic Strain/Potential Energy
- The ligaments of the feet (notably the Arches of the feet) also store a significant proportion (17%) of Kinetic Energy as Elastic Potential Energy
- Elastic Potential Energy = Energy stored in an object's conformation due to elastic deformation by work performed on it
- Together these tendons act as springs, to approximately halve the work required by the muscles to produce movement in running

---

# Differences in Human and Chimpanzee Bipedal Gait

- When humans walk, there is very little lateral deviation of the Centre of Gravity (Around the Level of the Pelvis) from the Midline, allowing the individual to walk in a straight line
- This lack of lateral deviation occurs due to the counter rotation of the hips (when stepping forward) and the shoulders during walking to keep the Centre of Gravity (Around the Pelvis) close to the Midline AKA when stepping forward with left foot, right shoulder swings forward
- Chimpanzees have large lateral deviation in their centre of gravity when they walk in a straight line as the stiffness of their vertebral column prevent sufficient counterrotation of the pelvis to maintain their centre of gravity over the midline
- This means that as the chimpanzee walks, the ipsilateral shoulder moves forward as the lower limb moves forward
- In humans, the arms swing during walking and running to maintain and support smooth movement
- During walking, there is large vertical displacement of the centre of gravity above the extended lower limb in humans (much larger than in Chimpanzees)
- This is because of the long length of human limbs vs Chimpanzee limbs and specialised mechanisms within humans that allow for easy vertical displacement of the body during walking

# Abductors/Hip Stabilisers and the Corresponding Patterns of Cortical Femoral Bone

- During walking, Large Abduction of the Contralateral side of the Hip to the moving leg is involved in keeping the pelvis stable and preventing the hip from tilting towards the Ipsilateral Side as the leg being moved
- The pattern of Cortical Bone distribution in the Human Femoral Neck reflects the fact that it functions efficiency under the compression applied upon it by the Gluteus Medius during the Hip Stabilisation Phase of the Walking Cycle
- As the Gluteus Medius and Minimus insert onto the Greater Trochanter of the Femur on the Lateral Side of the Femur, there is more Cortical Bone found on the Medial Side of the Shaft of the Femur to compensate for the compression of the bone during Walking by Gluteus Medius and Minimus
- Cortical Bone is evenly distributed along the shaft/neck fo the Chimpanzee Femur as they do not use Hip Abductors to stabilise the Hip During walking but rather, they evenly distribute their weight through their Femoral Neck as Hip Stabilising muscles are found evenly distributed around the Femoral Neck (due to their quadruped and climbing movements)
- This even distribution of muscles around the femur means that they compress the femur evenly around the femoral Neck, meaning that cortical bone is not localised to one side of the neck

![Screenshot 2021-10-25 at 16.13.12.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-25_at_16.13.12.png)

---

# Abductors/Hip Stabilisers

- Ratio of Gluteus Maximus:Gluteus Medius is much larger in humans than Chimpanzees/Facultative Bipeds
- This difference in muscle ratio allows Chimpanzees to produce equally powerful Hip Rotation, Abduction an Extension whereas humans are possible of stronger hip extension by Gluteus Maximus and weaker hip abduction and rotation by Gluteus Medius
- The difference in Gluteus Medius Origins and insertions account for its hip stabilising power in humans:
- In chimpanzees, it originates more posteriorly, producing powerful hip rotation
- In humans, it originates more anterolaterally, allowing for more powerful hip abduction

---

# Postnatal Ontogeny of Gait - Increase of Energy Efficiency

- The nature of an individuals gait is dependent on the length of the lower limb and the arrangement of muscles that act on the hip - As these factors change with age, the infant and adult gaits are remarkably different
- When young, the gait is jerky unsteady and wide-based at the hip, with a flexed knee present during heel-strike in the walking phase due to a focus on maintaining balance over smooth movement (as Integration and Fine-Tuning of Balance, Vision and Proprioception is still occurring)
- When young, there is also no coordinated arm swing, heel-strike and children start to run at slower speeds due to their shorter leg length
- As the individual ages, the legs get longer and the coordination/integration of balance, proprioception and vision improves.
- This means there is a coordinated upper arm swing (to further improve the balance and smoothness of movement) alongside an increase in stride length and reduction in base width as the leg elongates
- Finally, Knee Extension eventually occurs at heel-strike, maximising the energy efficiency  of walking

# Structure of Human Bipedal Walking and Running - Start of Pt 2

### Walking

- Bipedal walking consists of an inverted pendulum movement, where the centre of mass is found above the midpoint between the two legs
- When the leg is in a vertical position, the centre of mass is at its highest point and when the legs are furthest apart, the centre of mass is at its lowest point
- Whilst the centre of gravity goes up and down, the body itself remains in roughly the same transverse plane and doesn't move up and down
- The kinetic energy of forward motion is constantly being traded for a rise in Gravitational Potential Energy
- One foot always rests on the floor
- Ground contact occurs through the heel-strike and weight is transmitted from the heel to the toe from the lateral (little) to medial (big toe) aspects of the foot to produce the push off
- The legs are kept mostly extended at the heel strike, mid-stance and the push off, during most of the walking cycle (notably the limb on the ground)
- The limb that is moving may flex just after push-off/toe-off

![Screenshot 2021-10-20 at 18.10.48.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-20_at_18.10.48.png)

### Running

- Energy is saved by the 'bouncing ball' principle, with the whole body acting as the bouncing ball, making elastic collisions with the ground upon landing to minimise energy loss
- The centre of mass is at its lowest when the leg is vertical as the impact of landing from the Ballistic Phase is absorbed by bending the leg and consequently storing/transmitting this energy into muscles and tendons
- During running, there is a conversion between Kinetic, Gravitational Potential and Elastic Energy to produce the bouncing movements seen in running
- The trunk is flexed forward and head carriage excursion (head dropping/nodding forwards) is counteracted/prevented by the action of the strong Nuchal Ligament on the Posterior Neck/Vertebral Column
- The whole body rises and falls alongside the centre of gravity during Running due to the Ballistic Phase, not just the centre of gravity (as is the case in walking)
- The legs are mostly bent at the hip and knee joints during all phases of the running cycle
- Arms are strongly flexed and act to counterbalance the body to prevent excessive rotation of the body whilst moving forward
- An airbourne (Ballistic Phase) is observed where both feet are off the ground
- Ground contact occurs via mid-foot strike (balls of the feet), not at the heel

# Walking Cycle

- Series of movements needed to return the lower limb to its original position during walking
- The walking cycle (between 2 heel strikes) can be divided into:
1. Stance Phase - Roughly 60% of the Cycle
2. Swing Phase - Roughly 40% of the Cycle 

### Walking Cycle

### Stance Phase

1. Heel Strike - Heel of Leg makes contact with the ground
2. Loading Response - Distal part of the foot is lowered so that the foot is flat on the ground. Here, the Trunk/Centre of Mass is slightly behind the moving limb
3. Midstance - Body weight is shifted forwards over the foot which has just been placed flat on the ground
4. Terminal Stance/Heel Off - Weight is shifted medially towards the big toe of the same leg in preparation for the Toe Off to move the limb forwards. The Trunk/centre of Mass is now shifted forwards, in front of the moving limb

### Swing Phase

- Toe off of one leg happens simultaneously with the Heel Strike of the other leg to ensure that one leg is on the ground at all times.
1. Preswing/Toe Off - Individual pushes down on the big toe to lift the leg and initiate a swing of the leg to move it forwards
2. Initial and Mid Swing - Leg is flexed and swings forward to move the limb forward
3. Terminal Swing - Leg is extended with the foot being dorsiflexed in preparation for the Heel Strike

![Screenshot 2021-10-21 at 12.22.51.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-21_at_12.22.51.png)

# Muscles of the Stance Phase

- Heel Strike - Extensor/Anterior Compartment of the Leg and a small amount of Thigh Adductors (Medial Compartment) and very small amount of Gluteus Maximus (to stabilise the hips)
- Gluteus Maximus is electrically silent during walking (minimal electrical activity during walking) but may be active at low levels to stabilise the trunk over the hip during the Stance Phase and to provide stability for the action of other muscles during the Swing Phase
- The Medial Compartment/Adductor muscle mass of the leg (mainly Adductor Magnus) extend the limb and pull the trunk forwards over the weight-bearing extended limb during the Heel Strike and Loading Response of the stance phase, assisted by the action of Quadriceps Femoris (Mainly Rectus Femoris due to its hip attachment)
- Midstance - Hip Abductors (Gluteus Medius and Minimus) stabilise the pelvis to prevent the pelvis from tilting towards the weight-bearing leg
- Terminal Stance and Preswing/Toe Off - Lateral Compartment of the Leg and the Leg Flexors (Posterior Compartment) evert the foot to shift the body weight onto the Big Toe in preparation for the Toe off
- The Plantar Flexor Muscles cause weight to be shifted distally onto the balls of the feet, allowing for Toe Off to occur
- Leg Extensors are also activated at the end of Toe Off in order to Dorsiflex the foot to prevent the foot/toes from dragging along the floor so that the foot is in the correct orientation for the next Heel Strike
- Just before the heel strike, the Foot is Dorsiflexed and Pronated/Everted

![Screenshot 2021-10-21 at 12.22.51.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-21_at_12.22.51%201.png)

---

# Muscle Group Activity during the Swing Phase

- Iliopsoas, Sartorius and Rectus Femoris (from Quadriceps Femoris) flex the hip and the Knee of the Swinging Limb to ensure it is not dragging along the floor
- The Anterior Leg Compartment (Extensors) Dorsiflex and Invert the foot at the Beginning of the Initial Swing and during the Terminal Swing
- During the Terminal Swing, Hamstrings (Posterior Compartment of the Thigh) extend the hip of the moving leg to terminate the swing phase and prevent hyperextension of the thigh
- During the Terminal Swing, the Quadriceps Femoris extends the leg so the heel is orientated towards the ground in preparation for the next Heel Strike

![Screenshot 2021-10-21 at 12.22.51.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-21_at_12.22.51%202.png)

# Walking Muscle Activity and Innervation

- Muscle Activation and corresponding Spinal Levels activated during the Swing and Stance Phases follows a pattern of Activation of Proximal to Distal Muscles (Thigh → Leg → Foot)
- Therefore, the propagation of APs distally down nerves activates nerves proximally to distal in order to produce the movements required for the walking cycle

[Muscle Activity in the Walking Cycle](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Muscle%20Activity%20in%20the%20Walking%20Cycle%208da2f669906e49fd81b5776e4a52347b.md)

# Foot as a Propulsive Organ - Part 3

- In its adaptation to Bipedal Locomotion, the human foot is the most specialised of all primate feet as it has:
1. No opposable big toe (Abduction of the Big Toe is prevented by the shape of the 1st Tarsometatarsal Joint)
2. Longitudinal Arch - Formed from the Unique shape of the Clanceo-Cuboid and Calcaneonavicular Joints
3. The form of the ankle joint allows the leg to move back and forth in a straight line over the foot vs around the foot in a circular manner
4. The unique weight transfer medially towards the big toe from the little toe during the midstance phase of the stride whilst distributing the body weight over the sole of the foot
- Humans also have very short toes compared to other primates as human toes are not needed to grip objects

---

# Foot Architecture

- Longitudinal Arch - Shaped by Architecture of the Calcaneus, Talus, Navicular and Cuboid (and the Metatarsals), with the Talus forming the Keystone of this Arch
- Medial Arch is more pronounced than Lateral Arch

![Screenshot 2021-10-25 at 16.54.35.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-25_at_16.54.35.png)

![Screenshot 2021-10-25 at 16.54.46.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-25_at_16.54.46.png)

### Foot Architecture - Longitudinal Arch

- Ligaments and other soft tissue structures connect the components of the Longitudinal Arch and make it flexible and elastic
- Deepest, the Short and Long Plantar Ligaments and the Plantar-Calcaneo-Navicular Ligmanets (Spring Ligament) contribute to the integrity of the Longitudinal Arch
- These are the strongest ligaments in the body as the entire body weight is supported primarily by these ligaments
- Superficially, Plantar Intrinsic Foot Muscles are found between the Deeper Ligaments and the Plantar Aponeurosis (Runs from the Base of the Calcaneus to the Base of the Phalanges and Metatarsals)
- These are important support for when the foot is put under load, for altering the shape of the arch and for storing kinetic energy as elastic potential energy to maintain energy efficiency of walking

![Screenshot 2021-10-25 at 17.43.01.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-25_at_17.43.01.png)

### Foot Architecture - Transverse Arch

- Shaped by the Cuneiforms predominantly but also the metatarsals
- It is most prominent in the Midfoot
- Its shape is maintained by:
1. Tarsal Ligaments
2. Long/Extrinsic Foot Muscles - Fibularis Longus and Tibialis Posterior and Anterior
3. Intrinsic Plantar Foot Muscles
4. Plantar Aponeurosis
- Extrinsic Foot Muscles are important for altering the shape of the Transverse Arch when walking
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-10-25 at 17.45.26.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-25_at_17.45.26.png)

# Joints of the Talus and Tibia/Fibula

### Talocrural Joints

- Between the Tibia, Fibula and Trochlea of the Talus (Talocrural Joint).
- This allows for Flexion and Extension of the Ankle, moving the weight of the body in a straight line over the foot (as the Tibia and Fibula are directly above the Talus)
- This means there is little lateral movement at this joint

### Subtalar Joints

- There are 2 Subtalar joints between the Talus and The Calcaneus and the Talus and the Navicular
- The Talus sits as a keystone above these joints
- The Talus rotated with the leg and acts to raise or lower the Medial Arch of the Foot
- This allows Abduction and Eversion to occur together, as do adduction and inversion

![Screenshot 2021-10-25 at 17.45.47.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-25_at_17.45.47.png)

# Foot Movement During Walking

- Pronation and Supination best describe the real compound movements of the foot - but one has to be careful not to mistake these complex movements with the pronation and supination of the forearm
- Pronation = Subtalar Eversion of the Foot, Dorsiflexion of the Ankle and Forefoot abduction
- This is seen in the first half of the Stance Phase
- Supination = Subtalar Inversion, Plantarflexion of the Ankle and Adduction of the forefoot
- This occurs in the later stages of the Midstance, in preparation for the toe-off as supination stars the propulsive phase of the Walking Cycle

![Screenshot 2021-10-25 at 18.00.10.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-25_at_18.00.10.png)

### Pronation and Supination

- They are associated with weight transfer across the foot during the walking cycle
- During Heel Strike, foot is pronated then moves to a neutral position and finally just before toe off, the Foot is Supinated
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-10-25 at 18.01.39.png](%5B050%5D%20The%20Walking%20Cycle%20dbfb7db8120b4f429f1b78b2496fb562/Screenshot_2021-10-25_at_18.01.39.png)

# Joints of the Talus and Spring Ligament

- Spring Ligament is important in enlarging the Articular Cavity (Joint Facet/Capsule) of the Talonavicular Joint for the Head of the Talus and Supporting it to allow for a wider degree of Eversion/Inversion
- A large proportion of the Body Weight is supported by this ligament and also has an embedded fibrocartilage to make it stiffer and more supportive

---

# Special Adaptations of the Foot to Walking

- At toe-off, the foot is supinated following the medial rotation of the leg and the Talus
- The hell then rotates outward, due to the lateral pull of the Achilles Tendon during toe off
- This locks the calcaneo-cuboid joint into a close-packed position, allowing the foot to become a rigid platform for propulsion from the toe off
- The human foot can be understood as a twisted plate due to the movements possible at the Subtalar Joint:
- In the Early part of the Stance Phase, the Spring Ligament is Relaxed as the foot is pronated
- During the late stance phase and toe-off, the human heel rotates outward and swings laterally onto the Calcaneo-cuboid joint.
- The foot plate then twists, which tightens the Spring Ligament during Toe-Off and Supination
- The range of movements in the Calcaneo-Cuboid Joint is much larger in humans than in chimpanzees
