# [045] Normal and Abnormal Bone Growth

# On Being the Right Size

- All mammalian bones form in similar ways
- Growth is programmed to determine size
- Differential growth produces different animals from same tetrapod body plan
- Vertebrates have an endoskeleton, making it easier for them to grow as if they had an exoskeleton, they would have to malt and shed this skeleton in order to grow, leaving the animal extremely vulnerable to damage whilst it grows (until the exoskeleton hardens)

---

# Ossification Centre

- Foetal skeleton begins in cartilaginous form and ossifies in a predictable sequence
- Each bone has defined ossification centres
- Appearance of these Ossification Centres, their size and location can be used to determine age of babies and children radiographically

---

# How are Bones Formed

- Form from **mesenchyme**
- Unlike most other tissues, bone forms by **appositional growth** (i.e. adding new bone to the edge of pre-existing bone) rather than interstitial growth (cells within the structure proliferating to cause Hypertrophy).
- In general, bony skeleton is derived from a cartilaginous precursor. Bone forms by 2 different methods:

### 1) Intramembranous Ossification

- E.g Skull Bones (Flat Bones)
- Simpler and more primitive type
- Initially, Mesenchyme forms the structure of bone, which is then replaced directly by bone
- Spongy/Trabecular bone forms first, then compact/Cortical bone
- Foetal Bones are incompletely formed to allow the bones to deform so they can migrate during embryological development to reach their final end point (E.g Skull has to migrate through the pelvis)

### 2) Endochondral Ossification

- Growth occurs at ends of long bones at growth plate.
- Originally demonstrated in John Hunter’s chickens.
- Advantage of having growth plate is shaft of bone can ossify long before growth is complete.
- This allows for the bone to elongate at the epiphyses/each end whilst maintaining the structural integrity of the bone (As Shaft has ossified)

# Intramembranous vs Endochondral Ossification

1. Intramembranous ossification replaces embryonic mesenchyme. Endochondral ossification replaces cartilage.
2. Intramembranous ossification is largely an intrauterine process. Endochondral continues up to adulthood.

# Growth Plate and Epiphyseal Fusion

### Structure

From the Secondary Ossification Centre/End of the Bone towards the shaft:

- Reserve of resting zone
- Proliferative zone
- Hypertrophy zone
- Zone of calcification
- Zone of ossification
- Calcification of Cartilage due to Hydroxyapatite deposition occurs spontaneously as a result of the structure of cartilage, not due to enzymatic/cellular action

### Epiphyseal Fusion

- When bone formation is complete via Endochondral Ossification
- Transverse Spicules/Bars of bone are formed across the lower portion of the Epiphyseal Growth Plate, which binds the Growth Plate to the Bone Shaft (Epiphyseal Fusion)
- The upper cartilaginous portion of the Growth Plate then atrophies, preventing further growth of the bone (it has reached its final level)

# Abnormal Bone Growth

1. Too little growth
2. Too much growth
3. Problems with ossification
- Trabecular Organisation of Bone ensures it is lightweight and strong
- the bone structure alters according to the pattern of weight-bearing that it experiences, in order to optimise the tensile strength that it experiences

---

# Achondroplasia - Too Little Growth

- Most common disease of growth plate and major cause of
dwarfism.
- Inheritance is autosomal dominant
- 80% of cases are caused by new mutations of **FGF-3** gene, meaning that it often appears spontaneously and is not often genetically inherited.
- Homozygous infants normally die at birth or soon after from respiratory insufficiency due to small chest cavity.
- This is relatively common due to many Achondroplastic Dwarfs having children with other individuals with Achondroplasia, increasing the likelihood of recessive traits being expressed in offspring

### Morphological Features (Heterozygotes)

- Shortened proximal extremities and trunk of relatively normal
length.
- Large head, prominent forehead and depressed nasal root.
- Longevity, intelligence and reproductive status all normal.

### Growth Plate in Achondroplasia

- In Achondroplasia, the Growth Plate fuses prematurely, stunting the growth of the lone bone
- Epiphyseal plate is ↓ in thickness.
- Zones of proliferating cartilage are attenuated/reduced.
- Osteoclastic activity is inconspicuous, and interface between plate and metaphysis is often sealed by transverse bars of bone that prevent further endochondral ossification.
- As a result, bones are shortened.

### Histological Features

- Abnormal growth plates: zones of chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy are narrowed and disorganised, with clusters of large chondrocytes rather than columns.
- At base of growth plate, there is premature deposition of bone that seals plate and prevents further growth.
- Intramembranous bone formation is not disrupted, only endochondral ossification is.

# Osteogenesis Imperfecta

- Group of phenotypically related disorders.
- All caused by defects in type I collagen synthesis: mutations in genes that code for 𝛼1 and 𝛼2 chains.
- Mutations are usually point substitutions and more common ones are autosomal dominant.
- More severe lethal forms are autosomal recessive.
- Although bone formation is most obvious defect (brittle bone disease), joints, eyes, skin and teeth are affected as well.
- Impaired hearing, abnormal teeth and blue sclerae.
- In OI, Vertebral Bodies also appear H Shaped instead of Wedge-Shaped

### Morphology

- Spectrum of severity
- Type II is uniformly fatal *in utero* or perinatally, with multiple fractures occurring in utero.
- **Type I**: autosomal dominant, permits a normal lifespan but with ↑ fractures in childhood, blue sclera, hearing defects and small,misshapen teeth.
- Underlying pathology in all cases is too little bone.
- Usually diagnosed morphologically rather than Histologically
- Histologically, OI Type II → Trabecular Elements are small and deformed, causing marrow spaces to be large

# Cretinism/Congenital Hypothyroidism

- Thyroid Hormone is essential for growth
- Results from maternal iodine deficiency.
- Disproportionally short limbs.
- Large head due to delayed closure of fontanelles.
- Mental impairment
- They have a characteristic facial morphology - Hypertelorism (Wide set eyes), Long Philtrum (groove in upper lip between lip and nose), flattened nasal bridge, short nose, hypognathia (small jaw)

![Screenshot 2021-10-20 at 10.34.35.png](%5B045%5D%20Normal%20and%20Abnormal%20Bone%20Growth%20f9b6f5830cbc4b7ea234287dfdf14333/Screenshot_2021-10-20_at_10.34.35.png)

# Seckel Syndrome

- Also known as Bird-Headed/Primordial Dwarfism
- **Features**: microcephaly, receding forehead, prominent nose, downslanting palpebral fissures (outer corner of the eyes are turned downwards), Moderate/severe mental deficiency
- Can survive to old age.
- Autosomal recessive
- Mutation in gene encoding **axia-telangiectasia-related protein** (**ATR**) which maps to chromosome 3q22.1-q24.

---

# Acromegaly

- Results when anterior pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone after puberty.
- Acromegaly = excess in Growth Hormone in adults (after bone has fused) and Giantism = Excess in Growth Hormone in children (before bone has fused)
- Cause is > 90% an adenoma of the Pituitary Gland that produces Growth Hormone
- Cases are normally sporadic and not genetic (due to its neoplastic cause)

### Signs and Symptoms

1. Enlarged hands, mandible, brow and forehead protrusion, prognathism and malocclusion.
2. Visceral enlargement especially heart and kidneys.
- Cardiomegaly is associated with Cardiac Arrhythmias due to reduced ability to adequately perfuse the Left Ventricle when it has hypertrophied, often reducing an individual's life span
1. Vocal cord thickening
2. Macroglossia (Large Tongue - Producing slurred, heavy speech alongside Vocal Cord Thickening)
3. Carpal tunnel syndrome
4. Individuals are usually taller

---

# Giantism

- Growth hormone producing (**somatotrope**) adenoma of pituitary occurring **before epiphyseal fusion.**
- If uncorrected, it will lead to excessive growth, reducing life expectancy due to Cardiomegaly
- Treated with surgery or growth hormone inhibitors in order to control growth rate.
