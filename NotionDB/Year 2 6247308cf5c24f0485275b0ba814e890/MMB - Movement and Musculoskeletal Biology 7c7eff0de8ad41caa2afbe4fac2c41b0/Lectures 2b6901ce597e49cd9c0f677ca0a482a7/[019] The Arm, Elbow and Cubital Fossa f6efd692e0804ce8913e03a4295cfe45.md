# [019] The Arm, Elbow and Cubital Fossa

# Arm and Forearm

### Bones of the Arm

- The arm/brachium is the region between the shoulder and elbow joint
- The forearm/antebrachium is between the elbow joint and the wrist
- The arm is always referred to in the anatomical position
- The bones of the arm include the humerus as well as the proximal parts of the radius and ulna, as many muscles from the arm attach there
- Just as the axilla is the gateway between the neck and body and the arm, the cubital fossa, which is anterior to the elbow joint is the gateway between the arm and the forearm

---

# The Humerus

- Main bone of the Arm
- There is a diagonal/oblique line on the posterosuperior surface of the humerus
- Below that line, is the radial groove, the radial nerve and the deep artery of the arm/profunda brachii are found here
- Above the radial groove, is the attachment for the lateral head of the triceps muscle
- Below the radial groove, is the attachment for the medial head of the triceps muscle
- The line ends laterally as the deltoid tuberosity (roughened area - attachment site for deltoid) once it has spiralled around the humerus
- As you get to the end of the humerus, it flairs out to form medial and lateral epicondyles which can be palpated as sharp points on either side of the below
- Above the lateral and medial epicondyles, there are the lateral and medial supraepicondylar ridges found at the boundary between the epicondyles and the shafts (where the Humerus flairs out to form the Epicondyles)
- These are where the flexors and extensors of the wrist and fingers (muscles of the forearm) originate from, either the epicondyles or the supraepicondylar ridges
- The humerus ends in the articulation for the elbow
    
    There are two articulations/condyles:
    
    1. Medially, there is the much larger trochlea. This actually extends/continues onto the posterior surface of the humerus and articulates with the Ulna
    2. Laterally, there is the smaller capitulum which does not extend onto the back of the humerus. This articulates with the radius
    - There some “caves” above the articulations of the elbow. These fossae accommodate projections of the radius and ulna during flexion and extension of the elbow:
    1. The radial fossa is on the anterior surface of the humerus and above the capitulum. This is for projection/head of the radius
    2. The coronoid fossa is on the anterior surface of the humerus, above the trochlea. This is for the projection of the ulna
    3. The largest and deepest fossa is the olecranon which is on the posterior surface of the humerus and is between both epicondyles and superior to the posterior projection of the Trochlea. This is for the Olecranon process of the Ulna
    - The entire arm is enveloped and surrounded by a deep fascia
    - This fascia sends out intermuscular septa, that attach to the medial and lateral edges of the humerus
    - The humerus and the intermuscular septa divide the arm into anterior and posterior compartments

    ### Fractures of the Humerus
    
    - Fractures can occur at the shaft of the Humerus - How the arm deforms/how the bone displaces due to these fractures, depends on whether the fractures occur below or above the insertion of the deltoid muscle on the Deltoid Tuberosity of the Humerus (The deltoid inserts laterally onto the humerus)
        - For fractures above the deltoid insertion:
        1) The upper part of the humerus tends to deform/displace inwards or medially, as the rotator cuff muscles are pulling it in
        2) The lower part humerus is being pulled outwards/laterally by the deltoid
        - For fractures below the deltoid insertion:
        1) This is far more common
        2) The deltoid pulls the proximal end of the humerus out laterally, with the lower part being displaced inwards/medially

# The Proximal Radius and Ulna

- These lie within the forearm
- In the anatomical position, the radius is the lateral bone (on the side of the thumb) whilst the ulnar is the medial bone (on the side of the pinkie)
- Proximally, at the elbow joint, the radius is much smaller than the ulna
- This is reversed at the wrist
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_21.52.13.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_21.52.13.png)
    

### The Proximal Radius

- The radius has a disc-shaped head proximally which articulates with the capitulum of the Humerus and the radial notch of the Ulna
- The head is followed by a constricted neck
- There is a very prominent radial tuberosity which is located on the anteromedial surface of the radius
- The tendon of biceps brachii inserts here
- There is an oblique line that crosses the anterior surface of the radius from the radial tuberosity, inferolaterally down the shaft of the Radius
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_21.53.24.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_21.53.24.png)
    
    ### The Proximal Ulna
    
    - The proximal end of the ulna is much larger and more complex in shape than the proximal end of the humerus
    - It is dominated by a large process called the olecranon process, found posterior to the Trochlear Notch, Coronoid Process and Radial Notch.
    - It is roughened for the attachment of Triceps Brachii
    - The olecranon forms the tip of the elbow
    - There is a coronoid process anterior to the Olecranon Process, with the indentation between the Coronoid and Olecranon processes forming the Very Large Trochlear Notch on the Anterior Surface of the Humerus
    - The trochlear notch of the ulna articulates with the trochlea of the humerus
    - The trochlear notch cups the end of the humerus around the back as well as front
    - There is also a small radial notch on the lateral side of the head of the ulna
    - This accommodates the head of the radius
    - The disc-shaped head of the radius articulates with the capitulum but can spin against the radial notch
    - This is what promotes the pronation and supination of the forearm
    - The ulnar tuberosity on the anterior surface of the ulna is where the tendon for the brachialis muscle inserts
    - The front aspect of the trochlear notch is the coronoid process.
    - During flexion of the elbow this goes into the coronoid fossa of the humerus

# The Elbow Joint

- The Elbow Joint (Hinge Synovial Joint) is formed by 3 separate articulations:
1. The trochlear notch of the ulna articulates with the trochlea of the humerus (Humeroulnar Joint)
2. The head of the radius articulates with the capitulum of the humerus (Humeroradial Joint)
3. The head of the radius also articulates with the radial notch of the ulna (Superior Radioulnar Joint)
- Movements possible at the elbow joint:
1) Flexion and extension (Involving the Humeroulnar and Humeroradial Joints predominantly)
2) Pronation and supination - This involves the disc-shaped head of the radius
spinning against the radial notch of the ulna, with the distal part of the radius crossing superficially over the Ulna during pronation
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_21.58.00.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_21.58.00.png)
    
- The elbow joint is a synovial joint and is therefore surrounded by a synovial membrane which surrounds the joint and head of radius
- This forms a sacciform recess surrounding the head of the radius
- Between the synovial membrane and the more superficial fibrous membrane, there are fat pads filling the fossae (Capitulum and Trochlea) in the humerus
- The fossae accommodate the different projections of the radius and ulna during flexion and extension
- The fibrous membrane that surrounds the synovial membrane is strengthened in a couple of places (medially and laterally) by collateral ligaments:
1) Medially, there is the ulnar collateral ligament
2) Laterally, there is the radial collateral ligament
- There is also an annular or ring ligament that surrounds the disc-shaped head of the radius
- This allows the head of the radius to spin against the ulna during pronation/supination
    - The Elbow Joint receives innervation from the Musculocutaneous, Median, Radial and Ulnar Nerves

- This is in the anterior view
- Medial and Lateral Epicondyle can be distinguished from one another as the Medial Epicondyle projects out more than the Lateral Epicondyle
- This shows that during extension, the olecranon process of the ulna goes behind the humerus in the Olecranon Fossa
- The ulna articulates with the humerus at the trochlea and the coronoid process of the ulna is visible as a medial projection of the Ulna
    - The disc-shaped head of the radius articulates with the capitulum and the radial tuberosity is also visible
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_22.04.14.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_22.04.14.png)

# Injury to and Pathologies of the Elbow

### Pulled Elbow

- It is possible for the disc-shaped head of the radius to slip out of the annular ligament, resulting in a partially dislocated elbow
- This is called a pulled elbow/nursemaid's elbow and is most common in children due to the shape of the annular ligament
- In adults, the walls of the annular ligament are more funnel-shaped/oblique and it tends to cup the head of the radius much better
- In children, the walls of the annular ligament tend to be more vertical and hence, looser around the head of the radius, so it is much easier for the head of the radius to be pulled out following a sudden, powerful pull of the arm
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_22.07.24.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_22.07.24.png)
    

### Supracondylar Fracture

- This is also more common in children than adults
- This is the fracture of the humerus above the lateral and medial epicondyles of the humerus.
- It is graded based upon its severity of whether there is a fracture resulting in the two ends of the humerus still being aligned or if they are displaced, if the ends are angled or if there is a complete break and it has been displaced.
- The angle between and degree of displacement between the proximal and broken distal portion of the Humerus is used to grade the fracture. The degree of angulation and displacement can be used to assess severity as the distal humerus articulates with the Ulna, where the Triceps Brachii attaches and tends to pull the Radius, Ulna and Humerus distal to the fracture posteriorly.
- Many vessels and nerves are found in this area and hence, are at risk of damage during a fracture. Most importantly, the main artery of the arm, the brachial artery, passes in front of the elbow joint down the humerus
- There is a danger, particularly in the more severe types of fractures (Type II and III) that the brachial artery will be bow-strung over the broken edge of the humerus, where it can be lacerated
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_22.09.30.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_22.09.30.png)
    
    ### Epicondylitis
    
    - This is seen in adults due to overuse and a lot of repetitive strain of either the flexor or extensor muscles of the forearm
    - These muscles act to flex and/or extend the wrist and fingers
    - They are largely in the forearm and originate off the lateral and medial epicondyles as well as the supraepicondylar ridges
    - Overuse of these muscles and subsequently repetitive strain elbows results in epicondylitis, which results in inflammation of the muscles and their common flexor tendons
    - If it is of the flexor muscles (muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm), which come off the medial epicondyle, it is often known as golfer’s elbow or thrower’s elbow
    - If it is of the extensors, which come off the lateral epicondyle, this is usually known as tennis elbow

# Muscles of the Anterior Arm

- There are only three muscles of the anterior compartment of the
arm:
1) Biceps is the most superficial
2) Coracobrachialis is deep to this
3) Deep to these two is brachialis
- All muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm are innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve (C5 – C7) which comes off the lateral cord of the brachial plexus
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_22.11.46.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_22.11.46.png)
    
    ### Biceps Brachii (Already Covered Briefly)
    
    - This is the largest and most superficial muscle of the anterior compartment of the arm
    - It is the only anterior muscle of the arm that crosses both the shoulder and elbow joint
    - The biceps has two heads:
    1) The short head comes off the coracoid process of the scapula
    2) The long head goes through the bicipital groove between the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus and then inserts onto the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula
    - The two heads combine into a single muscle belly, and cross the elbow to insert onto the radial tuberosity of the radius
    - Biceps Brachii throws out an aponeurosis from its tendon that projects medially (Bicipital Aponeurosis)
    - As it crosses both joints, the biceps can flex the arm (weak), forearm (strong - via elbow joint) and is the most powerful supinator (palm facing upwards) of the arm
    - This is why the arm is much more powerful in supination than it is in pronation as Biceps Brachii is much larger and more powerful than muscles that produce pronation
    - This is why right-handed people tend to be at an advantage when they use corkscrews or screwdrivers (as right-handed people use supination movements to utilise these tools)
        - Biceps Brachii is the most powerful supinator when the arm is flexed to some degree. If the arm is fully extended, Biceps Brachii cannot work as a Supinator, with Supination here being due to the action of Supinator (it is much smaller and weaker than biceps however)

    ### Popeye Muscle
    
    - It is possible that a tendon for one of the heads of biceps may partially or completely tear due to overuse of the muscle or lifting an extremely heavy load
    - This is always almost the long head, as tears of the short head are extremely rare
    - This results in the muscle becoming partly detached at its origin, resulting in a hugely exaggerated bulge of the bicep when the patient flexes their arm
    - This is informally known as a Popeye muscle

- All the Muscles in the Posterior compartment of the Arm/Brachium and Forearm/Antebrachium are innervated by the Radial Nerve (C6-C8 but predominantly C8)

# Movements at the Elbow

- Movements at the elbow can be used to test different myotomes:
- Flexion of the elbow can be used as a test of the C6 myotome (with some C5)
- Extension of the elbow can be used as a test of the C7 myotome

# Arteries of the Arm and Forearm

### Arterial Supply of the Arm/Brachium

- The primary artery is the brachial artery which is a continuation of the axillary artery once it gets below the edge of latissimus dorsi and teres major
- It starts medial to the Humerus but descends inferolaterally to cross onto the anterior surface of the arm, with it being anteromedially positioned within the arm at the level of the elbow joint
- The brachial artery supplies the muscles of the anterior compartment of the Arm has three big branches in the arm:

### 1) Profunda Brachii/Deep Artery of the Arm

- The Brachial Artery throws this artery just below the level of latissimus dorsi and teres major
- This passes through the triangular interval with the radial nerve and both of them go through the radial groove, right around the back of the humerus where it supplies the posterior compartment of the Arm
- They are quite susceptible here, as they are in the groove and tightly packed between the lateral and medial heads of triceps, so if there is a fracture of the humerus, both of them are at risk of being disrupted
- This throws off a middle collateral artery as well as a radial collateral artery (2 terminal arteries) which contribute to this rich vascular network/anastamosis around the elbow joint, alongside recurrent arteries which branch distal to the Elbow joint and travel more proximally to contribute to the anastamosis

### 2) Superior Ulnar Collateral Artery

- This artery is also given off fairly high up, just inferior to where the Profunda Brachii arises
- This then runs down and forms part of the anastomosis around the elbow

### 3) Inferior Ulnar Collateral Artery

- This artery is given off just below the elbow joint
- This contributes to the vascular network around the elbow
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_22.48.22.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-04_at_22.48.22.png)
    
- The Brachial Artery crosses in front of the elbow joint, through the cubital fossa and
then usually divides into two terminal branches distal to the Cubital Fossa, the radial (More lateral) and ulnar arteries (More Medial), which go laterally and medially respectively
- That division will sometimes occur within the cubital fossa. Rarely, it can occur higher up. This has clinical implications as it may result in accidental puncture during venepuncture

### Arterial Supply for the Forearm/Antebrachium

- As with the shoulder joint, during a wide range of movements and contraction of different muscles, the rich vascular network around the elbow joint allows bloodflow to continue unhindered from many redundant sources to the elbow joint.
- This includes recurrent branches that are coming up (travel proximally) from below/distal the elbow joint alongside the Middle and Collateral Arteries from the Profunda Brachii

# Veins of the Arm and Forearm

### Venous Drainage of the Arm/Brachium

- There are two paired brachial veins (Venae Comitantes) which are deep and accompany the brachial artery deep in the anterior compartment of the arm. These drain into the Basilic Vein
- There are also two superficial veins:
1. Running along the medial aspect of the arm (along the medial border of Biceps Brachii), there is the basilic vein that pierces the deep fascia of the arm and receives branches from the deep brachial veins. As it goes above the level of latissimus dorsi it becomes the axillary vein, as it gets over the first rib it becomes the subclavian vein
2. The cephalic vein runs along the lateral aspect of the arm (along the lateral border of Biceps Brachii , between deltoid and pectoralis major in the deltopectoral groove, just superficial to the skin. Once it travels over pectoralis minor it tends to dive deep through the fascia and joins the axillary vein

# Nerves of the Arm

There are four terminal nerves of the brachial plexus that run down the arm:

### 1) Musculocutaneous Nerve (C5-C7):

- This is a branch of the lateral cord and the main nerve of the anterior compartment of the arm
- It firstly goes through and innervates coracobrachialis and passes in the plane between biceps and brachialis
- It innervates all three of these muscles
- It ends as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm which is a sensory nerve of the forearm (the lateral side of the forearm)

### 2) Median Nerve (C5-T1)

- It is formed by a combination of the lateral and medial cords
- It accompanies the brachial artery all the way through the arm and into the cubital fossa, anterior to the elbow joint in the anterior compartment
- It has no major branches in the arm

### 3) Ulnar Nerve (C7-T1)

- This is a branch of the medial cord
- This accompanies the brachial artery initially, travelling medially to it (most medial nerve of the forearm)
- Halfway down the arm, it diverges away from the Brachial Artery, enters the posterior compartment and passes/loops around the posterior surface of the medial epicondyle of the humerus as it descends (where it is very superficial)
- Where the Ulnar Nerve passes posteriorly to the Medial Epicondyle, It is palpable and vulnerable to injury. This is the nerve hit in the sensation upon “hitting your funny bone”
- It has no major branches in the arm

### 4) Radial Nerve (C5-T1)

- This is the only nerve of the arm that travels in the Posterior Compartment of the Arm, Innervating the Triceps Brachii and the Lateral Portion of Brachialis
- It is a continuation of the Posterior Cord and initially follows Profunda Brachii/the deep artery of the arm into the Posterior Compartment through the triangular interval, and then through the radial groove and between the lateral and medial heads of triceps
- Laterally, the radial nerve enters the anterior compartment of the arm, crossing the elbow joint anterior to the Lateral Epicondyle of the Humerus
- It throws off 2 cutaneous nerves in the Posterior Compartment (Inferior Lateral Cutaneous Nerve of Arm and Posterior Cutaneous Nerve of Forearm) and then swings back in front of the elbow joint by passing through the Lateral Intermuscular Septum to enter the Anterior Compartment between the Brachalis and Brachioradialis Muscles
- It does not pass through the cubital fossa but goes lateral to it, beneath brachioradialis

# Nerve Injuries

- A fracture of the shaft of the humerus could potentially endanger the radial nerve as it is packed close within the radial groove and between the lateral and medial head of triceps and so can get stretched or torn
- The ulnar nerve is extremely superficial and prone to injury when it passes posteriorly around the medial epicondyle (can be compressed against the Humerus or against muscles). If it is struck or if the flexor muscles of the anterior compartment of the forearm become inflamed it can result in compression/impingement of the nerve

# Antecubital/Cubital Fossa

- This is the gateway between the arm and forearm
- It is a roughly triangular space, anterior to the elbow joint
- The base of the triangle/superior border is an imaginary line between the lateral and medial epicondyles of the humerus
- The lateral boundary is formed by brachioradialis one of the muscles of the forearm
- It comes off the lateral supraepicondylar ridge of the humerus and loops down to form the lateral margin of the triangle
- The medial margin is formed by pronator teres, another muscle of the forearm
- It comes off the medial epicondyle
- The floor is formed by the brachialis muscle (proximal to its insertion) which inserts into the ulnar tuberosity and to a lesser extent by supinator
- The roof of the cubital fossa is formed by skin and deep fascia
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_11.27.46.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_11.27.46.png)
    
- It contains three things of note:
1. The tendon of biceps brachii which inserts onto the radial tuberosity
2. The brachial artery
3. The median nerve
- Arranged lateral to medial, the order is tendon, artery and then nerve (TAN)

### Clinical Importance of the Cubital Fossa

- The biceps throws off the bicipital aponeurosis, which projects medially and is incredibly useful clinically in venepuncture (drawing blood):
- It lies above the brachial artery and median nerve
- Superficial to the bicipital aponeurosis there is a network of superficial veins
- Superficial to the bicipital aponeurosis there is a connection between the basilic (medial) and cephalic (lateral) vein called the Median Cubital vein
- The median cubital vein is very commonly used in venepuncture as it is very superficial, it is easy to locate and as it lies superficial to the Bicipital Aponeurosis, this aponeurosis protects the deeper brachial artery and median nerve below from damage during the procedure

- The cubital fossa is also often where blood pressure is measured:
- This is done by placing a cuff higher up in the arm, which compresses the brachial artery against the humerus
- A stethoscope is placed on top of the brachial artery, in the cubital fossa in order to measure blood pressure
- The stethoscope should be placed just medial to the tendon of biceps brachii which can be palpated in the cubital fossa

- Here it is clear that the image is high up in the arm as it is not fully detached from the body/trunk yet
- This is a T1 weighted MRI section
- There is a neurovascular bundle coming from the axilla
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_11.39.26.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_11.39.26.png)
    
- This is clearly lower down as the arm is detached from the
trunk
- The deep artery and radial nerve have begun to move around the back of the humerus
- The neurovascular bundle containing the brachial artery and veins, median nerve, ulnar nerve and basilic vein courses down the arm
    
    ![%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_11.41.57.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Arm,%20Elbow%20and%20Cubital%20Fossa%20f6efd692e0804ce8913e03a4295cfe45/Screenshot_2021-07-05_at_11.41.57.png)
    
- Even further down, the triceps begins to flatten into a single belly to form its insertion tendon
- It is clear that the MRI is lower down as the humerus is more flattened
- The brachial artery and median nerve are diving between biceps and brachialis
- The basilic vein is visible in the superficial fascia medially
