# [002] Muscles and Movement

# Musculoskeletal System

### Skeletal System

- It is composed of bones, cartilage, joints
1. It provides protection and support for organs
2. It allows body movements
3. It produces blood cells
4. It stores minerals and fat

### Muscular System

- Comprised of muscles attached to skeletal system
1. Produces overt body movement via muscular contraction/relaxation
2. Maintains posture/body position and balance against influence of gravity
- The maintenance of Body Posture ensures that there is a stable muscular base/position upon which voluntary movements can be carried out without compromising the body's stability.
- Posture = Stable body position (regardless of whether it is relatively 'good' or 'bad')
- The Muscular System allows a stable body position/posture to be maintained against the influence of gravity (it counters the effects of gravity on body posture often via compensatory limb movements).
- E.g when standing, the muscles of the lower limb are contracted to generate an upward force that counters the weight of the body
- This is regulated by the Vestibular System of the Inner Ear (detects changes in Head Position)
1. Generates body heat

# How do we move?

- Muscle contracts and subsequently, pulls on bone
- Moveable joints between bones allows movement of the bones relative to one another
- Joints constrain the range of movements possible and vary in the degree of movement they allow (some allow little movement at all or constrain the plane of movement)
- All joints to some extent, limit the amplitude/magnitude of movement possible by bones

# Joints

1. Fibrous joints: Bones linked by fibrous connective tissue, permitting little to no movement (e.g. sutures in cranium)
2. Cartilaginous joints: Bones linked by hyaline cartilage or fibrocartilage. The elasticity of the cartilage allows some movement but this is limited (e.g. pubic symphysis)
3. Synovial joints: Joints enclosed by a fluid filled synovial capsule. These allow considerable movement between the articulating bones.

---

# Types of Synovial Joints

- Plane joint: Joint between 2 flat articulating surfaces that can slide against one another. It allows slight movement in one plane (e.g. intervertebral)

- Saddle joint: Joint between 2 articular surfaces that are curved along 2 axis. It permits biaxial movement (e.g. carpometacarpal pollicis)

- Hinge joint: Joint between 2 complementarily curved articular surfaces. Allows for Uniaxial movement (elbow) - Usually around the long axis of the convex articular surface

- Pivot: Formed by a cylinder running from one bone, through a depression in another. It allows rotational movement (e.g. proximal radioulnar)
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-08-31 at 17.17.30.png](%5B002%5D%20Muscles%20and%20Movement%204467c248e88840a1a5a355f0e5d3992b/Screenshot_2021-08-31_at_17.17.30.png)
    
- Ball and socket: multiple axis movement in all axis (e.g. humeral (shoulder)), as well as some rotational movement (maximum freedom of movement possible)
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-08-31 at 17.21.35.png](%5B002%5D%20Muscles%20and%20Movement%204467c248e88840a1a5a355f0e5d3992b/Screenshot_2021-08-31_at_17.21.35.png)
    
- Ellipsoid: movement is biaxial (e.g. atlantooccipital), can be mostly uniaxial (metacarpophalangeal) or multiaxial (radiocarpal) depending on the specific shapes of the articular surfaces. Can produce similar movements to the Saddle Joint but both surfaces are concave and convex meaning the movements produced are less constrained

# Anatomical Movements

- Flexion =
1. Closing or ↓ joint angle (elbow, knee)
2. Movement going anteriorly in the sagittal plane (shoulder, neck, trunk), anterior to the coronal plane. 
- Both movements of the foot in the Sagittal Plane are classed as flexion
1. Movement of the foot towards plantar surface/inferiorly (plantar flexion (foot and toes)) (when standing on pin). Towards shin/superiorly (dorsiflexion (foot and toes)).
- Extension =
1. Opening or ↑ joint angle (elbow, knee)
2. Movement going posteriorly in the sagittal plane (shoulder, neck, trunk), posterior to the sagittal plane.

- Abduction: Movement that takes the body part from its resting position away (in anatomical position) from midline (arm) or from the midline and each other (fingers).
- Adduction: Movement that takes the body part towards the midline/resting position (arm) or towards the midline and each other (fingers)
- These both occur in the Coronal Plane
- Rotation: Movement around the long axis of structure (lateral or medial rotation dependent on whether rotation is away from or towards midline).
- Pronation: rotation of the palm until it faces posteriorly, causing the radius and ulna to cross.
- Supination: rotation of the palm until it faces anteriorly, meaning th e radius and ulna are uncrossed.
- Circumduction: Combination of flexion, extension, abduction and adduction (producing a circular movement) - Commonly seen at Ball and Socket Joints (freely moveable joints).
- Dysdiadochokinesia: inability to produce rapid alterations of position (alternating movements) due to injury to cerebellum. Commonly tested by asking Px to rapidly pronate and supinate forearm

# Muscles

- When activated, muscles contract but do not always shorten.
- Muscle length and whether muscles shorten upon activation depends on the level of activation and the magnitude of the load upon it/at the joint
- When muscles contract, they always generate force at a joint but the contractions that occur can be Isotonic or Isometric

**Isotonic (equal force) Contraction - Muscle Shortens:**

- The force (tension) generated by muscle contraction is greater than the magnitude of the load so muscle shortens (during which, the tension in the muscle remains constant). Load is raised against gravity/load is moved (movement occurs at the joint as sufficient tension is generated by the muscle to produce a resultant force and movement)

**Isometric (equal distance) Contraction - Muscle doesn't shorten:**

- Force (tension) generated by muscle contraction is < magnitude of the load so muscle cannot shorten. Load is not raised against gravity (no movement at the joint as there is insufficient tension generated by the muscle to produce a resultant force and movement).
- Muscle may ‘shorten’ during an isometric contraction due to elasticity of tendons

# Composition of Muscles

- Muscle → fascicle → muscle fibre → myofibrils → thin (actin) and
thick (myosin) filaments (sarcomere)
- Force is generated by cross-bridge formation Actin and Myosin within Sarcomere according to the Sliding Filament Mechanism
- The Arrangement and Overlap of Actin and Myosin within a Sarcomere produces banding patterns when seen under Interference Light Microscopy alongside Z line (attaches Adjacent Actin filaments to one another) and M lines (attaches Adjacent Myosin Filaments to one another).
- A Band = Length of Sarcomere where Myosin filament is found (length of Myosin filament)
- I Band = Length of Sarcomere where Myosin filament is not found (only actin is found)

# Sliding Filament Theory

- Myosin complex consists of a linear body and an angled, round head (looks like Music Note).
- The Angle of the Myosin head can be changed via ATP Hydrolysis to increase the angle between the Head and the Linear Body into the Cocked State.
- In the Cocked State, the Myosin Head can bind to the Actin-Tropomyosin Complex (Thin Filament) and when Ca²⁺ is present, the energy stored in the Cocked Myosin head can be released.
- This energy release causes the Myosin Head to flick back to its resting state and in turn, pulling the Thin filament towards the M line relative to the Myosin

# Muscle Activation

- Muscles are excitable tissue that receive inputs from motor neurons of spinal cord (majority) or brainstem via Cranial Nerves (for muscles in head).
- These inputs terminate on the Neuromuscular Junctions on individual muscle fibres
- Each motor neuron controls the contraction of/synapses on several muscle fibres.
- Motor unit = motor neuron and the associated muscle fibres that it synapses with/controls
- Large motor unit (Motor Neuron synapses with lots of muscle fibres) can generate high forces as the activation of a single motor neuron can cause lots of muscle fibres to contract, generating high force levels/tension.
- Small motor unit with fewer muscle fibres (Motor Neuron synapses with few muscle fibres) causes few muscle fibres to contract and hence, generates lower force levels, even when fully activated
- To gradually ↑ strength of contraction, small motor unit are initially activated, with larger motor units then being recruited as needed until all motor units associated with a muscle are recruited and maximum force is generated.
- Smaller Motor Units are activated before Larger Motor Units as when trying to generate a muscle contraction, the neural input stimulates the entire motor pool for a specific muscle.
- As smaller motor units contain smaller motor neurons (which are easier to activate), these are activated with weaker control signals into the Motor pool whilst larger motor units are not.
- When stronger contractions are needed, the strength of the command input into the Motor Pool also increases, allowing for the activation of increasingly larger motor units (alongside smaller motor units) to generate the required muscle tension
- A higher force can be generated by rate coding: ↑ firing of motoneurons = ↑ muscle contraction = ↑ force generated

# Length-Tension Curves

- The Maximum tension that a muscle can generate upon contraction/stimulation (via Sliding Filament) depends on an optimal interaction between thick and thin filaments as well as the strength of the input into the muscle from motor neurons.
- This depends on degree of overlap at different sarcomere lengths, giving rise to length tension curves:
- Actin-Myosin crossbridges can only be formed in regions of the Sarcomere where the Actin and Myosin filaments overlap
- When muscle is extremely stretched, there is very little overlap between actin (thin filament) and myosin (thick filament), so very little force/tension can be generated as fewer cross-bridges can form upon stimulation.
- As actin and myosin overlap and initial muscle length decreases, there is a greater degree of overlap between the actin and myosin filaments. This means that more cross-bridges can form and a can be greater contraction can occur, so force/tension ↑.
- As the muscle continues to contracts after a certain point, the thick/actin filaments begin to overlap near the M line (where there are no myosin heads).
- This reduces the length of the region of the Sarcomere where the Thin filament can slide over/relative to the Thick Filament.
- This also reduces the length of the region where Myosin heads can bind to Actin and hence, where Cross Bridges can form.
- Hence, fewer cross-bridges and less movement of Actin relative to Myosin can form in this smaller region, causing the force/tension generated to decrease
- A muscle can generate its maximum tension towards the middle of its sarcomere length range (where there is optimum Actin-Myosin overlap with no Actin-Actin overlap) and much less when it is too long and too short
- The force generated by a given input from a motor neuron depends on the existing/resting length of the muscle, the magnitude of the motor command from motor neurons and the velocity of shortening.
- Hence, the Nervous System must know the existing length of a muscle fibre so that a neural input of a sufficient magnitude can be given to and from motor neurons to ensure that the right muscle tension is generated, regardless of the initial length/extension of the muscle fibre.

# Problems for Accurate Control of Muscles

- Agonist = Muscle that contracts to produce desired movement. Antagonist = Muscle that contracts to produce a movement in the opposite direction to the one that is desired.
- Muscles are not simple, linear transducers. For a given motor command down a specific motor neuron, the force/tension that will be subsequently generated depends upon the existing length of the muscle fibre and their velocity of shortening.
- Muscles have elastic and viscous properties which make them relatively stretchy and resistant to rapid stretches, which motor commands must take into account to generate the required muscle force/tension.
- Muscles are usually arranged as agonists and antagonists which are around and act on a joint to increase the accuracy of movements that can be produce.
- This means that net movement around a joint will depend on the load on the joint and the resultant force produced by all the muscles (agonist and antagonist) around the joint.
- Muscles can become injured or diseased, leading to ↓ ability to generate force at a specific quantity of neural input.
- These problems are solved by Proprioception (feedback which allows for accurate motor control)

---

# Proprioception - Feedback for Control System

- Length and tension information are key types of feedback information for accurate control of movement (controlling the magnitude of motor input required to produce a specific muscle tension) and are monitored via:
1. Muscle spindle - These receptors are found within muscles found and detect changes in the length (specifically stretch) of force-generating fibres within the muscle.
2. Golgi tendon organ: detects changes in muscle tension/force. These are found in the tendons of the contracting muscles (in series) and detect the tendon here

# 3 Types of Movements

1. Reflexive: spinal cord and brainstem
2. Rhythmic: Arise from Central Pattern Generators (spinal cord and brainstem) - Repetitive sequence of movements
- e.g. walking - normal gait and running (Includes muscle contraction of lower limbs to produce walking movement and of core muscles around the vertebrla column and pelvis to maintain a stable upright body posture and balance)
1. Voluntary: Arise from motor cortex; e.g. reaching, grasping, point-of-interest changes/rapidly shifting gase by saccadic eye movements (rapid eye movements) - most accurate and precise class of movement with an extremely wide variety/range of voluntary movements possible
