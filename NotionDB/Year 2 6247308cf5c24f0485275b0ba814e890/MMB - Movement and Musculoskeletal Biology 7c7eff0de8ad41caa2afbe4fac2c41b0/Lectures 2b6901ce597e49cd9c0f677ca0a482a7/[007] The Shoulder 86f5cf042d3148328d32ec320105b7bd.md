# [007] The Shoulder

# Overview

- Shoulder = Area that attaches Arm to Trunk
- Arm = Between shoulder and elbow joint
- Forearm = Between elbow joint and Wrist
- Hand = Distal to Wrist

# Evolution of the Pectoral Girdle

- Shoulder Girdle = Clavicle, Scapula and Humerus, bound to the trunk by muscles and Ligaments. The Clavicle is the single bony connection between the trunk and the remainder of the Pectoral Girdle.
- The upright posture of humans has meant that compared to other mammals, the trunk has been compressed to reduce its anteroposterior diameter, pushing the scapula more posteriorly so it projects posteromedially/obliquely vs posteriorly, and subsequently elongating the clavicle.

# The Clavicle

- Rod-like 's' shaped bone that can be palpated along its entire length anteriorly
- Articulates with the clavicular notch of manubrium of the sternum and first costal cartillage medially and laterally to the Acromium of the Scapula
- Conoid Tubercle - Small projection from the posteroinferior surface of the lateral end of the Clavicle. This is the attachment site for the Conoid Ligament.
- The Clavicle contains many other roughened areas which serve as attachment sites for other muscles and ligaments

# The Scapula

- Roughly triangular-shaped bone, with medial, lateral and superior borders. It also has superior, inferior and lateral angles (Lateral Angle = Glenoid). The Superior Angle is found posteriorly to the Clavicle
- Posterior surface of the scapula is marked by an Oblique Spine (Runs Superolaterally from Lateral Border to end as Acromion Process, which is relatively flat + curved and rectangular in shape). These two structures can be palpated posteriorly (Acromion Process palpated as 'tip' of Shoulder AKA most superolateral point on shoulder when palpated on Posterior surface).
- The Spine divides the posterior surface of the Scapula into the Supraspinous and Infraspinous Fossae, dependent on whether the fossae are superior or inferior to the spine respectively.
- Coracoid Process - Found anteroinferiorly to Acromion. Hook-Shaped (Looks like Bent Finger) process. This can be palpated inferior to the Clavicle on the anterior surface of the body
- 3 Fossae/Depressions can be found on the surface of the Scapula, which act as attachment sites for the Rotator Cuff Muscles:
1. Subscapular Fossa - Found on the Anterior surface of the Scapula
2. Supraspinous Fossa - Found on the Posterior surface of the Scapula, Superior to the Spine
3. Infraspinous Fossa - Found on the Posterior Surface of the Scapula, Inferior to the Spine
- The Glenoid (Pear-Shaped indentation on Lateral edge of the Scapula) contains 2 tubercles:
1. Supraglenoid Tubercle (Found Superior to the Glenoid) - Attachment site for the tendon of the Long Head of the Biceps
2. Infraglenoid Tubercle (Found Inferior to the Glenoid) - Attachment site for the tendon of the Long Head of the Triceps
- Suprascapular Notch - Small Indentation found between the Coracoid Process and the Superior Border of the Scapula. This is spanned by a transverse ligament, under which passes the Suprascapular Nerve and over which passes the Suprascapular Vessels
- Greater Scapula Notch - Found under the Spine and Acromion Process on the Posterior Surface of the Scapula. Both the Suprascapular Nerve and Vessels pass through this Notch
- Coracoid process found anteriorly to Glenoid/Lateral Angle and Acromion process is found Posteriorly to Glenoid/Lateral Angle

# The Proximal Humerus

- Long bone of the arm
- Large Hemispherical Head which articulates with the Glenoid of the Scapula to form the Glenohumeral Joint (Shoulder Joint Proper)
- Immediately distal to the head, the Anatomical Neck is found (Projects Obliquely superomedially along the inferior border of the Head). This is extremely thick and hence, rarely fractures.
- On the Anterior Surface of the Humerus (Just below the Anatomical Neck), two tubercles can be found:
1. Greater Tubercle - Found Laterally
2. Lesser Tubercle - Found Anteriorly and More Medially.
- Between the two tubercles, the Biciptal Groove/Intertubercular Sulcus can be found. Within this groove runs the Tendon of the Long Head of Biceps. The Rim and Floor of the Biciptal Groove serve as important muscular attachment sites
- Inferior to the Tubercles, the Surgical Neck of the Humerus can be found, where there is constriction/narrowing between the head of the Humerus and the shaft. This is a common area of fracture.
- Along the Posterior Surface of the Humerus, there is a spiral/oblique line that runs inferolaterally from just inferior to the head of the Humerus. This is the attachment site for the Lateral Head of the Triceps.
- Inferior to this Spiral Line is the Radial Groove, through which the Radial Nerve and Deep Artery of the Arm runs.
- The Radial Groove and the ridge above it are continuous laterally with the Roughened Deltoid Tuberosity on the anterolateral surface of the Humerus, onto which the Deltoid Attaches.
- Directly medial to the Deltoid Tuberosity, there is a roughened area that acts as the attachment site for the Coracobracialis
- Fractures/Breaks of the Surgical Neck of the Humerus can injure the closely associated Axillary Nerve and Posterior Circumflex Humeral Artery.

# Joints of the Shoulder

- 3 Bones and 3 Joints comprise the Pectoral Girdle:

### 1) Sternoclavicular Joint

- Between Manubrium of the Sternum + First Costal Cartilage and the Clavicle
- Synovial Joint that allows for movement in the Sagittal Plane (Anteriorly and Posteriorly) as well as vertical and rotational movement of the Clavicle

Reinforced by:

1. Anterior and Posterior Sternoclavicular Ligaments (Found anteriorly and posteriorly to the Joint, attached to both the Manubrium and Clavicle to surround the Joint)
2. Costoclavicular Ligament - Between First Rib + First Costal Cartilage and the Clavicle
3. Interclavicular Ligament - Between the Medial ends of both clavicles
    
    ![%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_15.52.53.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_15.52.53.png)
    

### 2) Acromioclavicular Joint

- Between the Clavicle and the Acromion Process of the Scapula
- Synovial Joint that is important for weight-bearing

Reinforced by:

1. Acromioclavicular Ligament - Between the Acromion Process and Clavicle (Surrounds Joint)
2. Coracoclavicular Ligament - Between Coracoid Process and Clavicle
    
    ![%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.00.57.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.00.57.png)
    
- Strong, Medially directed forces on the arms can lead to Shoulder Separation injuries which can dislocate the Acromioclavicular Joint. There are 3 different Types of Injury, classified by the degree of injury to the surrounding Ligaments (Whether + How many Ligaments are torn). Type 1 = Partial Tear of Acromioclavicular Ligament, Type 2 = Complete Tear of Acromioclavicular Ligament and Type III = Complete Tear of Acromioclavicular and Coracoclavicular Ligaments
- Type IV and V Injuries also exist but they are more severe than I-III
    
    ![%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.01.21.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.01.21.png)
    
    - Normally, there is a continuous line across the Clavicle and Acromion Process, with Separation Injuries being identified Radiographically by a break in this continuous line between the Clavicle and Acromion Process due to the separation
    
    ![%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.01.52.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.01.52.png)
    

### 3) Glenohumeral Joint

- Between the Glenoid of the Scapula and the Head of the Humerus ('Shoulder Joint Proper' - The most important joint of the Shoulder)
- Synovial Ball and Socket Joint, with multiaxial movement possible in all 3 planes.
    
    ![%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.16.25.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.16.25.png)

# Shoulder Motion and Stability

### Scapula Motion

- Sternoclavicular and Acromioclavicular Joints allow for movement of the Scapula relative to the Clavicle.
- Around the Vertical Axis (Moving in Sagittal Plane) - Glenoid turns anteriorly (Protraction and Retraction)
- Around Horizontal Axis (Moving in Coronal Plane) - Glenoid turns superiorly or inferiorly to allow for wide abduction
- Many different ranges of motion are possible because the Scapula can slide freely over the posterior surface of the posterior rib cage.
    
    ![%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.08.18.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.08.18.png)
    

### Stability of the Glenohumoural Joint

- The Glenohumoral Joint has a trade-off due to its ball and socket structure and the fact that the Head of the Humerus is much larger than the Glenoid of the Scapula. As a result, the Glenohumoural Joint is a highly mobile joint, with movement possibly in all 3 planes, but at the same time, highly unstable.
- Stability is provided to this joint due to surrounding muscles and ligaments:
1. Glenoid Labrum - Fibrocartilage Cup that expands and deepens the Glenoid 
2. Biceps Tendon - Ascends through Bicipital Joint of the Humerus, across the superior surface of the Glenohumoural Joint, to attach to Supraglenoid Tubercle on the Scapula (Provides additional Connection between Humerus and Scapula). This restricts upwards movement of the Glenohumoural Joint
3. Arch of Coracoid and Acromion Processes 
4. Synovial and Fibrous Joint Capsule Membranes - Surround the entire joint. Both are tight superiorly but loose inferiorly to permit wide abduction of the arm
5. Rotator Cuff Muscles
    
    ![%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.16.25.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Shoulder%2086f5cf042d3148328d32ec320105b7bd/Screenshot_2021-07-01_at_16.16.25.png)
    
    ### Movements of the Shoulder Joint
    
    1. Flexion and Extension (Movements in the Sagittal Plane) - Movement of the arm forwards and backwards respectively
    2. Abduction and Adduction (Movement in the Coronal Plane) - Wide Abduction possible as the Scapula can slide freely over the posterior rib cage (Abduction - Scapula rotates laterally and Adduction - Scapula rotates medially)
    3. Circumduction (Flexion, Extension, Abduction + Adduction)
    4. Medial and Lateral Rotation
    5. Protraction and Retraction - Movement/Gliding of the Scapula Anteriorly and Posteriorly along the Posterior rib cage respectively

# Bursae of the Shoulder

- Bursae = Regions where the Synovial Membrane of the Joint protrudes outside the fibrous membrane. These reduce friction between surrounding Ligaments, Muscles and Tendons during joint movement
- Location of Bursae varies amongst individuals but most consistent Bursae of the shoulder are:
1. Subscapular Bursa - Bursa that is found deep to Subscapularis
2. Tendon Sheath - Bursa that surrounds the Tendon of the Long Head of the Biceps
3. Subacromial Bursa - Bursa that is beneath the Acromion process
4. Subdeltoid Bursa - Bursa that is deep to the Deltoid on superolateral region of Humerus
- Bursitis = Inflammation of the Bursae, causing pain and restricting joint movement

# Shoulder Dislocation

- High Mobility and Instability of Glenohumoral Joint means that despite various supporting structures, it is the most frequently dislocated joint, commonly due to sudden blows or extreme rotation of the arm
- The lack of Muscles and Fibrous + Synovial Membranes inferiorly around the Glenohumoral Joint means that dislocation usually occurs with the movement of the Humerus anteriorly and inferiorly (Posterior dislocation is rare). This causes the Acromion Process to protrude laterally and become visible laterally on the anterior body surface as a bony spike, making the shoulder appear flatter vs round.
- Shoulder dislocation can result in tears of the ligaments of the shoulders, Glenoid Labrum, Rotator Cuff Muscles or Nerves such as the Radial or Axillary Nerve

# Rotator Cuff Muscles

- Provide stability to the Glenohumeral Joint by surrounding the Joint but are also involved in moving the shoulder joint
- Rotator Cuff Muscles are incomplete inferiorly, like the Synovial and Fibrous Joint Capsules, to allow for wide abduction of the Arm

# Posterior Nerves

### Subscapular Nerve

- Arises from the Superior Trunk of the Brachial Plexus
- Innervates Supraspinatus and Infraspinatus
- It travels through the Suprascapular Foramen between the Scapula and the Supraspinatus (below the Superior Transverse Scapular Ligament) and then through the Greater Scapular Notch to innervate the Infraspinatus

### Axillary Nerve

- Arises from the Posterior Cord of the Brachial Plexus
- Passes Posterior to the Surgical Neck of the Humerus (and hence, can be damaged if the Humerus is fractured here).
- It innervates Teres Minor, Deltoid and provides Cutaneous Innervation to the 'Regimental Badge' area on the Lateral region of the arm

# Arterial Anastomoses of the Shoulder

- As the Shoulder is highly mobile, different positionings of the Upper Limb could result in the occlusion of arteries around the Shoulder Joint that supply the shoulder and upper limb (due to muscular contractions and bone positioning), resulting in Ischaemia of these regions.
    - At Major joints in the limbs where there is a high range of movement possible, anastomoses are present so that if one vessel is occluded at a specific positioning of the limb, the other vessel involved in the anastomosis will remain unoccluded and can compensate for this occlusion to maintain blood supply to the joint and more distally, preventing ischaemia of that and more distal regions.
