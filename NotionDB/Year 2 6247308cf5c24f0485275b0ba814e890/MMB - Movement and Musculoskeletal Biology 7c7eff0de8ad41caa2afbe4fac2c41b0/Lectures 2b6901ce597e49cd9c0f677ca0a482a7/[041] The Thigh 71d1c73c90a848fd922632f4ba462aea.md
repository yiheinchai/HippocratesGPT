# [041] The Thigh

# Femoral Triangle

- The thigh is the region in the lower limb that goes from the inguinal ligament anteriorly and the lower border of gluteus maximus posteriorly down to the knee
- The femoral triangle is a wedge-shaped depression on the anterior thigh and acts as the area of transition/gateway between the abdomen and the thigh/lower limb
- Its apex points downwards

### **Boundaries**

- The base/superior border of the triangle is the inguinal ligament (which is also the superior boundary of the thigh) and is continuous superiorly with the Abdominal Cavity
- The medial border is the medial aspect of adductor longus
- The lateral border is the medial aspect of sartorius - This crosses in front of the thigh
- The floor consists of iliopsoas, pectineus and adductor longus
- The roof is the fascia lata, which is the thick fascial stocking of the lower limb, specifically the thigh
- The upper part of the triangle opens up into the abdomen
- The apex is long and extended, opening up into the adductor/sartorial canal, which runs deep to the sartorius muscle

- The adductor canal runs under sartorius and through Adductor Magnus and opens into the adductor hiatus which is within the adductor magnus
- There is effectively one continuous opening from the abdomen that opens up into the popliteal fossa, which is the area of transition between the thigh and the leg (behind the knee)

 Contents of the Femoral Triangle (Lateral to Medial - **NAVY = Nerve, Artery, Vein , LYmphatics**):

1. The femoral nerve: 
• This is the major nerve of the anterior compartment of the thigh as well as providing some cutaneous innervation
• This is outside of the femoral sheath
2. Femoral sheath:
• This is a fascial sleeve which contains within it:
2.1) The femoral artery
2.2) The femoral vein
2.3) Lymphatics
3. Fat
- The Femoral Vessels descend through the Femoral Triangle and Adductor Canal to become the Popliteal Vessels. However, terminal branches of the Femoral Nerve exit the Adductor Canal before it opens into the Popliteal Fossa
- The contents of the femoral triangle are fairly superficial and big, so they are often used by clinicians to get wider vascular access, either to the lower limb or to the body
    
    ![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_19.26.57.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_19.26.57.png)
    
- Below the inguinal ligament, midway between the ASIS and the pubic symphysis, the pulse of the femoral artery is palpable

# Femoral Sheath, Canal and Ring

- The femoral sheath is made of CT and contains the femoral artery, femoral vein and lymphatics
- It does not contain the femoral nerve
- Within the femoral sheath, each of these structures is within its own fascial compartment (tubes within a tube)

### The Femoral Canal

- This is the medial of the fascial coverings within the Femoral Canal, which contains lymphatics and fat
- This communicates superiorly with the abdomen via the femoral ring
- The femoral ring is a result of all the ligaments and fascial compartments wrapped around each other to make an opening

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_19.33.26.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_19.33.26.png)

**Boundaries of the Femoral Ring**

- The femoral vein laterally
- The lacunar ligament medially- This is part of the inguinal ligament
- The inguinal ligament anteriorly
- The pectineus posteriorly

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_19.34.49.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_19.34.49.png)

### Hernias

- Just as with the inguinal canal, it is possible to get hernias through the femoral canal and out through the Femoral Ring as this Ring is an area of weakness (Femoral Hernias)
- These are more common in women as the hips are wider and so the femoral ring is larger
- Inguinal hernias are more common in men
- The rigidity of the boundaries of the Femoral Ring means that herniating regions of bowel may become strangulated and begin to undergo necrosis
- It is commonly part of an intestine that makes its way through and slips downwards

# Saphenous Opening

- This is on the anterior aspect of the thigh, just inferior to the inguinal ligament and close to the pubic tubercle (near the Medial End of the Inguinal Ligament)
- This is where the great saphenous vein comes through the fascia lata and joins the femoral vein after ascending superolaterally along the medial aspect of the leg.
- This mirrors how the cephalic vein joins the axillary vein in the upper limb
- The lower limb rotates in the opposite direction to the upper limb, so the great superficial vein is running up on the medial side as opposed to the cephalic vein which runs up on the lateral side
- It goes from the medial side of the foot, medial aspect of the leg and enters through the saphenous opening

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_19.43.11.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_19.43.11.png)

# The Distal Femur

- This is the major bone of the thigh
- The linea aspera is the sharp ridge on the back, which continues from the proximal femur
- It is an area of attachment for many muscles
- At the proximal end of the femur, the linea aspera splits into the pectineal line and the gluteal tuberosity
- At the distal end of the femur, it diverges to form medial and lateral supracondylar lines
- Between the lateral and medial supracondylar lines, there is a flat surface called the popliteal surface
- The end of the femur splits into two articular surfaces, the lateral and medial condyles
- In posterior view, the condyles are separated by a deep intercondylar fossa
- Anteriorly, there is a subtler valley between them which acts as the site of articulation with the patella
- Just above the medial epicondyle on its posterior aspect, where the Medial Supracondylar line ends, there is an extra growth of bone called the adductor tubercle. Part of adductor magnus inserts here
- Inferior to the Adductor Tubercle medially and at the end of the Lateral Supracondylar Line, the Medial and Lateral Epicondyles are found - They support the major collateral ligaments of the knee, rather than acting as a surface for muscle origin
- The medial condyle projects outwards more than the lateral condyle

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_19.51.57.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_19.51.57.png)

# Proximal Tibia and Fibula

- Although these bones are not in the thigh, many muscles that are in the thigh, act across the knee and so insert into the proximal ends of the tibia and fibula

### Proximal Tibia

- It is very large and more medial than the Fibula
- It is unlike the upper limb, in that the tibia remains larger at the distal end as it is the main weight-bearing bone of the leg
- It has an expanded proximal end, with large but unusually flat medial and lateral condyles - This is contrasted with the rounded condyles of the femur (The Condyles of the Tibia articulate with those of the Femur)
- There is a raised intercondylar area between the two condyles
- On the Anterior Surface of the Tibia, Inferior to the Condyles (Found Medially) there is a bony extension called the tibial tuberosity, which is where the patellar ligament attaches

### Proximal Fibula

- It is a smaller, more lateral and much more delicate bone than then Tibia
- It does not participate in the knee joint
- The head of the fibula, with a rounded facet medially, articulates with the lateral condyle of the tibia
- It has a blunt apex above the head
- It has a neck just before reaching the shaft of the fibula

# Ventral and Dorsal Limb Halves and Evolution of the Lower Limb

- During development, there is a limb bud that grows outward from the body
- The bones are in the middle of those limb buds separating the muscles into ventral and dorsal groups, each with their own associated nerves
- As these muscles develop, they drag their nerve supply out with them
    
    ![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_20.04.58.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_20.04.58.png)
    
- In a salamander, the dorsal and ventral muscles groups are clearly demarcated as the limbs do not rotate and remain transversely orientated
- With tetrapods, the limbs twist:
• The hindlimb twists medially and the forelimb twists laterally so that the elbow points posteriorly and the knee anteriorly
• There is also a secondary pronation of the forearm
- This means the compartments that were developmentally ventral, end up posterior and medial (to some degree)
- The compartments that were developmentally dorsal end up anterior and lateral
- This relates to the innervation

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_20.05.53.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_20.05.53.png)

# Compartments of the Thigh

- Extensions of the fascia lata (thigh) and crural fascia (leg), that go in and meet with the bones, in so doing, they form different compartments of the lower limb
- In the thigh:
• The anterior compartment is developmentally dorsal
• The posterior and medial compartments are developmentally ventral
- In the leg:
• The anterior and lateral compartments are developmentally dorsal
• The posterior compartment is developmentally ventral
- These compartments divide up regions of the lower limb into groups of muscles

# Muscles of the Anterior Thigh

- There are 7 muscles of the anterior thigh
- They are flexors of the hip and extensors of the knee
- The femoral nerve innervates all the muscles of the anterior compartment except for psoas major

- This is a combined muscle which involves four separate muscles
- Quadriceps femoris = four heads of the femur
- Three of these muscles are the vasti muscles, and these only cross and help to stabilise the knee joint and do not cross the hip joint
- They all insert into the quadriceps femoris tendon, which inserts into the patella, which in turn inserts into the patellar tendon, which inserts into the tibial tuberosity which is on the front of the tibia
- They are all innervated by the femoral nerve (L2, L3 and L4)

---

# Muscles of the Medial Thigh

- There are 6 muscles of the medial thigh
- These muscles primarily act to adduct the leg (pull it inwards), and can act to medially rotate the leg (except Obturator Extenus)
- They are mostly innervated by the obturator nerve (L2 and L3)
- Gracilis, adductor longus and pectineus are the most anterior/superficial layer of adductor muscles

# Adductor Hiatus

- The adductor hiatus is a gap between the two insertions of the two parts of the adductor magnus
- The adductor hiatus is where the adductor canal ends, to allow its contents to enter into the popliteal fossa
- It is only the femoral artery and vein that pass through the adductor hiatus, the femoral nerve has already split into many branches before this point
    
    ![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.15.06.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.15.06.png)

# Muscles of the Posterior Thigh ("Hamstrings")

- These are collectively referred to as hamstrings and are extensors of the thigh at the hip and flexors of the leg at the knee
- There are three muscles
- They mostly originate from the ischial tuberosity
- They are mostly innervated by the tibial part of the sciatic nerve

# Nerves in the Anterior Compartment of the Thigh

### Femoral Nerve

- It enters the thigh by going underneath the inguinal ligament
- The muscles of the anterior compartment are innervated by the femoral nerve (except for psoas major)
- Psoas major originates so high up that it receives its innervation directly from the anterior rami of L1 to L3
- The quadriceps femoris muscles receive their innervation primarily from spinal cord segments L3 and L4
- These nerve roots are responsible for the knee-jerk reflex
- If you tap the patellar ligament with a hammer, there will be a jerk of the knee. It therefore tests the integrity of spinal cord levels L3 and L4

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.47.38.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.47.38.png)

# Nerves in the Medial Compartment of the Thigh

- Most of the muscles of the medial compartment receive their innervation from the obturator nerve (L2 – L4)
- The exceptions to this are:
1) Pectineus which is innervated by the femoral nerve (L2 and L3)
2) The hamstring part of the adductor magnus which is innervated by the tibial part of the sciatic nerve (L2 – L4)

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.49.10.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.49.10.png)

# Nerves in the Posterior Compartment of the Thigh

- Muscles of the posterior compartment are innervated by the tibial division of the sciatic nerve
- The exception to this is the short head of biceps femoris which is innervated by the common fibular division of the sciatic nerve
- The sciatic nerve then goes on to innervate the posterior compartment of the leg and foot
- Sciatic Nerve is found deep to Adductor magnus and is crossed superficially by the Long Head of the Biceps Femoris.
- Just superior to the Popliteal Fossa, the Sciatic Nerve divides into the Fibular and Tibial Nerves. The Tibial Nerve enters the Popliteal Fossa (Alongside Popliteal Vessels) and descends to innervate the Posterior Compartment of the Leg. The Common Fibular Division tends to project more inferolaterally and hence, innervates the Lateral and Anterior Compartments of the Leg

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.50.13.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.50.13.png)

### Lumbosacral Plexus

**Dorsal divisions:**

- The femoral nerve (L2 – L4) supplies the anterior compartment and so is developmentally dorsal. This is why it consists of the dorsal divisions of L2 – L4

**Ventral divisions:**

- The obturator nerve supplies the medial compartment and so comes from the ventral divisions of L2 – L4
- The tibial division of the sciatic nerve originates from L4 – S3 and supplies the posterior compartment, which is developmentally ventral and so it will be the ventral divisions of L4 – S3

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.52.46.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.52.46.png)

# Cutaneous Nerves of the Lower Limb

- The femoral nerve gives off the Anterior Cutaneous Nerves of Thigh, which give sensory innervation to the front of the thigh, as well as giving off the saphenous nerve which innervates the medial aspect of the leg and foot
- The obturator nerve innervates a patch of skin on the medial aspect of the upper thigh
- The tibial division of the sciatic nerve, innervates the Posterolateral of the Lower Leg (Ankle, Foot and Little Toe) as well as the sole and lateral part of the foot
- The common fibular nerve provides innervation to the lateral part of the Leg/calf and the dorsum of the foot

# Arteries of the Thigh

### Femoral Artery

- The femoral artery is the continuation of the external iliac artery
- It comes under the inguinal ligament, through the femoral triangle, through the adductor canal and through the adductor hiatus
- When it enters the Popliteal Fossa posterior to the knee, it changes its name to the popliteal artery
- It gives off several small branches in the femoral triangle, which supply the upper thigh, lower abdomen and perineum
- It then gives off the deep artery of the thigh/profunda femoris (Largest and Most Important Branch - The Major Blood Supply to the Thigh), which give off lateral and medial circumflex arteries which contribute to cruciate anastomoses around the hip
- They also supply the different compartments of the thigh:
1. The lateral circumflex supplies the anterior compartment
2. The medial circumflex supplies the medial compartment
- Whilst in the adductor canal, the femoral artery gives off perforating arteries, of which there are 3 to 4
- They penetrate through adductor magnus and supply the posterior compartment of the thigh
- The femoral artery is the major but not the only blood supply of the thigh

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.57.31.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_22.57.31.png)

### Obturator Artery

- The obturator artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery
- It passes through the obturator canal and divides into anterior and posterior branches
• These join the cruciate anastomoses
• The posterior branch gives off a branch which supplies the head of the femur
- It supplies the medial compartment along with the medial circumflex artery that comes of the profunda femoris

![%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_23.01.22.png](%5B041%5D%20The%20Thigh%2071d1c73c90a848fd922632f4ba462aea/Screenshot_2021-07-08_at_23.01.22.png)

### Inferior Gluteal Artery

- The inferior gluteal artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery
- It comes out of the greater sciatic foramen underneath piriformis
- It supplies adjacent muscles of the gluteal region, the posterior compartment of the thigh and it contributes to the cruciate anastomosis

# Veins and Lymphatics of the Leg

### Great Saphenous Vein and Superficial Nodes

- There are deep veins in the lower limb which tend to follow major arteries
- The great saphenous vein is the main superficial vein that originates off the union of the dorsal venous arch of the foot and dorsal vein of the big toe
- It travels along the medial aspect of the leg, and then goes through the saphenous opening just under the inguinal ligament to join the femoral vein
- Superficial lymph follows the great saphenous vein to reach the superficial inguinal nodes in the superficial Fascia parallel to the Inguinal Ligament. This receives Lymph from the Gluteal Region, Lower Abdominal Wall, Perineum and Superficial Lower Leg. This lymph then drains into external iliac nodes:
• There are horizontal and vertical groups
• These are clustered around the junction between the great saphenous vein and the femoral vein

### Small Saphenous Vein

- The small saphenous vein is another superficial vein which originates off the lateral side of the dorsal venous arch
- Within the superficial fascia of the posterior leg, it penetrates the deep fascia to join the popliteal vein around the knee to become the Femoral Vein

- Perforating veins connect the superficial and deep veins
- There are valves so that there is only flow from superficial to deep
- This is another compensatory method to make up for blood having to work against gravity when it returns from the leg
- When the valves start to fail, conditions such as varicose veins begin to develop
- Deep lymph follows deep veins to deep inguinal nodes (Medial to Femoral Vein), receiving lymph from the Perineum and Deep Lower Leg. Lymph from these regions then drain into external iliac nodes
- All lymph eventually drains to the external iliac nodes
