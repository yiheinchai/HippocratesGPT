# [004] Cartilage and Endochondral Ossification

# Cartilage

- It is a structural and load-bearing connective tissue.
- It maintains form and resists deformation, but is flexible
- The mechanical properties of healthy cartilage due to:
1) Composite matrix (collagen II and proteoglycans)
2) Fluid flow that dissipates loading forces under mechanical loading
- In the trachea, Hyaline Cartilage is found as C-shaped discontinuous rings/arcs which keeps the Trachea Patent

- In the trachea, the hyaline cartilage rings are surrounded by a fibrous perichondrium, containing Type I Collagen (which often contains artefacts due to the presence of blood vessels)
- Hyaline Cartilage stains blue with Alcian Blue, which specifically dyes the Acidic Mucopolysaccharides/Glycosaminoglycans which are produced by Chondrocytes, whilst collagen stains pink
- Chondrocytes are small, spherical structures found in cartilage, which stain a darker turquoise than the surrounding cartilage
- Different clusters of Chondrocytes often stain to variable/different intensities due to varying [Glycosaminoglycans]
- They are often found in clusters/groups and may have a central artefact
- Chondrocytes are surrounded by lots of a much lighter amorphous/homogenous matrix

- Cartilage can grow in 2 ways:
1) Interstitial growth: Chondrocytes go through cycles of cell division to form clusters of daughter Chondrocytes surrounded by ECM
2) Appositional growth : Addition of New Cells to the cartilage, at the border between the Cartilage and Perichondrium.  These new cells arise from Chondroblasts in the Perichondrium which migrate into the Cartilage, differentiate to form Chondrocytes and produce ECM
- Almost all Appositional Growth occurs early in life but Hyaline Cartilage continues to slowly grow throughout adult life
- The simplest tissue containing no nerves, no blood vessels, only cells and ECM.
- Chondrocytes are not connected with one another, consisting of 'islands'/Clumps of Chondrocytes (formed via Interstitial Growth) surrounded by ECM.
- This is in contrast to Osteocytes in bone which are connected to one another via Cytoplasmic processes to allow communication between cells
- It is an evolutionarily primitive tissue
- This means that Chondrocytes receive nutrients and O₂ from the nearest capillaries, which are found within the Perichondrium.
- Nutrients and O₂ from the nearest capillaries reach the Chondrocytes via diffusion or more commonly, diffusion aided by fluid flow to and from the Perichondrium when the tissue is under mechanical loading.
- The Avascularity of Cartilage means that Chondrocytes have a low metabolic/turnover rate, meaning it takes a long time for Cartilage to repair itself

**Composition**

- It is comprised of Chondrocytes and an ECM produced by and surrounding the Chondrocytes.
- The ECM has a fibrous component (Collagen Type II - Forms very fine fibrils that are only visible under EM Microscopy)
- The Fibrous Component of the Cartilage ECM can be modified via the addition of Elastin (E.g Ear Pinna) or Type I Collagen (Fibrocartilage)
- The other component of the ECM is ground substance, formed from GAGs and Proteoglycans (GAGs + Core protein)
- Proteoglycans can aggregate together to form aggregates which strongly attract H₂O, creating a high swelling pressure within the Cartillage.
- The Ground Substance has a higher turnover rate than the fibrous component of the ECM
- Properties of cartilage (young and healthy):
1) Permeable: stiff in compression due to proteoglycan aggregates
2) Fibrous network: can resist high tensile stresses – collagen
3) Fluid: flows under load or deformation to help dissipate forces
4) High swelling pressure: matrix is swollen with water due to proteoglycan aggregates

### Types of Cartilage

1. Permanent cartilage (present in adult life): Hyaline Cartilage in trachea and bronchioles, Elastic Cartilage in ear, articular cartilage in joints
2. Temporary cartilage (present during growth and development): epiphyseal growth plate, Meckel’s cartilage (forms Jaw), base of skull

### Permanent Cartilage

- Small, discontinuous rings of Hyaline Cartilage are found surrounding the bronchioles to keep them patent (Appear Oval-Shaped in TS)

- The Ear Pinna contains Elastic Cartilage (Hyaline Cartilage + Elastin)
- Elastic Fibres of Elastic Cartilage arise from the Perichondrium and run deep into the Cartilage

![Screenshot 2021-08-30 at 17.34.08.png](%5B004%5D%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%205c879af6452a4804ae2a9dbb80f629e8/Screenshot_2021-08-30_at_17.34.08.png)

Types of Cartilage Joints:

1. Synovial: freely moveable (contains articular cartilage)
2. Symphysis: (bone – cartilage – fibrous tissue – cartilage – bone). These allow slight movement (secondary cartilaginous joint)
3. Synchondrosis: (bone – cartilage – bone) negligible movement (primary cartilaginous joint). These are mainly found when young, during development (E.g Spheno-Occipital Synchrondrosis at the base of the skull)
- Articular Cartilage stains a lighter pink than fibrous tissue and appears more amorphous (appears 'speckled' due to presence of Chondrocytes) and curved/arced in shape

![Screenshot 2021-08-30 at 17.38.14.png](%5B004%5D%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%205c879af6452a4804ae2a9dbb80f629e8/Screenshot_2021-08-30_at_17.38.14.png)

- Mineralised Cartilage is found between Unmineralised Cartilage and Bone at joints and has an irregularly shaped border with Bone but a smooth border with the Unmineralised cartilage (which itself normally has a smooth/regular articular surface)
- Mineralised Cartilage is Articular Cartilage containing Calcium Phosphate Hydroxyapatite (and is hence, harder than Unmineralised Cartilage). It stains slightly darker than Unmineralised Cartilage
- Bone Marrow contains lots of Blood Vessels and Bone contains Vascular Channels whilst Cartilage contains no blood vessels (hence appears completely amorphous with no artefacts in contrast to bone)
- Articular Cartilage has the same appearance as Hyaline Cartilage except it lacks a Fibrous Perichondrium on its articular surface (to minimise friction between the articulating surfaces during movement)

![Screenshot 2021-08-30 at 17.40.42.png](%5B004%5D%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%205c879af6452a4804ae2a9dbb80f629e8/Screenshot_2021-08-30_at_17.40.42.png)

- The Tidemark zone between Mineralised (Hard) and Unmineralised (Soft) Articular Cartilage advances towards the Articular Surface as an individual ages due to increased calcification of Cartilage
- This likely occurs to strongly adhere the Unmineralised Cartilage to the Subchondral Bone
- This can also occur in Tendons and large blood vessels

# Collagen

- It is a stable, structural ECM protein
- A collagen molecule is a triple-stranded helix (3 α chains)
- It is the most abundant body protein, making up 25% of total body protein (almost all of this Collagen is type 1)
- Main collagen types:
1. Type I: 90% of total, forms bone, skin, tendon, ligaments, cornea and internal organs. 
- This is formed as fibrils which aggregate to form fibres which are visible under a light microscope
1. Type II: main type of collagen found in cartilage, intervertebral discs and vitreous humour. 
- It is found as fibrils which form a fine meshwork that is not visible under light microscope.
1. Type III: Exists as fibrils which aggregate to form Reticular fibres, which form a  coarse mesh to hold cells together (larger fibrils than Type II Collagen). 
- It is found in skin, blood vessels, internal organs (liver).
1. Type IV: forms a sheet-like network that forms the structural basis of the Basal Lamina

# Glycosaminoglycans

- Polymer comprised of repeating disaccharide units, forming very large polysaccharides
- Up to 25,000 residues in a chain
- In GAGs, specific sugar residues are modified via the addition of Acidic carboxyl groups (-COO⁻)
- This strong -ve charge (due to acidic groups such as COO⁻) makes the Molecule hydrophilic and attracts water (only in cartilage) to makes a thick jelly/gel-like substance (high water binding capacity)
- Hyaluronan can have an extremely large Molecular Weight and can occupy a large volume of the ECM due to the sheer quantity of H₂O that it can bind
- Hyaluronan is a joint lubricant in synovial fluid (hyaluronic acid) but is also found in the Cartilage ECM

![Screenshot 2021-08-29 at 22.43.47.png](%5B004%5D%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%205c879af6452a4804ae2a9dbb80f629e8/Screenshot_2021-08-29_at_22.43.47.png)

# Proteoglycans

- These are formed when Glycosaminoglycans are attached to a core protein (looks like a bottle brush)
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-08-29 at 22.53.07.png](%5B004%5D%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%205c879af6452a4804ae2a9dbb80f629e8/Screenshot_2021-08-29_at_22.53.07.png)
    
- Proteoglycans can be stuck onto a core of hyaluronic acid/Hyaluronan via Linked Proteins to form extremely large Proteoglycan Aggregates (only found in cartilage and visible under EM Microscopy)
- These Aggregtes are the primary molecules responsible for the high Water binding capacity of the Cartilage Matrix (sucking in water to make jelly substance)

# Ossification

- Process of forming new bone by laying down osteoblasts. This occurs in 2 ways
- Endochondral ossification: occurs in long bones that are formed initially as a cartilage model, which is then replaced by bone. How most bones are formed (cartilage framework → bone)
- Intramembranous ossification: occurs in flat bones where osteoblasts differentiate from progenitor and form bone directly with no cartilaginous precursors/framework (just forms bone)

---

# Endochondral Ossification

- Initially a cartilage framework for the long bones is established, which is replaced with bone to form long bones
- Primary ossification centre is found in the middle of the framework, with bone beginning to form at the Edges of the Shaft lateral to this Ossification centre to form a 'bony collar'
- Chondrocytes undergo hypertrophy and becomes mineralised, sending signals, which trigger angiogenesis within the bone
- Blood vessels penetrate the growing bone surrounding the bony shaft and clear out a vascularised marrow cavity by destroying cartilage
- Epiphyseal growth plate exists between the primary and secondary ossification centres and begins to grow as the bone continues to grow and the vasculature within the Marrow Cavity becomes more complex
- Secondary ossification centre form at either end of the long bones within the Epiphyseas.
- Here, vessels penetrate the ends of the Bone near the Secondary Ossification Centres and destroy cartilage here to form a Vascularised marrow cavity, separated from the Primary Cavity by the Epiphyseal Growth Plates
- Secondary ossification centres ossify and becomes bones post- puberty due to the activity of Gonadal Steroids.
- These steroids cause the Epiphyseal growth plates to disappear to connect the Primary and Secondary Marrow Cavities to form a single Vascularised Marrow Cavity, surrounded by bone
- Cartilage remains at the tips of the long bone which form the articular cartilage surfaces
- Process occurs in convoluted manner with cartilage framework due to evolution from primitive/ancestral Cartilage skeletons of aquatic animals (where there is little force on the skeleton), with this skeleton needing to be ossified in order to support living on dry land, where there is significant force exerted on the skeleton

![Screenshot 2021-08-29 at 19.24.19.png](%5B004%5D%20Cartilage%20and%20Endochondral%20Ossification%205c879af6452a4804ae2a9dbb80f629e8/Screenshot_2021-08-29_at_19.24.19.png)

**Growth Plates**

- In growth plates, there is no fibrous perichondrium and Chondrocytes are organised in columns running between the Ossification centres
- In the part of the Epiphyseal Growth Plate near the Secondary Ossification Centre, Chondroblasts are found.
- Upon activation, these Chondroblasts divide, differentiate and migrate towards the bone marrow to form the Columns of cells seen, whilst synthesising the ECM (stains very light)
- As these cells move towards the bone marrow, they undergo Hypertrophy (enlarge) and become square-shaped whilst the surrounding ECM becomes more intensely stained as this ECM begins to Calcify.
- At the boundary between the Growth Plate and the Bone Marrow, Marrow Cells attack the edge of the Growth Plate, destroying the Hypertrophied Chondrocytes, leaving strands/fibres of  Calcified ECM, causing the Growth Plate to shrink in size and appear as though it is moving towards the Ossification Centre.
- These longitudinal strands of Calcified Cartilage are found running within the Bone Marrow to strengthen the forming bone
- Deep within the Bone Marrow, bone is deposited on the spicules of Calcified Cartilage by Osteoblasts
- This process also occurs in the development of the Vertebral Bodies

# Intramembraneous Ossification

- Method of forming flat bones from precursor cells, without a cartilage model
- Progenitor cells within cartilage/mesenchyme differentiate to form osteoblasts, which surround the Bone Matrix and release/secrete osteoid (uncalcified bone matrix).
- Osteoblasts then differentiate to become osteocytes and the matrix is then mineralised to form bone.

# Mineralisation of Cartilage

This occurs in 3 locations

1. Mineralisation at the junction of articular cartilage and bone (Tidemark zone)
- Tidemark zone advances with age so that cartilage becomes hard and mineralised whilst the unmineralised layer decreases in size.
1. Mineralisation where cartilage is replaced with bone during growth- endochondral ossification
2. Mineralisation within hyaline cartilage as part of the ageing process. Body is naturally saturated with calcium and phosphate. Additional levels will precipitate in the body.

# Cartilage and Disease

### Vitamin D Deficiency

- Cartilage Calcification is dependent on 1,25(OH₂)D₃  as Vit D ensures that sufficient Calcium is absorbed into the blood stream via the Gut
- Results in defective mineralisation
- Rickets (children), where both cartilage and bone are affected. The growth plate widens, fails to mineralise and is thus not replaced by bone. This causes bones to become soft and weak, causing them to bone
- Osteomalacia (adults) - As Endochondral Ossification is no longer occurring, this does not impact the growth of bones. However, Bone turnover via Intramembraneous Ossification is still occurring.
- Here, newly formed bone matrix (via Intramembraneous Ossification) during the turnover process fails to mineralise, causing bones to soften/waken, leading to deformities and fractures

### Osteoarthritis

- Localised condition resulting in the fatigue failure and abrasion of collagen meshwork and loss of proteoglycan aggregates. This causes cartilage erosion and the formation of bony outgrowths (osteophytes) in an attempt to add stability to the joints despite cartilage damage. This leads to bone deformities
- Commonly seen in musicians (due to repetitive movements), notably guitarists who present with Heberden's Nodes (Hard irregular bony lumps surrounding the Distal Interphalangeal Joints)
- It is often accompanied by inflammation but is not directly caused by Inflammation (it is not an inflammatory disease)
- This most commonly occurs due to trauma and wear and tear
- 50%> of over 35s have osteoarthritic changes in at least one joint, which are usually minor.
- Currently, there are no specific drugs to prevent or Rx Osteoarthritis but can be treated via Joint replacements
- Osteoarthiris could be caused by the Tidemark Zone.
- As we age, there is an advancing, irregular mineral tidemark that migrates towards the Articular Surface.
- This irregular tidemark zone could act in an abrasive manner and damage soft cartilage as the joint articulates by pressing the soft cartilage against the sharp, mineral protrusions (calcified cartilage) of the irregular tidemark zone which shreds/tears the cartilage

### Rheumatoid Arthritis

- Complex, systemic autoimmune inflammatory condition. It is mainly a chronic condition with flare-ups
- It primarily affects the Synovium in joints, with release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1 commonly seen.
- Symptoms include morning stiffness, joint pain, deformity, low-grade fever, weight loss, bone loss (directly due to inflammation), skin nodules, ↑ risk of CVD. It is linked to inflammatory vasculitis
- Around 1% of the UK population is affected and it is 3 times more common in females and smokers (perhaps due to abrupt decline in Circulating [Oestrogen] following menopause). There is also a mild genetic linkage.
- 1% of UK population affected by 3 times more females than males
- Antibodies against TNF-α, B-lymphocytes producing autoantibodies, glucocorticoids or NSAIDS are effective in some patients to reduce inflammation and autoimmune damage.
