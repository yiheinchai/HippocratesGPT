# Types of Exercise

[Types of Exercise](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Types%20of%20Exercise%20f24f9e4a60244a1cb9a082de374ee50e.md)

- Type IIa Muscle Fibres are an intermediate type of Fibre between Type I and II
- For Low Intensity Exercise (Weak muscle contractions are needed), Type I Muscle Fibres are mainly used/recruited and as intensity increases (and stronger muscle contractions are needed), Type IIa and then Type IIx Fibres are recruited

# Sources of Fuel

1. Muscle and liver glycogen - Both may be mobilized to release glucose during fasting or exercise (notably high intensity).
- During fasting, the main source of glycogen that is mobilised is Liver Glycogen whilst during exercise, the main source of glycogen that is mobilised is Muscle Glycogen
- Muscle Glycogen is a significant fuel for muscles in that exhaustion during exercise coincides with the depletion of muscle glycogen so that the muscle is unable to contract further until the Muscle Glycogen is replenished
1. Plasma glucose - Uptake of Plasma Glucose by muscle increases during the fed state, exercise and after exercise. 
- This occurs during the fed state due to the activity/release of Insulin to keep [Glucose] constant, during exercise due to increased demand for respiratory substrates to produce ATP required for exercise and after exercise as muscle sensitivity to Insulin increases after exercise in order to replenish the Muscle Glycogen store that is used in exercise (mainly anaerobic)
1. Muscle and adipose TAG - Usage increases during fasting and exercise (notably low intensity)
- During fasting, the main source of TAG is from Adipose tissue and during low intensity/Aerobic exercise, the main source of TAG is from Muscle
1. Plasma lipoproteins - Muscles secrete lipoprotein lipase/LPL after exercise which breaks down circulating TAGs into FAs. 
- These FAs diffuse out of the blood stream into the Muscle, where it can be used to replenish the Muscle TAG stores.
- It is useful during fasting as Low Insulin levels in fasting means Muscles used more TAG and Less Glucose to produce ATP, in order to keep [Glucose] constant
- This fuel source is useless during exercise as it occurs too slowly.
1. Ketone bodies - Not usually used during exercise, however in very
prolonged exercise or very prolonged fasting (more commonly), they may be used by muscles to maintain [Glucose]. 
- However, this is dependent on the liver's supply and only occurs once all the Liver's glycogen has been used up

---

# Production of ATP

- During exercise, ATP is rapidly hydrolysed
- Intensity and duration of muscle exertion limited to how quickly
ATP can be regenerated and for how long
- There are 5 main ways through which ATP can be produced
1. Adenylate kinase - Can regenerate ATP from ADP almost immediately. Pi is transferred from one ADP to another to form ATP and AMP 
- It catalyses the reaction 2ADP ‚áå ATP + AMP
- However, it causes [AMP] to increase (which is usually extremely low) and AMP is a sensitive indicator of cell energy status
1. Creatine Kinase - Phosphocreatine can maintain [ATP] for first 5s of maximal exertion (until the PCr stores have been exhausted), giving time for the muscle to upregulate other pathways that produce ATP in an attempt to maintain [ATP]. 
- This is done by the transfer of Pi from Phosphocreatine to ADP to form ATP
1. Glycolysis - As this is an anaerobic process (Coenzymes can be reformed without requiring oxygen), it is not limited by $O_2$ availability of the muscle and once stimulated, it can provides ATP rapidly (Due to this lack of aerobic limitation)
2. FA oxidation - Supplies lots of ATP per FA being oxidised.
- However, ATP is produced at a much slower rate via FA Oxidation (Rate increase upon stimulation) than Glycolysis as unlike Glycolysis, ATP Production via FA Oxidation requires $O_2$ to reform the Oxidised Coenzymes from the Reduced Coenzymes formed in FA Oxidation
1. TCA and ETC - These are responsible for majority of ATP production from fuels and are aerobic processes that rely on $O_2$ to reform Oxidised Coenzymes during the ETC

---

# Muscle Metabolism in the Fed State (at Rest)

- In the fed state at rest, the body's main metabolic concern is decreasing [Glucose] so that it is at normal physiological levels where it will not glycate/damage proteins in vessel walls etc.
- Muscle - Insulin stimulates an increase in glucose uptake.
- The rate of Glycogenesis and Glycolysis increase while fatty acid oxidation is inhibited in order to decrease [Glucose] back to the normal level.
- Liver - It can sense high [Glucose] within the blood entering it from the Portal Vein from the GI Tract and increase its uptake accordingly to maintain [Glucose].
- The increased glucose that is taken up is used for synthesis of glycogen initially but once these stores are filled, glucose will be converted into TAG
- Pancreas - ùõΩ-cells can sense high [Glucose], resulting in increased glucose uptake to maintain [Glucose]
- Increased [Glucose] also stimulates Insulin release from ùõΩ-cells, increasing Glucose uptake by Skeletal Muscle mainly, but also Adipose Tissue and the Liver
- Adipose Tissue - Insulin stimulates increased glucose uptake and favours lipogenesis and inhibits lipolysis, in order to decrease [Glucose] back to a constant level

---

# Muscle Metabolism in the Fasting State (At Rest)

- In the fed state at rest, the body's main metabolic concern is increasing [Glucose] so that it is at normal physiological levels.
- Muscle - Decrease in Insulin release causes reduced glucose uptake and increased FA Oxidation to maintain ATP Production but minimise glucose metabolism
- Fatty acid oxidation increases and Amino acids may be released for Gluconeogenesis in prolonged fasting where Glycogen stores become depleted to maintain [Glucose]
- Glycerol from TAGs, Lactate from Glycolysis and AAs can all be used as Gluconeogenic substrates
- Liver -  It can directly sense ‚Üì [Glucose] in the Portal Vein.
- Glucose is released from glycogen stores and gluconeogenesis occurs in order to maintain [Glucose]
- Pancreas - ùõΩ-cells can sense low [Glucose], causing Glucose Uptake and Insulin release ‚Üì
- Adipose tissue - Reduced Insulin release stimulates release of fatty acids and inhibits FA Synthesis, providing FAs into the blood stream as an alternate fuel source for other structures to minimise glucose metabolism

---

# Muscle Metabolism During Exercise

- As energy/ATP requirements increase during exercise, there must be increased fuel metabolism to meet these demands
- Muscle - Glycogenolysis of Muscle Glycogen and glucose uptake increase in order to meet increased ATP Demands.
- Uptake of fatty acids and breakdown of TAG may also increase (In Aerobic Exercise) to further provide FAs for metabolism by tissues to maintain ATP production
- Liver - Adrenaline stimulates glycogenolysis, causing more glucose to be released, which can then be taken up and metabolised by other tissues to maintain constant [Glucose].
- Lactate produced by Glycolysis during Anaerobic Exercise and released by the exercising muscle is taken up by the Liver converted back to Glucose via Gluconeogenesis
- Adipose tissue - Adrenaline favours release of fatty acids, providing FAs as substrates for metabolism to meet increased ATP Demands during Aerobic Exercise

---

# High Intensity Exercise

- High intensity contractions require a high rate of ATP replenishment to replace the ATP that is rapidly used up
- Glycolysis is pathway most suited for this, due to lack of reliance on oxygen diffusion into tissue meaning upon stimulation, high rates of Glycolysis and ATP production can be established
- Type II muscle fibres are recruited and best suited for these high intensity contractions as they have high glycolytic capacity
- In 5 seconds before rate of glycolysis can be increased/upregulated, stores of phosphocreatine are used to replenish ATP, via creatine kinase
- Adenylate kinase replenishes ATP from excess ADP.
- The AMP produced in this reaction is an allosteric effector for several enzymes

---

# Adenylate Kinase

- Catalyses formation of ATP from ADP and helps to maintain ATP:ADP ratio
- 2ADP ‚Üí ATP + AMP (Catalysed by Adenylate Cyclase)
- This reaction increases the cellular [AMP]

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 23.23.56.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_23.23.56.png)

- As [AMP] is usually much lower than [ATP] or [ADP] (very low), a small increase in [AMP] during exercise produces a large %/relative change in [AMP].
- In exercise, there is relatively no/a very small change in [ATP] or [ADP] due to their relatively large [ ] at rest
- These large relative changes in [AMP] can dramatically influence the activity of enzymes that bind AMP, with a binding affinity between [AMP] at rest and during exercise
- [AMP] is therefore a sensitive indicator of cell energy status, with larger [AMP] indicating high rates of cellular ATP usage (Allowing for detection of high rates of Metabolism before [ATP] changes)
- AMP is an important allosteric effector

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 23.24.49.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_23.24.49.png)

---

# Phosphocreatine

- An energy store, that is important in replenishing ATP in first 5s of maximal exertion
- Skeletal muscle contains high levels of PCr and as it is a very small compound, it can diffuse through cells easily, compared to ATP.
- $PCr + ADP + H^+ ‚Üí Cr + ATP$ (Catalysed by Creatine Kinase)
- The [PCr] in skeletal muscle is 30 mM, compared to 7 mM in other cell types as Skeletal Muscle can have rapid changes in its rate of ATP Usage, whilst other cells use ATP at a fairly constant rate.
- Whilst other cells use PCr as a way to transfer Pi between different parts of the cell (ATP used to make PCr in Mitochondria, which travels out of the mitochondria to another region of the cell where it is used to reform ATP), Skeletal Muscle Cells use PCr to maintain [ATP] during high intensity exercise where there is a higher rate of ATP usage than production
- As pH ‚Üì (anaerobic glycolysis producing lactic acid, which ‚Üë[$H^+$]), and [ADP]‚Üë during high intensity exercise, the position of equilibrium shifts to the right, to increase the rate of the forwards reaction/ATP Formation from PCr
- After exercise is over, Adenylate Kinase works to convert AMP to ADP, so that it can be converted to ATP to be used in the ETC and replenish Phosphocreatine

![Screenshot 2021-09-27 at 17.17.39.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-27_at_17.17.39.png)

# Glucose Availability

- To support exercise (notably high intensity), glucose needs to be made available so that muscle can take this up to produce ATP to meet increased ATP needs
- Breakdown of muscle glycogen is stimulated by activation of Glycogen Phosphorylase
- Breakdown of liver glycogen is stimulated and regulated by a similar process, whereby Liver Glycogen Phosphorylase is activated during exercise to increase Glycogenolysis
- Muscle contraction during Exercise causes translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters to membrane (independent from Insulin activity in the Fed State), increasing membrane [GLUT4] and allowing the cell to take up glucose from blood.
- This translocation of GLUT4 is localised to the specific muscle fibre that is contracting and does not impact the translocation of GLUT4 receptors found in other tissues
- The amount of glucose made available is affected by other factors, fed or fasting state, duration of exercise etc.
- In the Fed State, there is increased GLUT4 translocation to the Cell Membrane due to Insulin Signalling and Muscle Contraction during exercise.
- In the Fasting State, lack of Insulin signalling reduces GLUT4 membrane translocation but there would be increased Glycogenolysis.
- In Low Intensity Exercise, Glucose availability is higher at the beginning (notably due to Glycogenolysis) but as the exercise progresses and glycogen stores deplete, metabolism shifts from using Glucose to FA as a metabolic fuel to maintain [Glucose]
- There is a limit to rate at which glucose can be made available
- Glycogenolysis in Muscle is favoured by ‚Üë[AMP], Adrenaline and $Ca^{2+}$ (due to muscle contraction)

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 23.28.16.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_23.28.16.png)

# Phosphorylase Kinase

- Phosphorylase Kinase activates Glycogen Phosphorylase by Phosphorylating it.
- Phosphorylase Kinase is a tetramer of tetramers, with Œ±,Œ≤,Œ≥ and Œ¥ subunits.
- It is partially activated by $Ca^{2+}$(which increases in [ ] during exercise/muscle contraction) or phosphorylation by PKA individually, or maximally activated by both
- $Ca^{2+}$binds to the Œ¥ Subunit (Calmodulin), PKA Phosphorylates the Œ≤ subunit and it is the Œ≥ subunit that has catalytic activity
- In muscle, Adrenaline stimulates PKA, while contractions are
associated with release of $Ca^{2+}$ into cytosol
- In liver, Glucagon stimulates PKA, Adrenaline stimulates PKA and
$Ca^{2+}$ release into cytosol, increasing glycogenolysis to produce glucose that muscle can access

# Upregulation of Glycolysis

- Apart from ‚Üë supply of glucose, regulatory enzymes of glycolysis must also ‚Üë their activity in order to increase the rate of ATP Production and Metabolism/activity

### Hexokinase

- Inhibited by Glucose-6-P (Its product)
- This inhibition of Hexokinase by G6P is relieved as rate of glycolysis increases as G-6-P will be used up at a fast rate, preventing a significant [G6P]

### Phosphofructokinase-1

- It is activated by ‚Üë in [AMP] (due to the activity of Adenylate Kinase when there is a high rate of ATP usage).
- Any fructose-6-P that accumulates (Due to PFK-1 not catalysing its reaction fast enough), this excess F6P is converted to F 2,6-bisP which is a potent activator of PFK-1 to increase its rate to reduce the accumulation of F6P

### Pyruvate Kinase

- Activated by ‚Üë in AMP.
- Any built up in F 1,6-bisP (Product of PFK-1) also activates it (feed-forward activation as PFK-1 Activation increases [F1,6-bisP], which increases Pyruvate Kinase Activity )
- Occurrence of fatty acid oxidation (E.g In Type I Muscle Fibres) has a ‚Äìve effect on rate of glycolysis, slowing it down and causing glycogen stores to last longer during exercise

### Glycolysis in Exercise

1. In exercise, increased muscular contraction causes ‚Üë [AMP] due to Adenylate Kinase activity
2. This increases the activity of Glycogen Phosphorylase (increases rate of Glycogenolysis), PFK-1 and Pyruvate Kinase
3. Increased Activity of PFK-1 causes ‚Üë[F 1,6-bisP], which ‚Üë activity of Pyruvate Kinase
4. ‚Üë Activity of PFK-1 causes ‚Üì [F6P] and [G6P], causing reduced Inhibition of Hexokinase, increasing its activity
5. ‚Üë [F6P] due to Increased Hexokinase activity and Glycogenolysis causes ‚Üë[F 2,6-bisP] via PFK-2 Activity (if PFK-1 is saturated)
6. ‚Üë [F 2,6-bisP] activates PFK-1 and increases its activity
- The overall effect is a significant increase in the rate of Glycolysis during exercise

![Screenshot 2021-09-27 at 17.47.50.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-27_at_17.47.50.png)

# Phosphofructokinase-1

- PFK-1 is central/most important regulatory enzyme in glycolysis, as it determines activity of Hexokinase and Pyruvate Kinase via its impacts on [G6P] (which impacts Hexokinase activity) and [F 1,6-bisP] (which impacts Hexokinase activity)
- One substrate of PFK-1 is ATP, but high [ATP] inhibits PFK-1, causing ‚Üì activity
- When AMP is present in sufficient quantity, it prevents ATP from inhibiting PFK-1 despite High [ATP]
- Therefore, F6P is better able to bind to PFK-1 if there is Low [ATP] or there is High [ATP] and [AMP] due to a lack of ATP Inhibition. However, due to the various mechanisms to maintain a constantly High [ATP] in muscle cells, Low [ATP] rarely happens.
- When [ATP] is high, and [Phosphocreatine] is high (AMP is low), the inhibition of PFK-1 shuts down Glycolysis
- If fatty acids are being oxidised, citrate also inhibits PFK-1

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 23.42.14.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_23.42.14.png)

# Low to Moderate Intensity Exercise

- At lower intensity contractions, oxidative metabolism can produce ATP at the necessary rates to meet the needs of the contracting muscles.
- For these contractions, FA oxidation is more suitable than TCA/ETC as glucose is a more precious fuel than FAs as glucose stores (Glycogen) are limited whilst large quantities of TAGs can be stored
- Unlike Glycolysis, Fatty acid oxidation is regulated in terms of supply of substrates/FAs only, not by enzyme regulation within pathway itself.
- The release of stored fatty acids (lipolysis of TAG) is increased in exercise, both from adipose tissue and intra-muscular TAG droplets
- Uptake into muscle mitochondria also increases during exercise
- This is also affected by other factors such as fed/fasting state, exercise duration, training etc.

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 23.42.56.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_23.42.56.png)

# Release of Fatty Acids

- During exercise, Adrenaline stimulates release of fatty acids from
triacylglycerol stored in adipose tissue around body
- Muscle also contains droplets of triacylglycerol whose fatty acids are released in same way
- Fatty acids entering muscle cells need to enter mitochondria before oxidation
- Entry is allowed by relieving inhibition of CPT I
- In fed state, Perilipin A shields the outer surface of the TAG from Hormone Sensitive Lipase, promoting storage (prevents Lipases from contacting the TAG droplet surface and breaking it down)
- In the fed state, Hormone Sensitive Lipase is inhibited and not at the site of action (away from the TAG droplet), preventing it from Digesting the Cytosolic TAG droplets
- When Adrenaline bind to cell surface receptors or Insulin is low, intracellular signals are initiated that activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).
- These phosphorylate Hormone Sensitive Lipase, which activates the enzyme and causes it to migrate towards the surface of the TAG droplet.
- It also phosphorylates Perilipin A, leading to a conformational change which causes Perilipin A to dissociated from the TAG, allowing Hormone Sensitive Lipase to break down the TAG Droplet

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 23.43.30.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_23.43.30.png)

- Hormone Sensitive Lipase removes FAs from TAG at the Sn1 and Sn3 positions to form 2 FAs and 2-MAG.
- MAG Lipase removes the FA from 2-MAG to form FA and Glycerol
- MAG Lipase is not regulated but it is dependent on the action of and hence, indirectly regulated by Hormone Sensitive Lipase
- This process occurs in Adipocytes (Cells with a single, large fat droplet) and Muscle Cells (Cells with multiple, smaller droplets distributed throughout the cell.)
- In Muscle Cells, FFAs can be used directly by the cell in FA Oxidation and In Adipose Tissues, the FFAs are released into the blood stream, where muscle cells can then take them up

![Screenshot 2021-09-27 at 20.09.39.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-27_at_20.09.39.png)

- FAs are hydrophobic so they can diffuse across the plasma membrane into the cell or enter the cell via facilitated diffusion with carriers to increase the rate of FFA influx
- When inside cells, FFAs can act as detergents or can diffuse back out of the cell so therefore, they must be safely stored within the cell
- Therefore, to prevent the FFAs from harming the cell, they are esterified to Coenzyme A using ATP, catalysed by Fatty Acyl CoA Synthetases that found on organelle membranes
- Due to the size of the CoA group, the movement of Fatty Acyl CoA throughout the cell can be regulated unlike that of FFAs (it cannot diffuse through organelle membranes)

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 23.44.43.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_23.44.43.png)

# Fatty Acid Entry into the Mitochondria

- Fatty acyl CoA cannot cross inner mitochondrial membrane, unless it has been converted to Acyl Carnitine by CPT I on the OMM
- The Acyl Carnitine can then diffuse across the OMM and be transported across the IMM in exchange for a free Carnitine, transported by CACT (Carnitine Acyl Carnitine Translocase)
- When inside the Mitochondrial Matrix, CPT II on the Inner Side of the IMM, Acyl Carnitine is converted back into Fatty Acyl CoA, using CoASH, which can then be oxidised to reform the FA

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 23.45.40.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_23.45.40.png)

---

# Control of CPT I

- FA Entry into the Mitochondria is regulated by CPT I and the rate at which Acyl Carnitine can enter the Mitochondria and be used to reform Fatty Acyl CoA
- Acetyl CoA carboxylase catalyses conversion of acetyl CoA to Malonyl CoA.
- Whilst Malonyl CoA can be used for FA Synthesis in Adipose Tissue, in skeletal muscle, it is produced solely to regulate and inhibit CPT I
- Malonyl CoA is an inhibitor of CPT I. Thus, CPT I is controlled by regulating Acetyl CoA Carboxylase (Inhibition of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase increases CPT I Activity)
- This regulation can occur by:
1. Positive Allosteric Regulation - High levels of Cytosolic Citrate indicates that fuels are being metabolised at a greater rate than is required for cellular functions. Citrate binds to dimeric inactive Acetyl CoA Carboxylase to form the Active Polymeric Chain form
2. Negative Allosteric Regulation by FA - When there is a large supply of FAs (Fasting etc.), the FAs inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase by causing the chain form of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase to break down into an inactive dimeric form
3. Covalent Regulation - AMPK is a kinase activated by AMP (produced during exercise) so when ‚Üë[AMP], AMPK is activated and phosphorylates Acetyl CoA Carboxylase in either the Dimeric or Polymeric form to place it in the Inactive Monomeric Form
- Fatty acids and AMPK inhibit Acetyl CoA Carboxylase and Citrate activates Acetyl CoA Carboxylase
- The Covalent Regulation of Acetyl CoA Carboxylase by AMPK (stimulated during exercise) can override the Allosteric Regulation provided by FA/Citrate in the Fasting/Fed State respectively
- When transitioning between Metabolic States (Fed and Fasting etc.), [Malonyl CoA] is altered by Malonyl CoA Decarboxylase (Converts Malonyl CoA into Acetyl CoA) in order to alter the ability for FAs to enter the Mitochondria and be oxidised
- Malonyl CoA Decarboxylase is Activated by AMPK (during Exercise), to decrease [Malonyl CoA] to allow FA Oxidation to occur at faster rates

# Acetyl CoA and Glucose Metabolism

- Generally, as FA Metabolism increases, Glucose Metabolism decreases
- In Muscles, FA Metabolism is prioritised over Glucose Metabolism as Fat Stores in Adipose Tissue is much greater than Glucose Stores (Glycogen) and once a muscle fibre has used its muscle glycogen store, it is exhausted and can no longer contract
- The use of fatty acids as a fuel results in an increase in acetyl CoA production
- Large amounts of Acetyl CoA inhibit and redirect metabolism of glucose and glycogen:
1. Acetyl CoA inhibits Pyruvate Kinase (final regulatory enzyme in glycolysis)
2. Large amounts of Acetyl CoA cause Citrate to enter Cytosol where it inhibits PFK-1
3. Cytosolic Citrate inhibits both Pyruvate Kinase and Phosphofructokinase-1
4. Inhibition of PFK-1, causes an accumulation G-6-P, which inhibits Hexokinase and Glycogen Phosphorylase, shutting down Glycolysis and Glycogenolysis respectively
- Result is that use of fatty acid as a fuel slows the rate at which glycogen is used up, thereby delaying onset of exhaustion by preserving glycogen stores

# Respiratory Quotients

- Gives ratio of $CO_2$ produced to $O_2$ used ($RQ = \frac{VCO_2}{VO_2}$)
- As Carbohydrates are relatively oxygen rich in comparison to Fats (which is a more reduced compound due to a lack of O atoms attached to the main chain), Fat molecules require more oxygen to produce the same amount of $CO_2$ than Carbohydrates
- Estimates percentage of carbohydrate vs fat used in different metabolic states or different types of exercise
- Lower RQ will suggest that a greater % of fuel is being derived from fats vs carbohydrates

![Screenshot 2021-09-26 at 23.49.49.png](%5B023%5D%20Control%20of%20Fuel%20Selection%20in%20Muscles%20dabd7773bea94f3797c1685d332d6126/Screenshot_2021-09-26_at_23.49.49.png)

- $% of Energy Derived from Carbohydrates =$ % of Energy Derived from Carbohydrates = $\frac{(RQ-0.707)}{(1-0.707)}\times100$
- 0.707 is the RQ for fat oxidation
- 1 is the RQ for carbohydrate oxidation
- % fat use/metabolism ‚Üë with training and fasting vs untrained and fed
- A lack of % change in RQ between metabolic states in an individual is often a sign of poor metabolic health (E.g Diabetes or other metabolic syndromes)

- RQ after 45 min exercise at moderate intensity (40% $VO_{2 max}$)

---

# Effects of Training

- For anaerobic exercise, the size of type II fibres increases, leading to an increase in the bulk of muscle (due to synthesis of more Type II Fibres) and glycogen storage also increases to facilitate these stronger muscle contractions
- For aerobic exercise, the changes are more varied:
1. ‚Üë in Glycogen Synthase activity (This is because an increase in the size of glycogen stores/glycogen produced improves muscle endurance)
2. ‚Üë in density of capillaries supplying muscle - Increases Oxygen and Metabolic Fuel supply to the muscles to maximise aerobic activity
3. ‚Üë expression of fatty acid transport protein - Increase FA Transport into muscle cells where they can be oxidised
4. ‚Üë AMPK activity (‚Üë capacity to oxidise fats by reducing [Malonyl CoA], reducing the inhibition of CPT I)
5. ‚Üë in size and number (up to 5x) of mitochondria
6. ‚Üë in activity of TCA and FA oxidation enzymes
- These changes increase the capacity of the muscle fibre to oxidise fats and spare glycogen (prolong glycogen stores
- Changes brought about by exercise are temporary and reversed if the exercise regime stops, with a lack of exercise/movement weakening the muscle and reducing its capacity to spare glycogen and oxidise FA
- In situations where muscle is not used (e.g. incapacitation due to severe injuries), number of mitochondria ‚Üì 10% of average sedentary individuals.
- The maximal power that can be generated in a muscle fibre weakened from inactivity is 120 W (compared to 10 W of resting muscle and 3,600 W for sprint).
- The Mechanisms behind these changes are not well known
