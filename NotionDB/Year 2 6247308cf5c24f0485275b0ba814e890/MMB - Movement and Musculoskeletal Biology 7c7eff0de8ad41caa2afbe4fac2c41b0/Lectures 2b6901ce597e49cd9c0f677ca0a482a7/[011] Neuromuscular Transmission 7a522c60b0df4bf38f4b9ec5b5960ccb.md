# [011] Neuromuscular Transmission

# Overview

- Skeletal muscles contract under control of CNS
- Babies can do at least 2 things at birth:
1. Breathing due to the diaphragm muscle
2. Vocalisation due to the laryngeal muscles (vocal cords)

---

# Early Steps in The Formation of the Neuromuscular Junction

- Neural crest cells form myoblasts and Schwann Cells
- These NCCs (uninucleate) migrate and fuse to form myotubes, which are multinucleate cells and the longest cell in the body
- Schwann cells from NCCs migrate and grow towards the Myotubes
- Nerve Terminals/Growth Cones Schwann Cells contact muscle fibre after the fusion of myoblasts to form multinucleated Myotubes.
- Processes grow out of neural tube and these form motor axons, which travels down the Schwann Cell to form Synaptic Boutons where it contacts the Muscle Fibre
- As the junction between the Nerve Cells and the Muscle Fibre matures, the mature (stable and strong) Neuromuscular Junction/NMJ is formed which allows for nervous control of muscle activity
- This is comprised of the Muscle Fibre and the Nerve Terminals which are surrounded/overlain and supported by Schwann Cells

# ACh Receptor Structure Switching and Clustering as Neuromuscular Junction Forms

### Clustering of AChRs as NMJ Forms

- This increases the sensitivity of the Muscle Fibre to ACh to allow for it to be effectively stimulated/inhibited by the nervous system (allows for nervous communication/transmission with the muscle)
- When the nerve terminal of the motor neurone contacts the muscle fibre, it spontaneously releases ACh
- The sensitivity of muscle depends on the presence of ACh receptor on the Muscle Fibre Membrane near the nerve terminal (it is pentamer having 5 subunits, 2Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, Œ¥)
- ACh receptors are initially widely distributed across the entire surface of the Muscle Fibre where nuclei are found
- After birth and muscle fibre innervation, these receptors are localised/focused in expression to the region of the Muscle Fibre that is in contact with the Nerve Terminal (NMJ), with muscle fibres not being expressed elsewhere along the fibres length
- This means that a muscle is not sensitive to ACh across its entire length, but only at the NMJ
- Nerve Damage means that in order to reinnervate and restore function/nervous control to that muscle fibre, a NMJ must be reformed (occurs slowly).
- This process is facilitated only if the original NMJ is intact and indamaged
- Agrin released from nerve terminal, binds to MuSK on the Muscle Fibre.
- This changes the gene expression of nuclei under nerve terminal and controls clustering of ACh receptors at NMJs but not at other nuclei along the muscle fibre length
- Agrin-MuSK signalling is also involved in Basal Lamina Formation related to muscle fibres to mechanically support the muscle fibre during active contraction

### ACh receptor structure: ùú∏ to ùùê switch

- AChRs are pentamers, with various different subunits with different functional and pharmacological properties.
- In the embryo, it is Œ±‚ÇÇŒ≤Œ≥Œ¥Œµ
- In the AChRs, the 2 Œ± subunits are separated by the Œ≥/Œµ subunit in the embryo/adult respectively and 2 Œ≤ subunits.
- The 2 ACh molecules bind to the Œ± subunit, close to the junction between Œ±:Œ¥ and Œ±:Œ≥/Œµ
- ùõæ subunit found in embryo.
- This switches to ùúñ subunit shortly after birth (expression of ùõæ subunit changes to ùúñ  subunit after birth)

# Transition from Multiple to Focal Transmission

- Initially, the Phrenic Nerve innervates the diaphragm by passing through the middle of the Muscle.
- As the Diaphragm grows, innervation of the diaphragm develops via small branches that contact individual muscle fibres.
- Each muscle fibre is initially connected by around 3 nerve terminals in utero (polyneural connections).
- This is so If any of these nerve contact fails, the others can take over to maintain nervous control of the muscle.
- After birth, number of contacts per fibre ‚Üì due to competition between Nerve Terminals causing down-regulation/elimination of less-functional/dominant nerve terminals.
- After 3 weeks there are monosynaptic connections between nerves and muscle fibres (1 Nerve Terminal per fibre)
- This establishes pattern of innervation of muscle fibre for rest of life, for almost all muscle fibres except the Extra-Occular Muscles.
- Extra-occular muscles remain innervated by multiple fibres after birth
- Motor Unit = Number of Muscle Fibres contacted by a single Motor Neuron AKA Number of Terminal branches/Nerve Terminals of a Motor Neuron
- Schwann Cells produce Myelin which insulates the axon to increase conduction velocity via Saltatory Conduction and support the nerve, notably its regrowth into the muscle fibre when damaged
- The Motor unit size determines the precision of movement; muscles involved in highly precise movements have smaller motor units:
1) Temporalis muscle: motor unit ùëõ = 500 (large). Does not require fine motor control. This produces gross but not fine motor control as this produces large movements upon stimulation of the motor unit (lots of fibres contract)
2) Extra-occular muscle: motor unit ùëõ = 5 (small). Allows fine control of eye as small movements are produced by stimulation of this motor unit (few fibres contract)

# Neuromuscular Junction

- Near the Muscle Fibre, the nerve axon divides into multiple branches, each with its own Nerve Terminal that contacts the muscle fibre
- Muscle Fibres are focally innervated (Muscle Fibres are innervated at a specific point on the length of the Muscle Fibre vs widespread innervation along the entire fibre)
- The NMJ is sometimes described as en grappe as the Nerve Terminals appear grape-like, budding off from the main axon
- The NMJ is comprised of a nerve terminal where ACh can be released and the folded and highly specialised post-synaptic Sarcolemma (Motor End Plate) on the Muscle Fibre, where AChRs are localised to.

![Screenshot 2021-09-16 at 13.33.26.png](%5B011%5D%20Neuromuscular%20Transmission%207a522c60b0df4bf38f4b9ec5b5960ccb/Screenshot_2021-09-16_at_13.33.26.png)

- The Nerve Terminal has a high activity (with lots of Mitochondria to power synthesis, storage and release of ACh in Vesicles, collected above release sites/active zones in the Nerve Terminal)
- The region of the muscle fibre where the Nerve Terminal contacts the Muscle is known as the Motor End Plate
- The Post-synaptic membrane (Motor End Plate) is thrown into folds.
- On these folds ACh receptors aggregate/clusters and are found and localised, right at the region where they would be most sensitive to released neurotransmitter.
- Active zones (where ACh is released from) are aligned on pre-synaptic side, opposite/adjacent to the aggregation of AChRs.
- Acetylcholinesterase is responsible for breaking down ACh to terminate its stimulatory effect and is also found close to the AChR aggregates in the junctional clefts of the post-synaptic membrane/Motor End Plate.
- At base of the junctional folds are voltage-dependent Na‚Å∫ channels. These initiate the muscle action potential and cause the muscle fibre to twitch.
- ‚ÄòAll or nothing‚Äô principle (Action Potential either happens at full/complete magnitude or not at all based on whether the signal is large enough or not AKA Strength of stimulus is not proportional to magnitude of action potential

# The Vesicle Cycle

1. Vesicles form from intracellular membrane. Filled with ACh, and collect in an active zone.
2. When action potential arrives at the presynaptic membrane, vesicle fuses with terminal membrane, and ACh is released into synaptic cleft, causing [ACh] to rise rapidly.
3. Vesicles then re-captured, re-filled and re-used again to continue the cycle.
- One Vesicle Cycle can last seconds-minutes but the sheer number of Vesicles in the Nerve Terminals means that even at high activity, there will always be ACh vesicles available

# Quantal Release of Neurotransmitters at NMJ

- Neurotransmitter is released into a synapse in a packaged vesicle called a quanta.
- 1 quanta of ACh generates a miniature end plate potential (MEPP) which is smallest amount of stimulation 1 neuron can send to another neuron (stimulation produced by amount of neurotransmitter in 1 vesicle).
- Spontaneous MEPPs are caused by the spontaneous release of ACh from Nerve Terminals
- MEPPs summate on one another following the synchronised/simultaneous release of multiple Vesicles (due to an AP propagating down a Motor Axon)
- The sum of many MEPPs is known as an end plate potential (EPP).
- Muscle Action Potential is usually around 100 mV whereas MEPPs are usually around 1 mV
- A normal EPP usually causes the postsynaptic neuron/muscle fibre to reach its threshold of excitation and elicit/triggers an action potential.
- After an EPP triggers a muscle action potential, it is conducted along the surface of the muscle fibre to produce a contraction/muscle twitch
- MEPPs are only observed when nerve touches muscle (at the NMJ), and nowhere else as this is the only region of the Muscle where ACh is released and stimulating the muscle fibre.
- This means that when an electrode is placed away from the NMJ, only the muscle action potential which propagates down the muscle fibre can be recorded, and not MEPPs.

# Initiation of Muscle Contraction

1. ACh binds to AChRs, which triggers an action potential in the sarcolemma
2. This action potential is conducted down T-tubules into the muscle fibre.
3. In the Muscle Fibre, the voltage change caused by the AP is detected by the T-Tubule Dihydropyridine Receptor (Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channel), which directly connects to Sarcoplasmic Reticulum.
4. Dihydropyridine receptor   undergoes a conformational change and transmits this change to sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor (RyR2) (Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channel)
5. Ca¬≤‚Å∫ is released from the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum via the opened ryanodine receptors and onto the Myofibrils, allowing rapid skeletal muscle contraction

# Fast and Slow-Twitch Fibres

- Motor neurons have a trophic effect on muscle, controlling muscle gene expression and hence, muscle size and function.
- Most muscles contain a mixture of fast (white) and slow-twitch (red) muscle fibres determined by expression of the contractile proteins, troponin I, determined by motor neurone activity (associated with exercise).
- Colour determined by presence of myoglobin.

### Slow Fibres

- Aerobic, endurance muscles
- Expresses ùõº-actinin II and troponin I slow (TnIs)
- Example: soleus muscle

### Fast fibres:

- Partly anaerobic
- Expresses ùõº-actinin II, ùõº-actinin III and troponin I fast
(TnIf)
- Example: tibialis anterior
- Denervation results in complete loss of fast and slow muscle phenotypes as muscles atrophy under denervation

---

# Strength of Muscle Contraction

- Contraction strength is controlled by CNS
- Strength of contraction depends on number of motor units activated and synchrony of their activation, both of which are controlled by the CNS.
- Each individual muscle fibre contracts with a twitch
- Stimulating Œ≤-AR on muscle causes twitch to be faster, so contraction is less smooth, so there is trembling.
- This is evident in people with shock, where there is a large amount of adrenaline.
- Asynchrony of motor unit activation allows the controlled gradual/stepwise generation of steady muscle contraction of varying strength, depending on frequency of motor neuron action potentials (around 5-25 Hz)
- Laryngeal nerves can have very high frequency action potentials whereas Phrenic Nerve usually has a medium frequency action potential

---

# Muscle Response to Rapid Stimulation

- A single nervous stimulus causes a twitch.
- If the second stimulus occurs before first muscle has relaxed (while the muscle is still contracted), the twitch and muscle tension is summated
- As stimulation frequency is ‚Üë (around 25 Hz), this causes a partially fused tetanus (jerky/not smooth)
- As the frequency of stimulation ‚Üë (around 100 Hz), There is very little relaxation before the fibre is next stimulated. This causes a larger increase in Tension with each summation but this increase is more smooth, producing a fused tetanus (smooth)

# Force-Velocity Relation for a Skeletal Muscle

- Power relation: in between 40% shortening is when your muscle would be able to generate
maximum power
- Forming a cross-bridge takes a finite amount of time, as a result, when speed of filaments sliding ‚Üë (‚Üë contraction velocity), force/tension generated ‚Üì as there is less time for cross-bridges to form, and fewer form as a result.
- In contrast, if filament velocity ‚Üì, more cross-bridges have time to attach and more force is generated as a result.
- Below a certain shortening velocity, there is slower filament sliding, meaning the filaments slide a shorter distance over one another, forming less crossbridges and hence, less tension
- In general, the greatest power is developed when muscle is shortening at about 1/3 of its maximum rate/velocity.

# Effect of Muscle Length on the Development of Muscle Tension

- There is a normal working range for muscles where high tension is generated, but the muscle can be damaged when stretched beyond this so that muscle filaments no longer overlap and no muscle tension is generated upon stimulation until the myofibrils can rearrange themselves into their original positions and repair the damage.
- Passive tension is when muscle fibres themselves stretch beyond their resting length. With passive tension, tension ‚Üë as passive tension ‚Üë.
- Active tension is extra tension generated as result of a stimulus. Here, active tension reaches its maximum when the muscle fibre is at its resting length.

# Neuromuscular Block

- NMJ blockers are frequency dependent and produce a more profound block as the frequency of nerve impulses increases. As a result, tetanic contraction are more readily blocked by NMJ blockers such as atracurium.
- Atracurium blocks the ACh binding site on the AChR of the Motor End Plate, preventing the generation of the EPP and the Muscle AP subsequently.
- Edrophonium (Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor) reverses the Neuromuscular Block produced by drugs like Atracurium
- This is important in anaesthetics as the laryngeal muscles (high frequency APs) are paralyzed before the diaphragm (low frequency APs), which gives the anaesthetist time to intubate the patient due to relaxation of the Laryngeal Muscles before the Px loses their ability to breath by themselves.

---

# Margin of Safety - The Iceberg Effect

- Iceberg effect: 75% of ACh receptors need to be blocked before neuromuscular transmission begins to be blocked and muscle twitch/tension decreases.
- This makes neuromuscular transmission reliable, with a large margin of safety before transmission is blocked.
- This is because lots of AChRs are present but only relatively few of these are required for normal transmission as the EPP that is generated is much larger than needed to reach the threshold for AP generation in the muscle fibre.
- Some diseases (E.g Myasthenia Gravis - Auto-Ab vs AChR) can interrupt this and decrease this margin of safety, causing problems with breathing and muscle weakness.
- About 5 times as much ACh is released from nerve terminal as is needed to just evoke a muscle fibre action potential. EPP is much bigger than needed to reach threshold for action potential generation in muscle fibre.
- Complete twitch block occurs at 95% receptor block
- After giving patient NMJ blockers, important to give drugs to reverse NMJ blocker. Even though patient recovers, it is possible that up to 75% of AChRs are blocked. Occasionally, there can be reappearance of NMJ blocker in patient‚Äôs system (recurarisation) which would then cause them to exceed 75% blocking, causing EPP to ‚Üì. This can paralyse respiratory muscles.
- Recurarisation occurs as the reversal drug (endrophonium) has a smaller half-life than NMJ blocker, allowing the effects of the NMJ blocker to persist after the reversal drug has been cleared.

# Clinical Examples of Muscle Weakness

- Myasthenia Gravis: autoimmune loss of AChRs
- Neuromuscular block by blocking AChRs: poisoning by venomous snake of elapid species (e.g. sea snakes and cobras). Venom contains ùú∂ toxins like ùú∂- bungarotoxin. This causes respiratory depression and can lead due to Asphyxiation due to paralysis of the Diaphragm
- Nicotine insecticide poisoning: desensitisation of AChRs and depolarising neuromuscular block

# Mechanisms of Neuromuscular Transmission

### Presynaptic - Nerve Terminal

1. AP travels down Motor Neuron to arrive at the Presynaptic Nerve Terminal, depolarising it
2. This depolarisation activates Voltage-Gated Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Channels in Active Zones (Regions of the Terminal Membrane specialised for transmitter release), causing Ca¬≤‚Å∫ influx into the Nerve
3. Ca¬≤‚Å∫ influx initiates vesicle fusion with the presynaptic membrane and the release of ACh into the Synaptic Cleft
- 20-100 ACh vesicles are released during this process
- Each vesicle contains around 5000 ACh molecules

### Postsynaptic - NMJ

1. Following the release of ACh into the Synaptic Cleft, [ACh] rises to around 1mM in < 100 ¬µS
2. ACh binds to AChR on the Postsynaptic Membrane, causing the Channel in the AChR to open
3. Na‚Å∫ flows through the channel into the Muscle Fibre, depolarising the cell membrane potential to generate an EPP
4. EPP crosses the AP Threshold for the Muscle and initiates a muscle Action Potential, which triggers muscle contraction/twitch
- The AChR Channels close and ACh dissociates from AChR within 1-2 ms
