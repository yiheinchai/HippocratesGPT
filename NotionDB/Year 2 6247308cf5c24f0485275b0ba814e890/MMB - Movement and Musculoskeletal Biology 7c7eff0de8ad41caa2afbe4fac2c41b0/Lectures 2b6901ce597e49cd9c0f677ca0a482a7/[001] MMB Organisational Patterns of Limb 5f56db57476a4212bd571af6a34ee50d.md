# [001] MMB Organisational Patterns of Limb

# Limb Development

- The limbs are specialised protuberances of segments of the body wall (which originate from Somites)
- The upper limb consists of body wall segments, nerves etc. that are associated with C5 to T1
- The lower limb consists of body wall segments, nerves etc. that are associated with L1 to S3
- The thorax and abdomen are body cavities that are filled with spaces. However, in the limbs, there is no cavity involved in limb formation (they arise exclusively from the body wall) so body cavities are not involved in limb formation
- During development, Limbs consist of protuberances of ectoderm from the body wall which is filled with mesoderm
- The ectoderm becomes the striated muscle and its innervation
- The mesoderm becomes the bones, tendons, vasculature, fascia and dermis

# Tetrapod Limb Radiation

- Humans are classified as tetrapods
- Tetrapods are vertebrates (e.g. organisms with vertebral columns) that have four limbs
- Tetrapod Radiation has produced a wide variety of limbs adapted to all possible types of locomotion.
- This has occurred via the reshaping the fin-like appendices of fish-like ancestors by evolution to produce a wide variety of limb types (Different number of digits/rays etc.)
- In order for organisms to transition from living in an aquatic environment to living on land, a mechanism of lifting and moving the body was required
- During this transition, limbs with many different rays/digits were produced (from multi-rayed aquatic animals, to 7-rayed animals) but the 5-ray tetrapod limb seemed to be the most evolutionarily successful form
- All living tetrapods share a 5-rayed tetrapod limb

### Pattern of Tetrapod Limbs

- Human limbs are the product of a long process of evolution, which reshaped the fin-shaped appendages of fish like ancestors
- All tetrapod limbs have a central bony axis, which is surrounded by muscles and neurovascular structures, connected with joints to increase mobility
- Like all other tetrapods, Humans have the same pattern of composition of the central bony axis of the upper and lower limbs but the individual elements are differently shaped in different limb types:
1. There is a single proximal element to the body (Stylopod):
- In the upper limb this is the humerus
- In the lower limb this is the femur
1. There are 2 middle elements (Zeugopod), which are the Radius (lateral) and Ulna (medial) in the UL and Tibia and Fibula in the LL
2. Multiple distal bony elements (Autopod). These are the 8/7 Carpal/Tarsal bones in the UL and LL respectively and the 14 phalanges
- This distal end is the most variable amongst organisms
- The phalanges form the rays

# Evolutionary Pattern Changes in Limb Muscle Organisation

- Alongside the central axis of limbs, the Muscle groups that move the various elements of the bony central axis have also undergone reorganisation over time.
- The hypothetical tetrapod fish ancestor swam in water, so it had fins that pointed out laterally to the side of the body that were used for floating and propulsion in the water
- These fins had a pre and postaxial borders, which form the sharp edges of the fin found anteriorly and posteriorly to the Central Axis respectively
- Dorsal muscles are responsible for extension (lifting the limb). These originate from and remain on the Dorsal Aspect of the Limb in fish ancestor
- Ventral muscles are responsible for flexion (lowering the limb). These originate from and remain on the Ventral Aspect of the Limb in fish ancestor

![Screenshot 2021-08-28 at 16.55.36.png](%5B001%5D%20MMB%20Organisational%20Patterns%20of%20Limb%205f56db57476a4212bd571af6a34ee50d/Screenshot_2021-08-28_at_16.55.36.png)

- As living on land places different locomotive requirements on the limbs vs living in underwater, the limb central axis bones of animals living on dry land must be reorganised to lift the body off the ground so that it could be pushed forward to produce movement
- This is done by introducing joints and bending the central axis (bone element of the limb) almost 90° so that the proximal segment extends laterally and the distal segment extends inferiorly so that the hands and feet point laterally whilst the thumb points anteriorly
- This does not disturb the original Dorsal and Ventral compartmentalisation of muscles, the location of the Pre and Postaxial Borders and the movements produced by these muscle compartments

![Screenshot 2021-08-28 at 17.05.39.png](%5B001%5D%20MMB%20Organisational%20Patterns%20of%20Limb%205f56db57476a4212bd571af6a34ee50d/Screenshot_2021-08-28_at_17.05.39.png)

- After the bending of the central axis, the entirety of the limbs are rotated 90° around the central axis, with the lower limb rotating backwards (so that the distal segment points posteriorly vs inferiorly) and the upper limb rotating forward (so that the distal segment points anteriorly vs inferiorly).
- This causes the dorsal and ventral muscles + the pre and post-axial borders to follow this rotation pattern
- This anterior rotation of the UL means that whilst the distal portion of the upper limb now points anteriorly, the palm points anteriorly
- To fix this, there is a permanent pronation of the forearm so that the palm now points posteriorly whilst reorganising the muscle compartments so that dorsal muscles are now found in the front of the pronated limb
- As the leg is already pointing forwards (due to the initial rotation), so no pronation of the leg is needed to make the leg point forwards
- After this, the limbs rotate 90° medially (not around the central axis) so that the limbs are placed under the body and point inferiorly rather than sticking out laterally

# Pattern of Adult Dorso-Ventral Muscle Group Distribution

- Ventral Muscle groups are found on anterior aspect of the trunk and upper limb before spiralling onto the Medial Aspect of the Thigh and the Posterior aspect of the leg.
- Ventral Muscles cause flexion whilst Dorsal Muscles cause extension
- Dorsal Muscle groups are found on the posterior aspect of the trunk and upper limb and also spiral onto the posterolateral and anterolateral aspect of the thigh (they do not extend down onto the anterior aspect of the leg)
- Humans have very long thighs
- This is because of the backwards rotation of the limb around its central axis and the medial rotation of the lower limb to put it under the body

# Upper Limb Muscle Groups - Movements

- This follows dorsal/ventral muscle group movements as expected

### Ventral Muscles

- The flexors of the shoulder, elbow and wrist are found on the ventral/anterior side of the shoulder, arm and forearm + hand respectively.

### Dorsal Muscles

- The extensors of the shoulder, elbow and wrist are found on the dorsal/posterior side of the shoulder, arm and forearm respectively

# Lower Limb Muscle Groups - Movements

### Ventral Muscles

- Hip Flexors and Adductors of the leg are found on the anteromedial aspect of the thigh
- Knee Flexors are found on the posterior aspect of the Knee, both proximal and distal to the Knee Joint
- Ankle and Toe Flexors (Plantarflexors) are found on the posterior aspect of the leg and the sole/plantar aspect of the foot
- Adduction uses Hip Flexor Muscles and some Hip extensor muscles and hence, uses both Ventral and Dorsal Muscles respectively

### Dorsal Muscles

- Hip Extensors and Abductors of the Leg (Found deep to Gluteus Maximus) are found on the posterior aspect of the thigh
- Knee extensors are found on the anterior aspect of the thigh
- Ankle and toes extensors (Dorsiflexors) are found on the lateral aspect of the leg and the dorsum of the foot

# Embryology of Limb Rotation in Humans

- Limb buds emerge at around Week 5 and the limbs appear fin-like in terms of dorsal/ventral muscle group arrangements as dorsal/ventral to the limb axis. They also project laterally
- At week 6, the 90° bend in the elbow and knee joints are introduced which allows the body to be lifted off the ground.
- This means that the proximal limb (knees and elbows) projects laterally whilst the distal limb (palms and soles) projects medially
- Like in Tetrapods, the introduction of this bend does not alter the distribution of the Dorsal and Ventral Muscles
- In week 7, the limbs rotate 90° around their central axis, with the UL rotating 90° anteriorly/forwards and the LL rotating 90° posteriorly/backwards.
- This means that instead of projecting laterally, the elbows point caudally/inferiorly and the knees point superiorly/cranially
- From week 8 onwards, there is a 90° rotation mediolaterally so the thigh rotates inwards so that the limbs are moved underneath the trunk

![Screenshot 2021-08-28 at 16.18.13.png](%5B001%5D%20MMB%20Organisational%20Patterns%20of%20Limb%205f56db57476a4212bd571af6a34ee50d/Screenshot_2021-08-28_at_16.18.13.png)

# Segmental Innervation - Development

- The limbs develop from body segments/somites that give rise to bone, muscle and the overlying skin.
- Each of these segments has motor and sensory innervation as well as autonomic innervation for the SNS Innervation of the limbs
- Myotome = Group of Muscles who receive their motor innervation from a single spinal nerve
- As the limbs grow, the Dermatomes (from the associated body wall segments) get pulled along with them from their corresponding dermatomes on the body wall
- Reorganisation and rotation of the limbs during embryonic development further alters the distribution of the dermatomes on the limb:
1. In week 5, the Dermatomes of the Limb bud become stretched as the limb buds grow laterally, causing the dermatomes at the tip of the Forelimb Limb Buds (C7 and C8) to lose contact with their corresponding dermatomes on the trunk
2. In week 6, the dermatomes are stretched along the first bending of the Central Axis
3. In week 7-8, the rotations of the limb + pronation of the forearm cause the dermatomes to spiral down the limbs, causing the pre and postaxial borders to move towards one another on the lower limb.
- This is most noticeable on the lower limbs

![Screenshot 2021-08-28 at 16.22.14.png](%5B001%5D%20MMB%20Organisational%20Patterns%20of%20Limb%205f56db57476a4212bd571af6a34ee50d/Screenshot_2021-08-28_at_16.22.14.png)

# Development of Limb Dermatome Patterns

- On the trunk, there is a clear viscerotopic organisation/'stacking' of Dermatomes where the dermatomes of more superior spinal levels are found more superiorly on the trunk.
- This is because the ribs in the trunk keep the spinal nerves separated so that these nerves innervate distinct regions
- As a general rule, the lower down the spinal segment, the further distal and inferior the dermatome will be and vice-versa
- The higher up on the limb/more superior on the trunk, the higher the number of the segment
- On the posterior aspect of the arm, C5-7 are found just lateral to T1 which is found directly medially, separated by the curved Posterior and Anterior Axial Lines, formed from the reorganisation of the Post and Preaxial Borders respectively
- On the posterior aspect of the LL, the Anterior and Posterior Axial lines converge and are found quite close to one another as the Dorsal Musculature and its innervations are dominant in humans
- Root values express themselves progressively from proximal to distal along the limb
- Dermatones are particularly defined either side of the axial lines as these are where dermatomes from distinct spinal segments are placed next to each other due to limb rotation and hence, do not overlap (E.g C4-C8 and T1-T2 in UL and )

![Screenshot 2021-08-28 at 16.23.12.png](%5B001%5D%20MMB%20Organisational%20Patterns%20of%20Limb%205f56db57476a4212bd571af6a34ee50d/Screenshot_2021-08-28_at_16.23.12.png)

# Nerve Plexus

- Plexus = Mixing and Redistribution/reorganisation of Spinal Nerves to form Peripheral Nerves
- This allows fibres from one specific spinal level (From one spinal nerve) to reach multiple different end points by contributing to multiple different peripheral nerves
- This also ensures that all spinal nerves are contained in bundles, which can be protected, allowing multiple nerves to be easily protected
- Limb innervation is organised as Plexi (Brachial in UL and Lumbosacral in LL)
- For Median Nerve, C5 usually ends in the arm, C6 ends at the elbow, C7 ends at the forearm/wrist, C8 ends at the wrist and T1 ends at the fingers (Higher Spinal Levels end more proximal down the limb when multiple spinal levels contribute to a single peripheral nerve)

![Screenshot 2021-08-28 at 20.43.55.png](%5B001%5D%20MMB%20Organisational%20Patterns%20of%20Limb%205f56db57476a4212bd571af6a34ee50d/Screenshot_2021-08-28_at_20.43.55.png)

# Clinical Relevance - Limb Innervation

- Sx from Nerve Lesions (Muscle Paralysis and Loss of Sensation etc.) at the Spinal Nerve Root level follow the Dermatome Distribution pattern as these lesions affect all peripheral nerves with fibres from the affected nerve root
- Sx from Nerve Lesions at the Periphery express themselves differently from root level injuries, depending on the Spinal Nerve Roots involved in the Peripheral Nerve Formation at the point of the lesion
- Nerve Lesions cause Sx in regions that are innervated by segments of the Nerve found distal to the site of Injury

---

# Spinal Root Values and Limb Movements

- As you move distally down the limb, more distal/caudal spinal nerve levels are responsible for innervating muscles that produce movements at that joint
- Shoulder Abduction = C5
- Shoulder Adduction = C6 & C7
- Elbow Flexion = C5 & C6 (C5,C6, pick up sticks)
- Elbow Extension = C6 and C7
- Hand/Wrist Circumduction = C6 and C7
- Finger Extension = C6 and C7
- Finger Flexion = C8
- Finger Abduction and Adduction = T1
- Hip Flexion = L1-L3
- Hip Extension = L4-S1
- Knee Extension = L3 and L4 (L3,L4, Kick the Door)
- Knee Flexion = L5 and S1
- Ankle Extension = L4 and L5
- Ankle Flexion = L5 and S1
- Ankle Inversion = L4 and L5
- Ankle Eversion = L5 and S1

# Clinical Relevance - Surface Anatomy

This has a high clinical relevance for:

1.  The range of movements around joints
2. Identifying pulse sites:
• The femoral pulse is found just below the midinguinal point
3. Finding blood vessels for drug administration or giving intramuscular injections (e.g. into the deltoid or gluteus maximus)
4. Testing neural lesions (e.g. loss of sensation at particular dermatomes)
5. Testing muscle groups e.g. (carrying out reflex tests on tendons)

# Pattern of Lymphatics in the Limb

- The limbs themselves do not contain many lymph nodes. Instead, the limbs have superficial and deep lymphatic vessels
- The most distal part of the limb where lymph nodes are found are the cubital fossa and popliteal fossa - below these regions, no more lymph nodes can be found, only vessels
- The major/main lymph nodes that drain the limbs are found in the axillary area (upper limb) and in the superficial and deep inguinal area (where the thigh and groin come together – lower limb)
- Lymph from both lower limbs and the Left Upper Limb drain towards the Thoracic Duct, which joins the venous system at the Left Venous Angle (Where the Left Subclavian and Jugular Veins meet)
- Right Upper Limb drains to the Right Lymphatic Duct, which joins the venous system at the Right Venous Angle (Where the Right Subclavian and Jugular Veins meet)

![Screenshot 2021-08-28 at 16.26.40.png](%5B001%5D%20MMB%20Organisational%20Patterns%20of%20Limb%205f56db57476a4212bd571af6a34ee50d/Screenshot_2021-08-28_at_16.26.40.png)

# Limb Blood Supply

- All limbs are supplied by a single artery which splits into various branches as it runs distally down the limb
- These arteries follow the path of the bones (Single vessel in Arm/Thigh, Two arteries in the  Leg/Forearm and Multiple arteries in the Hand/Feet)
- In the upper limb, the subclavian artery comes off the aorta on the left and the brachiocephalic artery on the right
- This then becomes the axillary artery and then the brachial artery when it is in the arm
- Around the elbow it splits into the radial and the ulnar artery and then supplies the hand
- In the lower limb the abdominal aorta splits into the common iliac artery which splits into an internal and external iliac artery
- The external iliac artery becomes the femoral artery which supplies the thigh
- Around the knee area, it becomes the Popliteal Artery, which splits into an anterior and posterior tibial artery which supplies the legs and the feet
- The veins follow a similar pattern, following the course of the Arteries until the Common Iliac Vein (From the LL) joins the IVC and the Subclavian Veins drain into the SVC
