# [071] Autoimmunity and Neurological Disorders - Multiple Sclerosis Case Study

# Case Study

- 35-year-old female presented with loss of vision in her left eye.
- She had had attacks of insomnia and had lost weight during last year and felt tired and depressed.
- She had remembered an episode of tingling sensation in her left leg 3 years previously, lasted for some weeks and then disappeared.
- On examination, vital signs were normal.
- Neurological examination revealed partial loss of vision in her left eye, and ophthalmoscopy revealed inflamed optic nerve.
- Both legs were hyper-reflexic with ‚Üë muscle tone

# Laboratory Tests

- Examination of CSF by lumbar puncture showed:
- 7 leukocytes/ml
- Normal protein concentration (0.43 g/l).
- ‚Üë [IgG] (0.12 g/l).
- In this case, presence of a long history relapsing remitting symptoms, evidence for involvement of multiple parts of nervous system, plus CSF and imaging findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of MS

# How does Multiple Sclerosis Present?

- Typically presents in young adults, and usually (85% of patients) follows a relapsing and remitting course with minimal residual disability between episodes of relapse.
- 4 main types: benign, relapsing remitting, secondary progressive and primary progressive.
- Primary progressive: gets worse with time and no treatment.
- Secondary progressive: longer duration without relapse remitting.
- Difficult to predict prognosis of an individual patient.
- Relapsing remitting MS eventually develops into secondary progressive MS
(remissions no longer occur).
- 10% of patients have primary progressive MS (no remissions).
- In benign MS, patients suffer relatively small number of episodes of demyelination and have minimal disability after 10-15 years.

# Signs and Symptoms

- A variety of these may occur depending on anatomical location of plaques.

### Visual Sx

- Optical neuritis (pain, blurred vision, impaired acuity, impaired colour vision, visual field defect, afferent papillary deficit).
- Diplopia (double vision) resulting from brainstem plaque.

### Sensorimotor Disturbance

- Spastic paraparesis (weakness of lower extremities).
- Pain in some patients (limbs or trigeminal distribution).

### Other Sx and Signs

- ‚Üë incidence of epilepsy.
- Bladder disturbance.
- Erectile dysfunction.
- Lhermitte phenomenon (tingling shooting into limbs on neck flexion).
- Symptoms may be worse after a hot bath.

# Key Clinical Features and Laboratory Tests That Aid Dx

### Clinical Features

- Central to diagnosis.
- Distribution of lesions in time and space are characteristic of disease.
- Diagnosis requires occurrence of at least 2 lesions in CNS, separated in time and space.
- Signs and symptoms: optic atrophy, cerebellar dysarthia, ataxia, urinary symptoms, spastic paraparesis, dementia, mood disturbance.

### Laboratory Tests

- MRI of brain/spinal cord (plaques).
- MRI scans of brain of a 25-year-old female with relapsingremitting multiple sclerosis.

- Visual evoked potential: delayed central conduction in visual pathways.
- Healthy eye has many large deflections.
- Damaged eye with damaged optic nerve has fewer high amplitude deflections, as impulse can no longer be transmitted.

- CSF examination: findings are non-specific:
1. ‚Üë lymphocytes in active phase.
2. ‚Üë protein
3. Oligoclonal bands on electrophoresis (local Ig synthesis).
    - Test CSF and serum for antibodies. CSF shouldn‚Äôt have antibodies.
    - Finding banding in CSF suggests antibodies are produced in within CNS, because they shouldn‚Äôt pass BBB.

    - Any of these tests can produce false +ves or false -ves.
    - Histological assessment: only occasionally necessary, usually in patients with atypical presentations.
    - Studies comparing clinical, radiological and post-mortem neuropathological features of MS are continuing to provide insights into this disease.

# Pathogenesis

- Severe demyelination prevents conduction of nerve impulses through myelinated axons, partial myelin injury results in delayed conduction, inability to transmit fast trains of impulses.
- Autoimmune response: damage caused by inflammatory cells (T cells and macrophages) - Circumstantial evidence.
- Role of infectious agents: circumstantial evidence.
- Induction of autoimmunity through molecular mimicry: circumstantial evidence.
- Evidence for T cell responses against myelin antigens (e.g. myelin basic protein) but this is also seen in healthy people.
- Pathogenesis probably mediated mainly by T cells and macrophages/DC but with possible contributions form antibodies
(B cells).

### Infectious Agents

- Many infectious environmental have been tested, but none specifically identified as pathogenic.
- However, 40% of new clinical events are associated with recent viral infection, particularly upper respiratory tract infections.
- Worldwide, MS occurs with much greater frequency in higher latitudes (between 40¬∞ and 60¬∞ north and south latitude).
- British troops occupied Faroese in large numbers from 1940-1945.
- All but 3 patients resided in locations where troops were stationed, and those 3 also had direct contact with British.
- Concluded that there is evidence of MS on Faroes and that disease was probably introduced by British troops. If so, then MS on Faroese is a transmissible disease, most likely infectious

### Molecular Mimicry - Potentially with Myelin Basic Protein

- Epstein Barr virus
- Human herpes virus 6
- Herpes simplex virus
- Measles virus
- Human coronavirus 229E

# Treatments

## Modify the Immune Response

### Corticosteroids

- Anti-inflammatory.
- Can be used to ‚Üì time to recovery following relapses but do not affect degree of recovery.
- Regular steroids may slow disease progression in relapsing remitting MS.

### ùú∑-interferon

- This is of benefit to some patient (but not curative).
- Probably functions through suppression of TNF production.

### Copaxone (Glatiramer Acetate)

- Induces Th2 (IL-10)/Th3 (TGFt3) cells that migrate to brain and downregulate activation of pathogenic Th1 cells.
- Inhibitory effects on DCs and monocytes.
- ‚Üë proliferation, differentiation and survival of oligodendrocytes progenitor cells.

### Tysabri (Natalizimab)

- Monoclonal Ab to integrin molecules on T cells (VLA-4) preventing them crossing BBB.
- Humanised anti-a4 integrin monoclonal antibody.
- Used in treatment of MS and Crohn‚Äôs disease.
- Given once a month as intravenous drip over a 1- hour period in a hospital or clinic setting.
- Observation for 1 hour is required following infusion
- At phase II clinical trials, 72% of patients had no relapses at end of a 2-year study compared with 46% of people taking placebo.
- Based on phase III clinical trial in US, was approved in 2004 for treatment of relapsing remitting MS.
- Subsequently withdrawn after being linked with 3 cases of rare neurological condition, progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (PML) when administered in combination with f3-interferon.
- Risk of developing PML was estimated to be 1:1,000.
- After a review and no further deaths, returned to market in 2006.
- Only for patients with severe evolving forms of relapsing remitting MS.
- No longer used in combination with f3 interferon.
- All patients registered and monitored.

### Ocrelizumab

- Molecular target is CD20 molecule on B cells (immunosuppressive).
- 2 phase III trials (OPERA I and OPERA II) have shown that ocrelizumab ‚Üì annual relapse rates by around 46% compared with ùõΩ-interferon after 2 years.
- Treatment also ‚Üì progression of clinical disability by 40.
- In March 2017, approved by US FDA as a treatment for both relapsing and primary progressive MS.

### Alemtuzumab

- Humanised CAMPATH
- Binds CD52, present on all
mature lymphocytes (immunsupressive).
- Phase III clinical trial: 334 previously untreated patients with early relapsing-remitting MS.
- Relapse rate ‚Üì by 74% and sustained accumulation of disability ‚Üì 71%, both compared to ùõΩ-interferon.
- Benefit last at least 3 years.

## Relieving Sx (Improve Quality of Life)

- Baclofen and diazepam: ‚Üì spasticity.
- Anticholinergic drugs: treat bladder symptoms.
- Cannabis derivatives such as sativex (cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol) symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain
