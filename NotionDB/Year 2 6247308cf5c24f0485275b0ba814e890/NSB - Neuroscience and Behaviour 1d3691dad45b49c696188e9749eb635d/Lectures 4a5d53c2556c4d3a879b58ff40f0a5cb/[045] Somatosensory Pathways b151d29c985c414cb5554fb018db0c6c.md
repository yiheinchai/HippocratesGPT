# [045] Somatosensory Pathways

- [ ]  Add the tests for the syndromes

# Spinal Cord Roots

- Roots enter/exit at each vertebra and map sensory regions on the body surface (dermatomes).
- Dermatomes for touch and nociception are similar but do not have the exact same boundaries due to the different RFs for the receptors involved in these sensations
- Dermatome boundaries are sharper for pain compared to light discriminative touch.
- When a person is touching their toes (as is seen in most quadrupeds on 'all fours'), Dermatomes are more vertically orientated and show a more defined segmental organisation, following that segmental organisation of the spinal cord (There are clear boundaries between each spinal region)

# Varicella Zoster Virus

- After chickenpox infections, VZV lies dormant in primary sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia.
- In some cases, virus reactivation  in later life causes severe burning pain (inflammation in nerve fibres, in dorsal root initially, causing skin blisters where cutaneous somatosensory receptors end as the).
- Virus travels down afferent axons and causes blistering of skin (shingles).
- Often, effects are restricted to a single dorsal root and so lesion defines a single dermatome.

# Laminar Organisation of Afferent Terminals in Spinal Cord

- Laminae of Rexed: vertical lamination of dorsal and ventral horns of grey matter.
- Different afferent types carrying different modes of sensation terminate in different Laminae of Rexed
- II: substantia gelatinosa.
- III and IV: sensory neurons.
- V-VIII: interneurons.
- IX: motor neurons.
- X: region around central canal.

# Major Ascending Spinal Sensory Pathways to the Brain

1. Dorsal columns
2. Spinothalamic tract
3. Spinocerebellar tract

---

# Dorsal Columns (Medial Lemniscal Pathway)

- This is a Direct pathway that does not decussate in the spinal cord.
- It conveys discriminative touch (light touch) and proprioception information via Aβ (Type II) and Aα (1a and 1b) Afferents.
- These inputs come through dorsal roots and branch, with some terminating on Spinal Interneurons whilst others send collaterals to ascend the spinal cord within the Dorsal Column.
- **Gracile Column/Fasciculus Gracilis**: Conveys information from the Lower Half of the Body and the trunk.
- **Cuneate Column/Fasciculus Cuneatus**: Conveys information from the upper part of body and upper limbs.
- Fibres of the Dorsal Column Pathway always run up in the Most Lateral Column present at the specific spinal level
- No synapsing, all 1 neuron as it travels up the Dorsal Column.

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.27.41.png](%5B045%5D%20Somatosensory%20Pathways%20b151d29c985c414cb5554fb018db0c6c/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.27.41.png)

- Primary Afferent travelling up dorsal column ends at dorsal column nuclei within the Medulla.
- Neurons from the Lower Body and Trunk travelling in the Fasciculus Gracilis end in the Nucleus Gracilis whilst Neurons from the Upper Limbs travelling in the Fasciculus Cuneatus end in the Nucleus Cuneatus
- Second order Dorsal Column neurons have their cell bodies in the Dorsal Nuclei and  project ventrally, and decussate to enter the Contralateral medial lemniscus, in which it ascends to end in the Ventral Posterolateral Nucleus
- A Third Order Thalamic Neurons then projects from the VPL to S1
- This pathway decussates at the level of the Closed Medulla

# Trigeminal Touch Pathway

- This is the equivalent of the Dorsal Column Pathway but for the face
- Somatosensory information for face is conveyed through CN V.
- This information is conveyed down CN V Afferents to to principal/Chief Sensory nucleus of CN V in the Caudal Pons
- Second order projection from Chief Sensory Nucleus, decussating here and joins the Contralateral Medial Lemniscus to ascend towards the Contralateral Thalamus, Ending on the VPM (not VPL like the other neurons from the body)
- Third Order Thalamic Neurons project from the VPM to the S1 (Inferior Aspect of the Lateral S1/Face Region)
- This pathway decussates at the level of the Caudal Pons

# Spinothalamic Tract

- Indirect Pathway that decussates in spinal cord
- It conveys nociceptive information (pain and temperature) via C and Aδ Fibres.
- Some axons can travel up locally in Lissauer's Tract (Found just Lateral to the Dorsal Columns at the tip of the Dorsal Horn) but many terminate in substantia gelatinosa (Lamina II of the Spinal Grey) to synapse on a Second Order Spinothalamic Neuron
- Second order Spinothalamic Neuron projects anteriorly down the Dorsal Horn and decussates to enter the Contralateral spinothalamic tract which ascends through the medulla to end in the Contralateral Ventral Posterior Nucleus of the Thalamus
- Third Order Thalamic Neurons then project from the VPN to S1
- It decussates at segmental level that input comes in (just ventral to central canal).

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.32.41.png](%5B045%5D%20Somatosensory%20Pathways%20b151d29c985c414cb5554fb018db0c6c/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.32.41.png)

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.32.52.png](%5B045%5D%20Somatosensory%20Pathways%20b151d29c985c414cb5554fb018db0c6c/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.32.52.png)

- The Dorsal Column and Spinothalamic Pathways ascend the Spinal Cord and converge to Unite at the level of the Midbrain-Thalamus as they both project to the VPN
- The Dorsal Column and Spinothalamic Tracts are found on opposite sides of the Spinal Cord as the Spinothalamic Tract decussates in the Spinal Cord (found on the Contralateral Spinal Cord) whereas the Dorsal Column Neurons do not (Found on the Ipsilateral Spinal Cord)
- This means that Dorsal Column and Spinothalamic Neurons from a specific region of the body are closely associated to one another in the Thalamus and S1 (These is convergence of these neurons as they approach S1) and allowing Nociceptive, Discriminative Touch and Proprioceptive Information from the Same body region to reach the same region of S1, producing Dermatomes

# Spinocerebellar Tract

- This is an Indirect pathway
- It conveys mainly proprioception information
- Leg and lower trunk muscle spindle afferents ascend in the Fasiculus Gracilis initially, before exiting at thoracic levels to synapse with neurons of nucleus dorsalis (Clarke’s column, Found in the Deep Dorsal Horn between the Levels T1-L3).
- Axons from Clarke’s columns form dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSCT), ending in cerebellum ipsilaterally.
- There are other spinocerebellar tracts:
1. Ventral spinocerebellar tract (VSCT) conveys Golgi tendon organ information to the Cerebellum.
2. Cuneocerebellar tract is upper body equivalent of DSCT, supplying proprioceptive information from the Upper Body to the Cerebellum.

# Syndromes

### Dorsal Column (Deficits in Touch and Proprioception)

**Tabes Dorsalis**

- Most common form of neurosyphilis (consequence of untreated syphilis).
- It produces typical stamping gait due to no proprioceptive feedback from lower limb and trunk muscles during locomotion, producing inaccurate movements during walking.

**Friedreich's Ataxia**

- Genetic degenerative disease of dorsal columns and spinocerebellar tracts.

**Brown-Sequard Syndrome**

- Spinal cord hemisection to either the LHS or RHS.
- Typical cause is medially directed stab producing hemisection of spinal cord.
- Will cut ascending tracts on that side (spinothalamic and dorsal columns) and descending motor tracts.
- There is the Loss of Touch and Proprioception on the Ipsilateral Body below the Lesion (Lower Limb usually) as the Dorsal Column Neurons have not yet decussated
- There is the Loss of Pain and Temperature on the Contralateral Body below the Lesion as the Spinothalamic Tracts have already decussated below lesion (as Spinothalamic Neurons decussate at the Segmental Level at which they enter the Spinal Cord)
- There is complete loss of sensation over the Ipsilateral Dermatome that corresponds to the level of the Lesion due to damage to the Dorsal Roots

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.37.48.png](%5B045%5D%20Somatosensory%20Pathways%20b151d29c985c414cb5554fb018db0c6c/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.37.48.png)

### Spinothalamic Syndromes (Deficits in Pain and Temperature Sense)

**Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome**

- Often due to atherosclerosis or spinal injury.
- Anterior spinal artery supplies anterior part of spinal cord, containing the Spinothalamic Tract but not the Dorsal Column.
- It supplies spinothalamic tract as it is ventral to central canal.
- Results in the loss of pain and temperature but not touch sensation

**Syringomyelia**

- Caused by occlusion/damage to decussating pathways in the spinal cord due to degenerative
expansion of spinal central canal, eroding surrounding tissue.
- The Second Order Spinothalamic Neurons are particular damaged as they cross just ventral to the Central Canal and hence, are compressed significantly in Syringomyelia

# Primary Somatosensory Cortex

- This contains a Topographic map of contralateral body surface in postcentral gyrus.
- The Topographic Map seen in M1 and S1 are very similar in their arrangement, with Motor and Sensory Areas of Specific Body regions in M1 and S1 respectively often being found adjacent to one another
- This map is commonly described via the Sensory homunculus.

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.40.13.png](%5B045%5D%20Somatosensory%20Pathways%20b151d29c985c414cb5554fb018db0c6c/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.40.13.png)

# Thalamic Connections of Sensory and Association Cortices

- The Somatosensory Tracts project predominantly to the Ventrobasal Complex of the Thalamus, most significantly the Ventral Posterolateral Nucleus
- The Ventral Lateral Nucleus (Main Input of Motor Pathways) is found just Anterior to the Ventral Posterior Nucleus (Main Input of Sensory Pathways), allowing these Nuclei to project to similar cortical regions
- VPL Receives somatosensation from the Limbs and Trunks and VPM Receives somatosensation from the Head and the Neck

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.41.01.png](%5B045%5D%20Somatosensory%20Pathways%20b151d29c985c414cb5554fb018db0c6c/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.41.01.png)

# Subdivisions of Postcentral Gyrus

- From Anterior to Posterior, there are 4 Brodmann Areas within the Postcentral Gyrus/S1 which are 3a → 3b → 1 → 2
- In 3b of S1, there are large areas for Somatosensation from the Hands and the Feet to provide high sensitivity to these areas, with the corresponding Hand and Feet areas of Area 1 in S1 being smaller than that in 3b (but have a similar organisation) → This means that somatosensation from a particular body region activates slightly different areas of Area 1 and Area 3b within S1 which are found close to one another

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.41.16.png](%5B045%5D%20Somatosensory%20Pathways%20b151d29c985c414cb5554fb018db0c6c/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.41.16.png)

### Neuronal Architecture in S1

- As it is Neocortex, it is similar to other cortical regions in its structure, containing 6 layers (I-VI moving Deep)
- M1 Lacks Layer IV Neurons
- Layer V is the Output Layer of S1 via Pyramidal Neurons that have dendrites extending superficially to Level I, along where many Afferent Fibres synapse
- The Axon of Pyramidal Neurons from Layer V Project deep to leave the Cortex and travel to other regions of the brain
- Input layers in layer 3 and mainly layer 4.
- S1 is heavily/tightly organised vertically as neuronal columns with some minor lateral connections between these columns

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.41.53.png](%5B045%5D%20Somatosensory%20Pathways%20b151d29c985c414cb5554fb018db0c6c/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.41.53.png)

### Brodmann Areas 3b to 5 - 4 Separate Maps of the Body Surface in S1

- When looking at the RFs associated with the different S1 Neurons, it appears that the RFs increase in size and complexity as you move posteriorly across S1 from 3b to 5
- The Smallest RFs are found in Area 3b (E.g Finger Tip), detecting small details on an object
- Area 1 has cells which respond to touch in any 4 digits, detecting large objects.
- This large input means that area 1 must have multiple inputs (from multiple cells).
- Area 2 has neurons that have a RF that spans the entire length of the Finger and the region of the Palm where the Finger extends from the palm
- Area 5 detects both hands (involves neurons bilaterally, with some fibres passing through the Corpus Callosum to reach the Contralateral S1 alongside Contralateral Non-Decussated Fibres.)
- The RFs from 3b Neurons are combined together to form the Larger and More Complex RFs seen in Area 1 and 2
- This range of RFs across these various regions of S1 allows for Feature Extraction, where different properties (E.g Size) of an object can be identified by different regions of S1 due to their varying RFs Sizes (Smaller RFs identify Smaller Objects and Larger RFs identify Larger Objects)

Venn diagrams to determine which area is touched

### Complex Receptive Fields in Macaque Monkey Area 2

- Brodmann Area 2 here contains Orientation selective Neurons corresponding to RFs on the Palmar Surface of the Hand that fire when a stimulus is in a specific orientation only (E.g pressing horizontally causes high levels of activity whilst pressing vertically/oblique causes low levels of activity.
- This allows for the orientation of objects (E.g Bars) to be determined by S1
- These neurons are mostly horizontally selective as they are most useful in the organisation of grip and object manipulation within the hand
- This area also contains Direction Selective Neurons on the Dorsum of the Hand that will only fire when an object is moved in a specific direction across the hand but not in the other direction
- This directional sensitivity is formed by the Output of Various Small RF Neurons that are organised along a specific direction/path, with there being undirectional inhibitory projections of Cortical Neuron found between the Small RF Neurons at each end of the chain that report position
- This provides directional sensitivity as in one direction the first Neuron stimulated will inhibit the other cortical neurons found in the direction of the movement, preventing the Neurons here from firing
- However, when moving in the opposite direction, the Neurons found along this path have not been previously inhibited (due to the Undirectional Inhibition), allowing these Cortical Neurons to fire APs when the specific directional movement is produced

### Microdomains of Area 3b

- S1 is distinguished from other Cortical Areas due to its columnar organisation of neurons
- The Area 3b digit map is organised into Microdomains, with there being different columns receiving afferents from different classes of skin receptors, notably based on whether they are Rapid or Slow Adapting (e.g. Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles).
- This allows for separate processing of information from different receptors until they are combined when they are fed into/used by Higher Level Areas of S1 (E.g RF Generation)

# Phantom Limb

### Phantom Limb

- After losing part of limb, it is not uncommon for patients to report somatosensation or even pain from parts/the entirety limb that has been lost.

### Referred Phantom Limbs

- This is where touching the skin of specific regions can feel like an amputated body part is being touched/stimulated (E.g Touching Upper Arm and Lateral Face feels like fingers are being touched)
- Can be somatosensation or pain.

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.46.09.png](%5B045%5D%20Somatosensory%20Pathways%20b151d29c985c414cb5554fb018db0c6c/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.46.09.png)

### Cause of Phantom Limbs/Referred Phantom Limb

- Somatotropic Organisation of S1 means stimulation of a specific region of S1 produces the feeling of sensation over a specific body part
- In Amputees, there is no somatosensory input to the region of S1 that is associated with the amputated body part however, the region of S1 associated with this amputated region is still functional (it has only lost input)
- Referred Phantom Limbs could be caused by collaterals arising from Third Order Thalamic Neurons from non-amputated body parts which end in the Region of S1 associated with the Amputated Body Part
- This is because in Phantom Limb, there is still activity of the S1 region corresponding to the Amputated Limb (E.g for the Hand, this could be from the Shoulder or Face Region found either side)
- Phantom Limbs could also be that the Cut Stumps of the Afferents supplying S1 become irritated and therefore, continue to fire and stimulate the S1 Territory associated with the Amputated Body part or due to spontaneous activation of the S1 Territory of the Amputated body part
- This means that Sensation, as generated within S1 from Somatosensory Information from the Periphery, seems to be a competitive system as when one region of S1 becomes inactive due to lack of input, other afferent inputs may innervate this region of S1 to restore its activity (producing the Phantom Sensations)

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.46.20.png](%5B045%5D%20Somatosensory%20Pathways%20b151d29c985c414cb5554fb018db0c6c/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.46.20.png)

# Referred Pain

- Viscera contain Silent Somatosensory Receptors whose high Activation Threshold means they are not usually active and hence, do not occupy any S1 Territory (Usually only active in inflammation)
- Pain from visceral Nociceptors is usually interpreted as somatic and relates to myotome from which they develop embryologically.
- This means that Visceral Afferents provide input into S1 Regions, producing Sensation over the Region of the Body that corresponds to that S1 region and develops from the same Myotome as the Viscera
- Since viscera migrate considerable distances from their embryonic origin, referred pain in the S1 Region associated with its Somatic Projection can be found quite distant from its real visceral source.

| Somatic Projection | Visceral Organ |
| --- | --- |
| C3-C4 (Scapular Area/Shoulder Blades) | Diaphragm |
| T1-T8 | Heart |
| T10 | Appendix |
| T10-T12 | Testes and Prostate |
| T10-T12 | Ovaries and Uterus |
