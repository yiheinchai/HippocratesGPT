# [069] Neuropathology

# Role of Neuropathologists

### Neurohistopathology

- Interface between clinical departments and life sciences.
- Specimen arrives from neurosurgical team and is prepared for tissue processing.
- Specimen is processed overnight to make it permanent.
- A machine removes water and replaces it with paraffin wax, creating wax blocks ready for cutting.
- Specimen is then sectioned with precision microtomes.
- Sections are 4 𝜇m.
- Then stained with highly specialised fully automated instruments.

### Staining and Molecular Pathology

- Since 1900s: tinctorial stains.
- Since 1980s: immunohistochemical stains.
- Since 2004: routine molecular analysis of all brain tumours at Queen Square.
- Since 2016: Methylation profiling of brain tumours

# Structure of the Normal Brain

### Grey Matter

- Consists of dense synaptic networks.
- White matter structures are devoid of such synaptic networks.
- Synaptophysin stain: stain for synaptophysin protein found in synapses.
- Stains grey matter as opposed to white matter as dense synaptic networks, where Synaptophysin is found, are not present in the white matter

### White Matter

- Corpus callosum, commissures, capsule interna, brain stem.
- Oligodendrocytes produce white matter myelin, and forms a sheath around axons.
- Astrocytes and microglia are also present in white matter.
- Luxol-fast blue stain: used to stain myelin under light microscopy.
- White Matter can also be visualised using Myelin Basic Protein Stains to visualise Myelinated Axons in white matter

# Reaction of Glial Cells to Cerebral Injury

- Glial cells are meant to form scars to tissue damage.

| Type | Description | Pathogenesis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gliosis/Astrogliosis | Proliferation and reactive changes of astrocytes | Non-specific reaction of brain to almost all tissue damaged:
tumour, infarction, chronic neuronal loss

Microglia (contain thin, branching processes with little cytoplasm) Precursor of macrophages in brain (Appear Larger and more spherical) | Like astrogliosis, a nonspecific reaction to all injury of brain: inflammation, tumour, hypoxia, trauma, neurodegeneration,
demyelination. |
| Macrophages | Originate from
blood monocytes and from microglia cells of brain | Non-specific mechanism for clearing necrotic brain tissue. Infarction, trauma,
demyelination |

# Demyelination and Overview of Cellular Changes in Neurodegenerative Disease Progression

### Demyelination (E.g Multiple Sclerosis)

- T cells against oligodendrocyte myelin, leading to demyelination and a block of signal transduction.
- This is commonly seen by the Presence of Lots of Macrophages within White Matter, alongside Axons (Stained by Silver Stain)
- Macrophages then aid the degredation and transportation of Myelin away from the Neuron via Phagocytosis
- The Break down of myelin causes lipids to be left behind (commonly identified via Sudan Stain)

# Alzheimer’s Disease

### Hallmarks

- Global Cerebral atrophy: loss of neurons and Gyri and expansion of ventricular volume and Sulci due to loss of brain tissue - Macroscopic Hallmark
- Amyloid plaques: extracellular protein deposition. Aggregate of abnormal 𝛽-sheeted protein.
- Neurofibrillary tangles: intracellular fibrillary protein deposition. 𝜏 protein.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 19.42.11.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_19.42.11.png)

### Amyloid Plaques in Alzheimer’s Brains

- Amyloid plaques found in cortex (less so in the Subcortical Matter) and blood vessels.
- These can be found as diffuse plaques and more intensely staining Core/Neuritic Plaques via the formation of Dystrophic Neurites due to Tauopathy
- These Core Plaques have a dense core of Amyloid and more diffuse layer of Amyloid surrounding it
- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: Amyloid plaques found in blood vessels.
- Destabilise integrity of vessel wall, making it susceptible to breaking and bleeding.
- Not all people with Alzheimer’s have amyloid angiopathy.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 19.43.00.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_19.43.00.png)

### Mechanism of Amyloid Formation

- Amyloid protein precursor (APP) is normal protein, which is a signalling protein.
- C-terminus is intracellular and N terminus is extracellular.
- APP can be cleaved at 3 potential sites by 𝜶,𝜷 and 𝜸 secretases
- 𝜸 secretase cleaves APP at a transmembrane cleavage site where APP is adherent to the cell membrane to free it from the Cell Membrane
- 𝜶 secretase cleaves at an extracellular site between the Transmembrane and 𝜷 secretase cleaving site, forming a normal cleavage product which decreases Ca²⁺ influx and hence, is neuroprotective and involved in neural plasticity
- 𝜷 secretase cleaves at position 40 or 42 of APP from the transmembrane site
- 𝜶,𝜷 and 𝜸 secretases normally have their activity regulated but if there is hyperactivity 𝛽 or 𝛾 secretases, smaller fragments of amyloid are produced that are 42 amino acids longer.
- This 42AA Peptide is a 𝛽 peptide that tends to form 𝛽-sheets, which aggregate together to form protofibrils which are thought to cause excessive Ca²⁺ influx which is neurotoxic.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 19.44.16.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_19.44.16.png)

### Neurofibrillary Tangles in Alzheimer’s Disease

- First start in hippocampus, then entorhinal cortex, then limbic system, then cortex etc.
- These are comprised of hyperphosphorylated 𝜏 which occupy large regions of the Neuronal Cytoplasm.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 19.44.55.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_19.44.55.png)

### Staging of Neurofibrillary Tangle Pathology (Braak)

- In Braak Stages I-II, Tau Pathology is mild localised to the Hippocampus (Transentorhinal)
- In Braak Stages III-IV, Tau Pathology progresses in the Hippocampus to become Moderate and spreads to wider areas of the Limbic Cortex to cause Mild Tau Pathology here
- In Braak Stages V-VI (Very Severe Alzheimer’s), There is Very Severe Tau Pathology in the Medial Temporal Lobe and Spread of Tau Pathology to the Frontal Cortex, moving posteriorly to last affect the Occipital Cortex

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 19.45.24.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_19.45.24.png)

### Taupathies - Mechanisms

- Normally, 𝜏 proteins (Microtubule Associated Protein) links microtubules to maintain the integrity of the Cytoskeleton.
- Hyperphosphorylated 𝜏 causes aggregation of Microtubules to form Paired Helical Filaments (mainly) or Straight Filaments, which has a reduced ability to link together Microtubules.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 19.46.01.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_19.46.01.png)

# Protein Aggregation and Neurodegeneration and Human Transmission of Amyloid 𝛽.

### Protein Aggregation and Neurodegeneration

- Protein Aggregation is the Pathological Basis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases
- The same protein can be involved in Multiple different pathologies depending on the localisation of the Pathology

| Disease | Protein Aggregates |
| --- | --- |
| Alzheimer’s Disease | 𝛽-A4, Hyperphosphorylated 𝜏 |
| Pick’s disease | 𝜏 |
| Corticobasal Degeneration | 𝜏 |
| Progressive Supranuclear Palsy | 𝜏 |
| Frontotemporal Dementia with Parkinsonism Linked to Chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) | 𝜏 |
| Parkinson’s Disease | 𝛼-Synuclein - Forms Lewy Bodies |
| Lewy-Body Disease | 𝛼-Synuclein - Forms Lewy Bodies |
| Multisystem Atrophy | 𝛼-Synuclein - Forms Lewy Bodies |
| Huntington’s Disease | Huntingtin - Found in small, dot-like inclusions |
| Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease | Prion protein |
| Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Syndrome (Inherited Syndrome) | Prion protein |
|  |  |

### Human Transmission of Amyloid 𝛽 via Medical Procedures (Iatrogenically)

- More than 200 cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) have resulted from treatment, with human cadaveric pituitary-derived growth hormone contaminated with prions.
- In UK: 1,848 patients received c-hGH from 1959 through 1958, and 38 had developed CJD by year 2000.
- Peak incubation period of 20 years.
- Subsequent patients monitored.
- Autopsy 8 iCJD (iatrogenic CJD) patients (36-51 y/o), compared to 19 controls with other forms of CJD.
- As well as Prion Transmission from the Contaminated GH Sample, there was Moderate to severe grey matter and vascular amyloid 𝛽 (A𝛽) pathology (E.g Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy) in 4 Px.
- Pituitary gland may have had traces of A𝛽 (Found in some elderly Px) which when multiple different Pituitary Gland samples were pooled together to source sufficient Growth Hormone for supplementation, led to the accumulation of Amyloid 𝛽
- This Accumulated Amyloid 𝛽 had been transferred to individuals iatrogenically alongside the Growth Hormone derived from the Infected Pituitary Glands.

# Effects of Space Occupying Intracerebral Lesions

### Causes of Raised Intracranial Pressure

1. Brain Oedema
- There are 3 Types, Acute Brain Swelling (Trauma, causing loss of autoregulation), Vasogenic Oedema (Disruption in the BBB, potentially at Tumour Margins) and Cytotoxic Oedema (Hypoxia and Ischaemia)
- Hydrocephalus - Extravasation of CSF

### Relationship Between ICP and Volume

- When there is an initial increase in Intracranial Volume, there is a small increase in ICP due to the compressability of Sulci and Ventricles
- At higher values of ICV (when there has been significant compression of Sulci and Ventricles), small increases in ICV produce large changes in ICP (Increase in ICP with ICV shows an Exponential Relationship), which can lead to acute herniations
- This leads to an increased vulnerability to further increases in volume (blood, CSF, water).

# Forms of Brain Oedema

|  | Vasogenic Oedema | Cytotoxic Oedema | Interstitial Oedema |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pathogenesis | BBB | Damage of Cells (Glial and Neurons) | Hydrocephalus |
| Capillary Permeability | Increased | Normal | Normal |
| Localisation | White Matter, Interstitial | Grey and White Matter | Periventricular White Matter |
| Oedema Fluid | Plasma-Filtrate Including Proteins that is extravasated through the BBB | Intracellular H₂O and Na⁺ (These cause cells to swell) | CSF |
| Causes | Tumour, Trauma, Haemorrhage, Infarction, Abscess, Lead Intoxication | Ischaemia (Acute) - Most common, Hyponatraemia, Reye’s Syndrome, Purulent Meningitis | CSF Drainage Obstruction |

# Blood Brain Barrier

- Astrocyte foot processes control outflow of ions. Feet Processes form BBB.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 19.57.29.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_19.57.29.png)

- In Cytotoxic Oedema, the Astrocyte End Feet that form the BBB take up fluid from the Circulation, causing the Astrocytes and Nerves found adjacent (forming synapses) to swell

### Disruption of Blood Brain Barrier in Vasogenic Oedema

- Cerebral metastasis.
- Liver metastases → jaundice
- This causes perifocal extravasation of bilirubin
- In Vasogenic Oedema, damage to the BBB increases its permeability, causing increased fluid extravasation from the circulation into the Interstitium (mainly along tracts within white matter formed between neighbouring axons)

---

# Intracranial Space Occupying Lesions

### Internal Herniations

- Intracranial Space Occupying Lesions like Haemorrhages, Tumours or Abscesses cause a Mass Shift down pressure gradients that pushes the Brain across pre-existing Boundaries/Divisions in the Brain such as the Falx Cerebri, Tentorium Cerebelli or down the Foramen Magnum
- This can give rise to a Falxial Herniation laterally across the Falx Cerebri, Transtentorial Herniation inferorly across the Tentorium Cerebelli or a Cerebellar Tonsil Herniation down the Foramen Magnum
- In a Transtentorial Herniation, the Uncus of the Hippocampus can herniate inferiorly (Downwards Thrust) over the Tentorium Cerebelli to cause occlusion of posterior cerebral artery (Producing Occipital Lobe Infarcts/PCA Stroke) and dilation of ipsilateral pupil via compression of CN III.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 19.58.36.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_19.58.36.png)

### Extradural Haematoma

- Due to Trauma, leading to the Rupture of the Middle Meningeal Artery
- It forms a Convex bleed that is rapid in onset and hence, often deadly (It tends to produce a Midline Shift of the Brain and hence, Herniation)

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 20.00.14.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_20.00.14.png)

### Acute Subdural Haematoma

- Due to Trauma, leading to the rupture of Bridging Veins (Can be Chronic too)
- This is often seen in Elderly Px

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 20.00.24.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_20.00.24.png)

### Subarachnoidal

- Due to rupture of Saccular Aneurysms (Berry Aneurysms etc.)

### Intracerebral Haemorrhage

- Due to Hypertension or Amyloid Angiopathy mainly but also by Angioma and other Metastases

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 20.00.36.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_20.00.36.png)

### Hypertensive Haemorrhage

- Most Commonly caused by Rupturing of the Lenticulostriatal Arteries that supply the Basal Ganglia and Internal Capsule due to Chronic Hypertension
- This commonly causes Haemorrhagic Strokes in the Thalamic or Striatal Area

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 20.00.51.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_20.00.51.png)

### Pathology and Natural History of Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy

- 2nd Most Common Cause of Hypertensive Haemorrhage
- Amyloid deposits within the Endothelium of the Vessel, making it brittle and hence, susceptible to Haemorrhage
- This does not tend to cause Thalamic Haemorrhages but more Peripheral Bleeds, usually Parietal or Occipital

![Screenshot 2022-01-12 at 01.10.43.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-12_at_01.10.43.png)

# Introduction to Cerebral Tumours

### Glioma and Meningioma

- Intrinsic Tumours are usually derived from Astrocytes (Astroctoma/Glioma)  within the Grey and White Matter with Diffuse Infiltrative Growth Patterns
- Extrinsic Tumours such as Meningiomas (From Arachnoid Mater) Compresses the Brain via Expansive Growth (causing Gliosis) but does not infiltrate the Brain Matter itself

![Screenshot 2022-01-12 at 01.19.00.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-12_at_01.19.00.png)

### Pathogenesis of Intrinsic Tumours

- The combination of mutations determine the tumour type
- Normal Cell of Origin acquires a single driver mutation
- Subsequent mutations determine the tumour phenotype
- E.g Loss of ATX with a p53 Mutation → Astrocytoma and Oligodendroglioma  has a IDH Mutation and a IP90Q codeletion
- This allows tumours to be classes based on specific mutations, where the acquisition of additional specific mutations further specialises the tumour

![Screenshot 2022-01-12 at 01.26.52.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-12_at_01.26.52.png)

### IDH1 and IDH2 Metabolic Pathways

- Human gliomas with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations contain ↑ 2HG levels as the mutation in IDH causes it to convert α-Ketoglutarate into 2-Hydroxyglutarate (Oncometabolite) instead of converting Isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate.
- Isocitrate Dehydrogenase normally converts Isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate
- 2-HG Levels accumulate within cells, altering Histone Structures, causing Hypermethylation of the Genome,

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 20.03.45.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_20.03.45.png)

### Diffuse Astrocytoma

- They are often hard to treat surgically due to their diffuse growth
- They are benign tumours histologically with slow growth and a homogenous appearance
- It can be diagnosed histologically using an Immunohistochemical Stain that is specific to its characteristic IDH Mutation
- Loss of ATX is also characteristic of Diffuse Astrocytoma, which can be determined by a lack of Immunohistochemical staining against ATX

![Screenshot 2022-01-12 at 01.31.16.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-12_at_01.31.16.png)

### Oligodendroglioma

- These can be diagnosed via Immunohistochemical Staining indicating the presence of an IDH Mutation and no loss of ATX

![Screenshot 2022-01-12 at 01.32.21.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-12_at_01.32.21.png)

### Glioblastoma

- Most common malignant brain tumour
- Macroscopically, it appears to be non-uniform in appearance (Different regions of different colours)
- Histologically, it has features of High Grade Tumours, Microvascular Proliferation and Necrosis
- These can be identified via Immunohistochemistry as they are IDH Wild Type, EGFR Amplification and sometimes, a TERT Promotor Mutation
- They often contain a Chromosome 7 Gain and Chromosome 10 loss

![Screenshot 2022-01-12 at 01.32.31.png](%5B069%5D%20Neuropathology%207f62487d3a9d49d9b8f4f4d96c877336/Screenshot_2022-01-12_at_01.32.31.png)

### Simplified Algorithm for Histological and Molecular Diagnostic Approach in Gliomas - Histology

- Selected Diagnostic Biomarkers (often Genetic Mutations) are essential to define and diagnose glioma entities, and are sufficient to resolve a majority of diagnoses
