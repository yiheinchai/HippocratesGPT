# [011] Histology of the Nervous System

# The Nervous System and Its Cell Types

- This consists of two distinct types of cells - neurons and glia
- Half of the brain consists of glial cells, whilst the other half consists of neurons
- The brain weighs roughly 1.4kg, with 700g of neurons and glial cells
- They are intimately interspersed throughout the nervous system with each other so that in a non-pathological setting, there will never be neurons without glia in close proximity to them, and vice versa
- There are 4 Types of CNS glial cells:
1. Astrocytes: Star-like cells
2. Oligodendrocytes: Cells with a few processes that make myelin
3. Microglia: These have an important immune role
4. Ependymal cells: These line the ventricles
- There are 4 Types of PNS glial cells:
1. Myelinating Schwann cells: These are involved in myelination
2. Non-myelinating (Remak) Schwann cells
3. Synaptic Glia (These cover the nerve terminals at synapses)
4. Satellite cells (Found within Ganglia)
5. Enteric glia (Found within Enteric Ganglia)
- There are 3 different types of Peripheral nerve:
1. Somatic Motor Nerves - Provide voluntary control of Muscles
2. Autonomic Nerves (PSNS or SNS) - Providing involuntary control of structures
3. Afferent Nerves - Carry sensory information into the CNS

# Resisting Compression

5 main tissue types:

1. Epithelium
2. Muscle
3. Nervous tissue
- This includes the PNS and CNS
- This tissue type is soft and delicate and therefore, it requires additional mechanical support from surrounding connective tissue
1. Connective tissue:
- This is found filling the gaps between Axons in the Peripheral Nerve
- Fibroblasts are the key cell in making collagen and ECM components, identified by their Large Nuclei embedded in the ECM of the Peripheral Nerve
1. Blood
- The delicate nature of nervous tissue means there must bes interaction between connective tissue and nervous tissue so connective tissue provide mechanical support and protection for nervous tissue
- In the CNS, Connective Tissue is found encasing the Nervous Tissue as bone (skull and vertebral column) and meninges
- As the CNS is located in the bony armour it is protected against external mechanical injuries
- However, a downside of this is that the space is limited, and there is therefore no space for expansion of the CNS due to inflammatory oedema
- Any inflammation would thus result in raised intracranial pressure leading to neurological complications and potentially even death as ICP exceeds Cerebral Perfusion Pressure, leading to Cerebral Ischaemia
- The PNS is not surrounded by bone, and is often compressed (e.g. when sitting)

---

# Types of Peripheral Axons and Glia

- There are two types of peripheral nerve axons:
1. Large myelinated axons (green)
- The myelin Schwann cell wraps itself around the large diameter axon (1 Myelin Schwann Cell is associated with 1 Axon)
- The Nuclei of Myelin Schwann Cells are relatively flattened, light staining and elongated, found very closely associated to the Outer Surface of the Endoneurium
- This can be seen by a thick, darkly staining outer layer surrounding the Axon
- This enables fast axonal transport
1. Small unmyelinated axons (pink)
- These are smaller diameter axons sit in troughs/pockets within in Remak Schwann cells.
- 1 Remek Schwann cell is Associated with multiple Axons
- Here, instead of the Glial Cell Nuclei being flattened against the Endoneurium, the Nuclei are relatively large, non-flattened and darkly staining, with the Axons being found within the Cytoplasm of the Remek Schwann Cell
- They do not need to function in fast signalling pathways
- They lack the thick, darkly staining outer layer that is seen in the Larger Myelinated Axons

### Neuropathic Changes

- In some Peripheral Neuropathies (E.g Diabetes), the regular organisation of the CT-Nervous Tissue architecture within the PNS can become disrupted (as this architecture is fragile)
- The Myelin Sheath contains a large number of Myelin Associated Proteins, usually expressed at low levels except for Protein 0/P0 (20-50% of Myelin Protein), Myelin Basic Protein/MBP (10-20%), MAG and Peripheral Myelin Protein 22/PMP22 (0.2-1%)
- In Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Mutations that lead to Upregulation of the PMP22 Gene by up to 50%.
- CMT1A is the most common type and is caused by a duplication of the PMP22 Gene
- This leads to the Loss of Myelin so very few Axons are Myelinated and Axonal Deaths, making Nerves appear Axon-Sparce with large regions of CT between each axon
- A Pathognomonic Histological Sign of CMT is the presence of Onion Bulbs - Where Modified Schwann Cells are visible but not surrounding an Axon (as the Axon has died), creating multi-layered ring-structures with a centre that stains very light due to multiple cycles of Schwann Cell Proliferation
- It is one of the most common inherited Neuromuscular Diseases

# Protective Neural Layers

- There is no connective tissue found between the Axons of Tracts in the CNS, as there is external protection provided by the bone (CNS only contains nervous tissue)
- As well as the nerve intrinsic support/mechanical protection (endoneurium - CT Layer that surrounds each axon/neuron), peripheral nerves are also protected by two systems on the outside
- This provides the PNS with flexibility

**Perineurium**

- The perineurium (green) is a tubular cellular barrier of connective tissue that surrounds each Nerve and acts as a diffusion barrier
- This is a nerve – tissue barrier that separates the Axon from the Surrounding Extracellular Fluid

**Epineurium**

- The epineurium (orange) is a layer of collagen which surrounds the Perineurium and provides mechanical protection

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.30.51.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.30.51.png)

### DHH and Its Role

- In this image, the perineurium is eight layers of flattened cells with tight junctions in between them to form a cellular tube that surrounds the Nerve
- The dots of collagen fibrils on the outside is the epineurium and collagen fibres here are less compact/more diffuse that they are in the Perineurium
- The Tight Junctions of the Perineurium is an epithelial feature but they originate from Connective Tissue. Therefore, the Perineurium is an example of Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition, where Mesenchymal Cells acquire Epithelial Characteristics
- Desert hedgehog (Dhh), secreted by Schwann Cells, controls the formation of perineurium and epineurium
- It acts on Mesechymal CT Cells to drive the Mesenchymal-Epithelial Transition that allows for the Formation of the Perineurium and Epineuriium
- If this protein is knocked out, there is effectively no perineurium (very irregular and thin) and there is no epineurium
- This mutation is known in humans and leads to wide-scale nerve pathology

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.31.53.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.31.53.png)

- Overall, the PNS is protected by  Schwann cell precursors, producing fibroblasts that generate connective tissue inside the nerves

# Grey and White Matter

- In the brain, the grey matter (mainly neuronal cell bodies) is on the outside and the white matter (dominated by lipids such as in myelinated axons) is on the inside
- In the spinal cord, the white matter is on the outside and the grey matter is on the inside

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.33.34.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.33.34.png)

- This is stained for myelin
- 2nd Order Nociceptive neurons are found in the superficial dorsal horn of the grey matter (they do not project outside the CNS but project to the Brain)
- These neurons send their axons via the white matter up to the cerebral cortex
- The cell bodies of motor neurons are found in the ventral grey matter
- Their axons travel out through the ventral root to the PNS

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.34.18.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.34.18.png)

---

# Ganglia

- Autonomic Ganglia contains the Cell Bodies of the Postganglionic Neuron and Synapses between the Pre and Postganglionic Neuron, where minimal signal integration occurs due to the simplicity of the synapse
- Dorsal Root Ganglia do not contain synapses but contain the cell bodies of the Sensory Neurons, whose axon bifurcates, with a Central Process entering the CNS and a Peripheral Process going out to Peripheral Receptors

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 14.59.56.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_14.59.56.png)

- The arrangement of Neurons, Glia and Connective Tissue follows the same principles in Ganglia as in peripheral Nerves
- Ganglia appear as multiple cell bodies, surrounded by Satellite Cells
- Histologically, the Cell bodies stain Dark purple and are surrounded by Connective Tissue that stains a lighter purple but appears slightly speckled (Unlike Nerves which appear Granular with Nuclei embedded randomly within the Nerve)
- The Cell bodies may be surrounded by a very thin membrane/layer of cells which appear Highly Cellular/Granular (Satellite Cells)

# Neuronal Cell Types and Shape

### Types

- Neurons can be classified based on whether their Cell Bodies and axons are found in the CNS, PNS or Both
1. Some neurons stay completely within the CNS (e.g. corticospinal projection neurons)
- Their cell bodies and processes (axons and dendrites) are in the CNS
- Another example is the nociceptive neurons
1. Some neurons stay completely within the PNS (e.g. postganglionic neurons)
2. Some neurons cross the boundary and are found both in the CNS and PNS
- CNS Neurons develop from the Neural Tube whereas PNS Neurons develop from Neural Crest Cells
- Dorsal root ganglion neurons have the cell bodies outside the CNS but send processes to the PNS and CNS

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.35.35.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.35.35.png)

### Shape

- H&E is not particularly informative when it comes to nerve cells as you cannot see axons or dendrites, only the nuclei/cell bodies
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.36.41.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.36.41.png)
    
- Camillo Golgi invented the “Golgi stain” which stains around 10% of the neurons in the brain, at random but completely
- The method was improved upon by Ramon y Cajal
- Neurons do not appear in the same form as the textbook neuron

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.37.24.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.37.24.png)

# Cerebellar Cortex

- There are Purkinje cells, Stellate cells, Basket cells, Golgi cells and Granule cells
- They all interact in a variety of ways
- The cerebellum is vital for controlling and co-ordinating movement
- The only output from the cerebellum to the rest of the nervous system is from the Purkinje cell
- This output is inhibitory as it releases GABA and hyperpolarises the target
- This is one of the largest neurons in the brain
- Almost all of the cerebellar cortex cells are inhibitory except for the granule cell
- This is the only excitatory cell in the cerebellar cortex and releases glutamate
- This is one of the smallest neurons in the brain and are found in the Midline of the Cerebellar Cortex

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.41.11.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.41.11.png)

### Purkinje Cells

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.42.14.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.42.14.png)

- They have a widely branching, extensive dendritic tree
- This shows developing Purkinje cells
- The dendritic tree of a single Purkinje cell receives between 100,000 and 200,000 synapses
- This huge input is integrated by a single cell body (to which all the dendrites are connected) and integrates this into a single inhibitory AP or not

# Synapses and the Neuromuscular Junction

### Neuromuscular Junction

- They are found in 2 Forms :
1. Somatic NMJ (Somatic Motor Neuron and Skeletal Muscle)
2. Autonomic NMJ (Somatic Motor Neuron and Smooth/Cardiac Muscle)

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.44.32.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.44.32.png)

## Somatic Neuromuscular Junction

- The AChRs are focused as clusters/aggregates on the peaks/ridges of the junctional folds
- The axon terminal is surrounded by a Schwann cell (neurons are never without glia)
- The synaptic vesicles are packaged in Active Zones (Found opposite Peaks of the Junctional Folds)
- Basal lamina in fact runs through the synapse and bifurcates at the edges of the Synapse to surround the Schwann cell and axon presynaptically and the Postsynaptic Membrane, extending into the Postsynaptic Junctional Folds

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.45.33.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.45.33.png)

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.46.02.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.46.02.png)

### Basal Lamina

- This is a proteinaceous layer (Mainly Collagen Type IV and Laminin) which coats the cell membrane of many cells to link them to surrounding CT via Collagen Type I in the CT
- In the NMJ, it is present between the Axon Terminal and Postsynaptic Sarcolemma
- It contains a number of signalling molecules and is important for the control of cellular differentiation and cellular behaviour
- In the NMJ, it maintains the integrity and specialisation of the NMJ as Signalling proteins from the Nerve Terminal and Postsynaptic Sarcolemma bind to proteins in the Basal Lamina, activating signalling mechanisms to the cells on the other side of the Basal Lamina to maintain their integrity

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 15.17.11.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_15.17.11.png)

- The Basal Lamina can be visualised under EM Microscopy as a thin, very dark line running outside the Cell Membrane, with collagen fibres extending superficially from the Basal Lamina and binding to Collagen Type 1 Fibrils in the ECM

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 15.28.58.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_15.28.58.png)

## Autonomic NMJ

- Each Neuron involved in the Autonomic NMJ branches at its distal end to form Varicose Fibres, which contains varicosities (localised balloonings) along its length
- Each Varicosity along these Varicose Fibres is a transmitter release site, comparable to the classical axon terminal of the Somatic NMJ, with the propagation of an AP through the Varicosity triggering Neurotransmitter release into the ECM, which diffuses across to stimulate Smooth Muscle cells
- There are evident histologically (EM) as localised dilations/widenings of the Varicosity Fibres, closely surrounded by multiple smooth muscle cells
- Here, the Membrane of the Varicosity and the Smooth Muscle cell is non-folded and relatively simple and a Myelin Schwann cell can be seen surrounding the Varicosity
- Varicosities do not form a synapse with well-defined prejunctional and postjunctional specialisations but involve the release of Neurotransmitters from Varicosities onto unspecialised region of Smooth Muscle
- This allows each neuron to exert a diffuse control over a large number of smooth muscles that the varicosities/varicose fibres come into close proximity with
- These varicosities can control both nearby and distant Smooth Muscle cells as these Smooth Muscle cells are linked via Gap Junctions, through the effects of the Neurotransmitter on the stimulated cell (usually changes in [Ions]) can diffuse through to affect neighbouring cells
- Therefore, Autonomic Motor Units do not exist as varicosities provide strong control of nearby SM Cells but weaker control of more distant SM Cells

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 15.34.56.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_15.34.56.png)

# Afferent Nerve Endings

- Pain Nerve Endings are the most superficial and extend into the Stratified Squamous Epithelium of the Skin
- Hair Follicle Receptors wrap around the Hair Follicle to detect touch via movement of the Hair
- The Skin is extremely mechanosensitive to touch due to Meissener's Corpuscles

![Sensory Receptors in the Skin (Add to Anki)](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_15.45.33.png)

Sensory Receptors in the Skin (Add to Anki)

- Dermal Papillae appear like tooth-like projections of the Dermis into the Epidermis

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 15.49.09.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_15.49.09.png)

- Within these Papillae, Meissener's Corpuscles can be found
- These consist of Transverse layers of Modified Schwann Cells (Stacked into a Column) and appear more granular (Higher [Nuclei]) than the rest of the Dermis, with nerve fibres taking a wavy path in between these layers to reach the tips of the Papillae
- They contain 3 different types of Afferent Nerve Endings:
1. Myelinated Afferents at the tips of the Papillae
2. Unmyelinated Varicose Afferents (Afferents with Varicosities along their length) which run along the Outer Margin of the Papillae
3. Unmyelinated Nonvaricose Afferents running between the Layers of Schwann Cells

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 15.50.12.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_15.50.12.png)

- Pacinian Corpuscles are found within the Hypodermis and Histologically, they stain much lighter than the surrounding tissue (almost white and speckled) and are arranged as concentric rings of 20-60 modified Schwann Cells, with a central darker staining region where an Unmyelinated Afferent Fibre terminates (Looks like a White Onion)

# CNS Synapses

- These synapses are mainly on dendrites in the CNS but some are on cell bodies and axon terminals (but not on the axon shaft)
- The average neuron is estimated to receive between 6000 and 10,000 synapses but purkinje cells have far more
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.54.30.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.54.30.png)
    
- These are seen histologically by 2 Circular Axons, containing lots of Vesicles whose cell membranes are touching.
- The areas of axon membrane that are in contact with each other are darkened

![gr2.jpg](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/gr2.jpg)

### CNS Synapse Types

1. Gray Type I:
- These have round vesicles
- They are generally excitatory (release glutamate)
1. Gray Type II:
- These have flattened/oblong vesicles
- They are generally inhibitory (release GABA)
- Gray denotes the name of the person who used EM on synapses, not the colour
- The signals controlling CNS synapse development are much less well understood (as opposed to the NMJ)
- Dendrites can often receive input from both Gray Type I and Type II synapses, which it has to integrate to determine whether an AP is generated or not
- Release Sites/Active Zones of these synapses are found where in regions of the Synapse where the Synapse is in contact with the Dendrite and appear much darker than other regions around the Synapse

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 16.37.42.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_16.37.42.png)

- Astrocytes are found in a similar arrangement to PNS Myelin Schwann Cells (Flattened nuclei pressed against the Neuron Cell Membrane) and have processes that entirely surround the Dendrite and any synapses
- Some of the Neurotransmitters released in the Presynaptic Membrane at the CNS binds to receptors on the Astrocyte, allowing the astrocyte to secrete molecules into the Synapse to contribute to Synaptic Transmission

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 17.23.42.png](%5B011%5D%20Histology%20of%20the%20Nervous%20System%205ccb933d297e4fb4bd0212d1f658bfdb/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_17.23.42.png)
