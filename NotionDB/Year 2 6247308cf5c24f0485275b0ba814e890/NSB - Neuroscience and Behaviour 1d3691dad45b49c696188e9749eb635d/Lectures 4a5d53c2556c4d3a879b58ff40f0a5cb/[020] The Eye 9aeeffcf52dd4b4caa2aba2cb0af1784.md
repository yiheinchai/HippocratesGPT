# [020] The Eye

# Visible Structures of the External Eye

- The Palpebral fissure is the elliptical gap found between the Upper and Lower eyelids when measured in the Sagittal Plane
- The Palpebral Fissures have medial and lateral endpoints called the medial and lateral cathus
- The lacrimal caruncle and plica semilunaris are components of the medial canthus
- The Plica Semilunaris is found more lateral than the Lacrimal Caruncle
- The Plica Semilunaris is a thin strip of pink tissue found between the Sclera laterally and the Lacrimal Caruncle medially
- The Lacrimal Caruncle is a triangular-shaped structure at the medial corner of the eye and is the remnants of the nicticating membrane, the caruncle (a transparent, third eyelid found in many animals)
- The Anterior aspects of the eye ball that are visible are:
1. Sclera - White part of the eye
2. Cornea - Translucent part of the eye that is found over the Iris and Pupil
3. Iris 
4. Pupil

# Conjunctiva

- This is the outermost layer of the eye that is visible
- The conjunctiva is a thin transparent film that covers the inside of the eyelids anteriorly and is reflected/extends onto the anterior surface of the visible part of the sclera
- The Conjunctiva does not cover the cornea
- It starts as the Innermost layer of the Eyelid (In contact with the Underlying Eyeball)
- The region of the Conjunctiva that covers the inside of the Eyelid is called the Palpebral Conjunctiva.
- The Palpebral Conjunctiva projects posteriorly until it reaches the Border of the Eyelid and the Eyeball, where it folds back on itself to cover and merge with the superficial most layer of the Sclera
- The Recesses where the Palpebral Conjunctiva folds to form the Bulbar Conjunctiva is called the Fornices
- The region of the Conjunctiva that covers the Sclera is called the Bulbar Conjunctiva
- It covers the sclera until the boundary where the Sclera becomes transparent and becomes the Anterior Epithelium of the Cornea (The Corneal Limbus)
- Hence it attaches to the Superior edge of the Inside of the Eyelid and the Corneal Limbus
- It secretes oils and mucous that helps to lubricate the surface of the eye (prevents it from drying out) as well as keep it clean
- It is innervated via the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1) and receives its blood supply from the ophthalmic artery

# Subconjunctival Haemorrhage Vs Hyphaema and Conjunctivitis

### Subconjunctival Haemorrhage

- This is bleeding under the Conjunctiva but not the eyeball (the eyeball is not damaged)
- Ophthalmic Artery supplies the Conjunctiva via very small vessels (normally not visible on the Sclera) that run between the Sclera and Conjunctiva
- When there is a Subconjunctival Haemorrhage due to rupturing of these vessels, the Haematoma is trapped between the Sclera and the Conjunctiva
- Due to the tight attachment of the Conjunctiva to the Corneal Limbus, the bleeding/haematoma will have a clear/defined border with the Cornea/Iris and will not extend onto the Cornea
- This can occur due to raised IOP (E.g During strong coughing/sneezing), with Hypertension being a risk factor for the occurrence of Subconjunctival Haemorrhages
- These are usually pain-free (may cause mild irritation) and do not affect vision as they do not cover the Cornea
- These are usually self-resolving and do not require surgery/intervention but can take a long time to clear, depending on their size, as the drainage of blood from this area can be quite slow

### Hyphaema

- This is bleeding of the eyeball itself (the eyeball is damaged), causing blood to collect in the Anterior Chamber of the Eye
- Bleeding here causes the Haematoma to pool inside the Cornea and cover the Iris
- This is usually painful and causes blurring/loss of Vision due to blood collecting and obscuring the Cornea, preventing light from entering the eye
- These must be resolved via surgery/drainage

### Conjunctivitis

- This is a highly contagious infection of the Conjunctiva, commonly found in young children
- They can cause mild irritation and pain to the eye but usually resolve quickly

# Eyelids

- They are comprised of Multiple Layers, from superficial to deep:
1. Skin (This contains no fat and is, hairless except for lashes at the edges)
- No Subcutaneous fat is found within the Eyelids
1. Orbicularis oculi muscle (Innvervated by CN VII - Facial)- This is a sphincter muscle that runs centrally from the Orbital Margin
- It is involved in scrunching the eyelids and is comprised of 3 concentric layers, an Orbital, Palpebral and Lacrimal Part moving from Superficial to Deep,
- The Orbital Part is large and wide, arising from the Medial Palpebral Ligament and surrounding bone, extending above the eyelids.
- This is responsible for screwing the eyelids to provide added support
- It runs laterally around the Forehead, Temple and Cheek to insert to its origin medially
- The Palpebral Part is smaller and loops around the margins of the eye entirely within the eyelids
- This part is responsible for gently closing the eyes when sleeping and when blinking
- The Lacrimal Part is the smallest and arises from the Bone behind the Lacrimal Gland and runs into the Eyelid

![327355_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.gif](%5B020%5D%20The%20Eye%209aeeffcf52dd4b4caa2aba2cb0af1784/327355_1_En_1_Fig3_HTML.gif)

1. Levator palpebrae superioris muscle (Skeletal Muscle Innervated by CN III - Oculomotor) - This is responsible for raising the Upper Eyelid
- The Tendinous fibres of Levator Palpebrae enter the eyelid and attach to the Upper Part of the Tarsal Plate whilst extending beyond this, running anteriorly along the superior surface of the Eyeball to intermingle with the Fibres of Orbicularis Oculi more anteriorly
- It contains voluntary fibres innervated by CN III and involuntary fibres supplied by SNS nerves
1. Tarsal plates – These are plates of fibrous cartilagenous tissue that stiffen and strengthens the eyelids
- The conjunctiva adheres to the deep surface of the tarsal plates and tarsal muscle (smooth muscle)
- The Inferior Tarsus is attached to the Lower Orbital Margin
- The Superior Tarsal Plate is larger than the Inferior Tarsal Plate
- The Tarsal Muscles are innervated by Sympathetic Fibres
- The Tarsal Plate acts as the attachment site for a thin layer of Tarsal Muscles and the Levator Palpebrae Superioris
- Medial and lateral Palpebral Ligaments attach the tarsal plates and hence, the Eyelids to the orbit
- The Medial Palpebral Ligament is strong and Lies in front of the Lacrimal Gland
- Palpebral Fascia forms an Orbital Septum which attaches each of the Tarsal Plates to the margin of the Orbit
1. Ciliary glands and tarsal glands - These are found on the tips of the Eyelids which secrete oils to lubricate the eyelashes and the rim of the eyelids
2. Palpebral Conjunctiva 
- The sensory innervation of the upper lid is provided by the Ophthalmic Division of Trigeminal Nerve (CN V1)
- The sensory innervation of the lower lid is provided by the Maxillary Division of Trigeminal Nerve (CN V2) via the Infraorbital Nerve
- Within the Eye, Two Types of Glands are found, the Ciliary and Tarsal Glands
- Immediately Posterior to the Roots of the Eyelashes, the Ciliary Glands are found
- When these become infected, they form a Stye (red swelling on the Lid Margin)
- Tarsal Glands are organised into Vertical/Sagittal Rows that run along the Deep Surface of the Tarsal Plates
- Their ducts open onto the Lid Margin and they are innervated by CN V1

# Ptosis - Conditions of the Eyelid

- Ptosis = Drooping or falling of the upper eyelid (sometimes called a lazy eye)
- If this occurs unilaterally, it can cause the affected eye to drop below the level of the unaffected eye
- This can occur Unilaterally or bilaterally
- Ptosis can have multiple causes:
1. The Levator Palpebrae and Superior Tarsal muscle might be affected due to muscle damage/weakness, damage to/stretching of the Muscle Aponeurosis that attaches these muscles to the eyelid (Most common cause)
- Both of these degenerations are associated with old age or can be congenitally as parts of syndromes where there is a lack of or weak development of the muscles (Notable the Levator Palpebrae Superioris)
1. It can also be caused by an Oculomotor palsy, paralysing Levator Palpebrae Superioris as well as the Extraocular Muscles
2. It can also be a symptom of Horner’s syndrome
- Horner’s syndrome symptoms are ipsilateral to the side of the sympathetic trunk lesion in the trunk/neck
- It usually presents as Unilateral minor Ptosis (due to Tarsal Paralysis), Constricted pupil/miosis (Due to unopposed PSNS Activity), the eyeball appears retracted (due to relaxation of the Smooth Muscle Layer of the Eye) and there is decreased sweating on the affected side of the face as well (anhydrrosis)

![Screenshot 2021-10-31 at 21.13.35.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Eye%209aeeffcf52dd4b4caa2aba2cb0af1784/Screenshot_2021-10-31_at_21.13.35.png)

# Lacrimal Apparatus

- The Lacrimal gland is found in the on the Superolateral Aspect of the Eye, superolaterally within the Orbit (Anterior to the Supraorbital Border of the Frontal Bone)
- It has a small palpebral part anteriorly that extends into the Upper Lid
- Ducts extend from the Lacrmal Gland and open up into the Upper Fornix to secrete lacrimal fluid onto the eye
- Lacrimal fluid washes obliquely from superolateral to inferomedial across the eye
- Lacrimal caniculi are small channels that drain lacrimal fluid and are found in the medial aspects of both eye lids, with an external opening called the lacrimal punctum found on the swollen medial end of the medial eye lid called the Lacrimal Papilla
- The lacrimal caniculi open into a lacrimal sac found in the medial aspect of the orbit, which drains  inferiorly into the nasolacrimal duct via the Lacrimal Bone, finally to the nasal cavity underneath the Inferior Concha of the Lateral wall of the Nasal Cavity
- The Nasolacrimal Duct drains into the lateral wall of the Nose to Nasal Cavity
- The lacrimal gland is innervated by the Ophthalmic division of the Trigeminal Nerve (CN V2)
and the Facial Nerve (CN VII) and the PSNS is responsible for the initiation of lacrimal fluid secretion
- As the Attachments of the Lacrimal and Palpebral Parts of Orbicularis Oculi are found medial and lateral to the Lacrimal Gland, contraction of the muscle squeezes the lacrimal gland to allow for lacrimal fluid secretion
- As Orbicularis Oculi relaxes, tears are drawn into the Lacrimal Sac on the Medial side of the Orbit
- When too much Lacrimal Fluid is produced than can be drained by the Lacrimal Caniculi or the Mucosa of the Nasolacrimal Duct is inflamed, Lacrimal Fluid will leave the eye over the Medial Canthus, causing crying
- The Levator Palpebrae Superioris and Superior Rectus Muscles are found just medial to the Lacrimal Glands and when these muscles contract (E.g During Blinking), the Lacrimal Gland is compressed/squeezed, causing the release of Lacrimal Fluid onto the Eye

# Eye Ball Anatomy

- The eyeball has a Globular structure, as a hollow sphere with a domed anterior protrusion
- Its walls are comprised of Three Layers, from superficial to Deep:
1. Sclera
2. Choroid 
3. Retina
- Anteriorly, the Sclera becomes transparent to become the Cornea
- The Sclera is dense and white
- The Cornea is continuous with the Conjunctiva at its margin
- It has an posterior epithelial layer which is elastic (Posterior Limiting Lamina)
- The Choroid is extremely vascular and is continuous anteriorly with the Lens, Iris and Structures involved in the Accommodation Reflex to form the Middle layer of the Eye
- The Ciliary Body is found between the Iris anteriorly and the Choroid posteriorly
- The Iris is attached to the anterior surface of the Ciliary Body and the lens is attached to its ciliary process which projects Medially.
- The Lateral part of the Ciliary Body forms the Ciliary Muscle, which radiates medially from the Scleral Spur
- The Retina is continuous anteriorly with the Ciliary Muscles of the Eye
- The eye is divided into Anterior and posterior cavities:
- The anterior cavity is further divided into the anterior and posterior chamber by the iris and the pupil.
- The Anterior Cavity is filled with aqueous humour (quite watery in comparison to the vitreous humour)
- The posterior cavity/vitreous chamber is filled with vitreous humour, a jelly like substance
- CN II enters the Eye at the Posterior Aspect of the Eyeball (Fundus)
- The Hyaloid Canal is a channel that runs anteriorly from the Fundus. It passes through the vitreous humour and Hyaloid membrane and is an embryological remnant of the channel that carried a small branch of the Central Artery of the Retina to supply the growing/developing Lens in Utero
- The Vitreous body is condensed superficially to form a membranous envelope called the Vitreous Membrane
- The Vitreous Membrane is thickened anteriorly to form the Suspensory Ligaments of the Lens whilst the membrane is thin posteriorly
- The Suspensory Ligament holds the lens in the Hyaloid Fossa and maintains tension on the Periphery of the Lens when the eye is at rest/focused on distant objects to flatten the lens
- In the Anterior aspect of the Posterior Cavity, the posterior surface of the lens and the ciliary processes form a concavity in the Vitreous Humour called the Hyaloid Fossa
- Once the Lens has reached its adult size, the blood vessels supplying it anastomose and disappear

# Cornea

- The cornea is a layered transparent structure covered with an stratified Squamous epithelium
- It contains no blood vessels or lymphatics in healthy individuals
- In some pathologies, blood vessels can invade the Cornea and hence, impact vision
- The epithelium covering the Cornea contains no stem cells but new cells migrate inwards from the periphery (Conjunctiva) to allow for turnover of the Stratified Squamous Epithelium
- The Cornea is comprised of tiny fibrils (20-60 nm), organised into layers with alternating layers
- The alternating arrangement of the corneal layers means that the gaps within the corneal layers are smaller than the wavelength of light, meaning that there is minimal distortion of light that hits the Cornea
- It accounts for 40 out of 60 diopters of refractive power of the eye
- The Cornea and Conjunctival are highly sensitive to touch
- Corneal reflex: Nasociliary nerve from the Ophthalmic Division of the Trigeminal Nerve (CN V1) convey afferents from the cornea following stimulation (Touch/Temperature etc.) whist Branches of the Facial Nerve (CN VII) carry efferents to the Orbicularis Oculi Muscle to initiate the motor response to close the eye
- As the cornea is avascular and lacks Lymphatics, there is little immune response directed against the Cornea, meaning it can be transplanted without the need for immunosuppressants

---

# Anterior Cavity of the Eye

- The Cornea and the overlying Stratified Epithelium forms the dome on the anterior-most surface of the Eyeball
- The innermost membrane of the Cornea is the Posterior Elastic Membrane which is continuous centrally in the eye with the Iris
- Where the Posterior Elastic Membrane/Limiting Lamina surrounds the Iris posteriorly, the Membrane breaks up into bundles with small spaces between them
- This makes it Porous and permeable, forming the Pectinate Ligament, which allows for Aqueous Humour to flow from the Anterior Chamber into the Scleral Sinus/Canal of Schlemm and finally, into the Scleral Venous Sinuses
- The Iris is a ring-shaped sphincter muscle comprised of Sphincter Pupillae and Dilator Pupillae Muscles on the anterior aspect of the Eye.
- The Sphincter Pupillae consists of circular fibres arranged around the Inner margin of the Iris
- The Dilator Pupilae consists of Fibres which radiate outwards to the periphery of the Iris from the Inner/Pupillary Margin
- The Cornea is anterior to the Iris and the Lens is posterior to the Iris
- The Iris contains Melanin and the more melanin that is present in the Iris, the Darker the Iris appears.
- The Peripheral aspects of the Iris are connected to the Pectinate Ligament and to the anterior part of the Ciliary Body
- Eyes appear different colours as the Anterior layer of the Iris contains little Melanin whilst the Posterior Layer contains most of the Melanin. Therefore, when the light passes through the Anterior Layer of the Iris, the varying [Melanin] in this layer between individuals causes light to be diffracted to varying degrees, causing different wavelength of light to be reflected, causing varying eye colours
- Where the Sclera becomes the Cornea towards the middle of the Eyeball, The Sclera protrudes slightly posteriorly into the Anterior Chamber, to form a small projection called the Scleral Spur
- Where the Iris muscle projects laterally to form the Ciliary Muscle and bends/folds medially on itself to run posterior to the Iris, it forms the Ciliary Body
- The free medial edge of the Ciliary Body forms the the Ciliary Process and is raised into ridges by the Suspensory Ligaments
- Suspensory Ligaments are arranged circularly, attaching to the Ciliary Processes and covering on the Central Lens to suspend it
- The Hyaloid Membrane is found attached to and running over the the Posterior surface of the Ciliary Body, Suspensory Ligaments and Lens which surrounds the Posterior Cavity
- The Anterior Chamber is found between the Cornea Anteriorly and the Iris and Pupil Posteriorly
- The Posterior Chamber is found between the Lens, Ciliary Process and Suspensory Ligament Posteriorly, the Ciliary Body Laterally and the Iris and Pupil anteriorly
- These Chambers are continuous through the Apeture of the Iris/Pupil and both contain Aqueous Humour

![Screenshot 2021-11-01 at 08.33.22.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Eye%209aeeffcf52dd4b4caa2aba2cb0af1784/Screenshot_2021-11-01_at_08.33.22.png)

# Flow of Aqueous Humour in the Anterior Cavity

- Aqueous humour is secreted by the ciliary process/body in the posterior chamber of the Eye and flows medially along the underside of the Iris and anteriorly through the pupil to enter the anterior chamber
- The posterior limiting/elastic lamina of the cornea contains many small openings in the pectinate ligament, connecting the anterior chamber and the scleral canal/Canal of Schlemm, through which the aqueous humour drains to reach the episcleral veins and join the Venous System
- Blockage of this drainage system results in reduced drainage but normal production, increasing the volume of Aqueous Humour in the Anterior Chamber. This leads to increased intraocular pressure and can subsequently damage the optic nerve and the blood vessels supplying it and the retina. This can lead to necrosis of the retina and death of the Optic Nerve and hence compromise vision.
- This is called Glaucoma and there are 2 main forms of this:
1. Primary/Open Angle Closure Glaucoma - The Iris Bows anteriorly (Iris Bombe) due to weakness of the Iris Muscles so that the medial aspect of the Iris projects posteriorly
- This reduces the space between the Lens and the Medial Aspect of the Iris through which Aqueous Humour can flow into the Anterior Chamber, causing it to accumulate in the Posterior Chamber between the Lateral Iris and the Lens and hence causing the pressure here to increase
1. Closed Angle Closure - Closed Blocking of the Pores of the Pectinate Ligaments (E.g Excessive Growth of Blood Vessels supplying the Iris) prevents the drainage of Aqueous Humour into the Scleral Canal, causing it to accumulate within the Anterior and then Posterior Cavities, causing the Pressures here to increase
- Glaucoma is often slow and progressive, making it often difficult to detect due to a gradual decline in vision until it has progressed significantly, with pronounced Optic Nerve Damage

# Iris and Pupil Reflex

- The pupil diameter is adjusted according to light conditions by varying the size of the opening via the action of the Iris – pupillary constriction reflex
- The Preganglionic SNS Fibres that innervate the eye arise from the Thoracic Spinal Cord and ascend in the Sympathetic Trunk to synapse with Postganglionic SNS Fibres in the Upper Cervical Sympathetic Ganglion
- Postganglionic Neurons then run with the Carotid Arteries and the Ophthalmic Artery to reach the Orbit
- Within the Orbit, they pass through the Ciliary Ganglion without Synapsing, joining and running within the Long Ciliary Nerves or travelling along the Long and Short Ciliary Nerves (Branches of the Nasociliary Branch of CN V1) to reach their target (Dilator Pupillae)
- Parasympathetic impulses constrict the pupil as PSNS Fibres travel down the Short Ciiary Nerves, which branch from the Oculomotor Nerve and innervate the Sphincter Pupillae, causing this muscle to contract and constrict the pupil
- As SNS fibres have a long course, lesions that are far away from the Eye (E.g In Apex of the Lung such as a Pancoast Tumour) could affect the Sympathetic Trunk and hence, the SNS Innervation of the Eye, leading to Miosis
- Compression of the Oculomotor Nerve is common in cases of Intracranial Swelling/Oedema during/following severe injury to the head. This causes Ipsilateral Mydriasis (due to damage to PSNS Fibres) which is often sluggish/non-responsive to light

![Screenshot 2021-11-01 at 08.35.03.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Eye%209aeeffcf52dd4b4caa2aba2cb0af1784/Screenshot_2021-11-01_at_08.35.03.png)

# Lens Anatomy and Anchoring

- The lens is avascular and asensory with an ‘onion-like’ lamellar structure, comprised of consecutive layers
- It is suspended in the Anterior Chamber, behind the iris, from the surrounding ciliary processes and muscles, via the suspensory ligaments of the lens
- When the eye, looking a medium distance away, lens is fairly flat whilst the Suspensory Ligament is tense (which pulls the lens flat)
- The lens is completely clear can become opaque/cloudy (old age, too much UV exposure, trauma etc. - Cataract) leading to the resulting loss of vision
- This is treated by replacement of the lens

![Screenshot 2021-11-01 at 08.36.26.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Eye%209aeeffcf52dd4b4caa2aba2cb0af1784/Screenshot_2021-11-01_at_08.36.26.png)

# The Lens and Accommodation

- The Stretch status and dimensions of the lens alter the degree at which it refracts light and focuses it onto the Retina
- Ciliary muscle (parasympathetically innervated, via CN III) contraction draws the suspensory ligaments anteriorly and reduces the diameter of the rim of the Ciliary Processes onto which the Suspensory Ligaments attach.
- This relaxes the suspensory ligaments and reduce their tension, causing the lens to become less flat/more rounded (which is its natural resting shape)
- This changes the shape of the lens to make it more rounded to bring nearby objects into focus by increasing the angle of refraction
- Changing the shape of the lens via the contraction of the Ciliary Muscle = Accommodation and occurs when there is a shift from looking at objects far away to nearby to allow the eye to focus on nearby objects
- Accommodation is the combination of relaxation of the lens with narrowing of the pupil (both under parasympathetic innervation), along with the converging of the eyes/visual axis
- When looking at far away objects, the lens is pulled flat by the suspensory ligaments

# Autonomic Innervation of the Eye

### Sympathetic

- The Long Ciliary Nerves (From CN V1) convey SNS Fibres to the Dilator Pupillae from the Thoracic Sympathetic Trunk via the Carotid Plexus

### Parasympathetic

- The Short Ciliary Nerves (From CN III) convey PSNS Fibres to the Sphincter Pupillae and Ciliary Muscle

![Screenshot 2021-11-01 at 08.38.53.png](%5B020%5D%20The%20Eye%209aeeffcf52dd4b4caa2aba2cb0af1784/Screenshot_2021-11-01_at_08.38.53.png)

# Parasympathetic Ganglia of the Head and Neck

1. Ciliary ganglion - This contains PSNS Neurons that project to the Sphincter Pupillae and Ciliary Muscle of the Eye
2. Submandibular ganglion – This contains neurons that innervate the salivary glands of the mandible
3. Pterygopalatine ganglion – This contains neurons that innervate the lacrimal gland of the eye and nasal glands
4. Otic ganglion – This contains neurons that innervate parotid gland (salivary gland of the
face)
- These are autonomic, paired and non-terminal ganglia
- Together, these 4 ganglia supply all the parasympathetic functions to the head and neck
- They all have a motor root which synapse within the ganglia on postsynaptics fibres that innervate the target organ
- They all receive postsynaptic sympathetic fibres via a sympathetic root which pass through these ganglia without synapsing (as they are postsynaptic and hence, have previously synapsed)
- They all receive a sensory root for general sensations which also travels through the Ganglia without synapsing within it.
- In some cases, these sensations might also be special senses (e.g. taste).

# Uveal Tract - Choroid

- This is found in the Posterior Cavity of the Eye
- It is part of the uveal tract, which forms the middle layer of the eye and is comprised of the Iris, Lens and Ciliary Body in the Anterior Cavity and the Choroid in the Posterior Cavity
- It is the largest aspect of the Uveal Tract
- This is a highly vascular layer and dense, which is the source of nutrition to the Retina, supplying it via gas exchange/diffusion.
- It also supplies blood to the Anterior Cavity of the Eye
- The Blood Vessels that run within the Choroid arise from the ciliary arteries, which are branches of the Ophthalmic artery from the Internal Carotid Artery
- The human choroid contains a thick layer of melanin which limits and reduces uncontrolled reflection of light
- Some other non-primates which are partially/fully nocturnal contain a layer of reflective tissue called the Tapetum Lucidum within the Eye to reflect light to allow them to see in the dark

# Retina - Upside Down Layering

- The Retina is the light-sensitive tissue layer of the eye
- It shows Upside Down Layering as the Deep Layer of the Retina (Furthest from the Posterior Cavity) is light sensitive and overlain by various other cell types and the Choroid
- It is responsible for the transduction of light in the form of converting photons into electrical signals which the visual system of the brain can interpret occurs in the photoreceptors (rods, cones, photosensitive ganglion cells) found in the deepest layer of the retina
- However, these photoreceptors are found deep to the highly vascular Choroid, limiting the amount of light which reaches these photosensitive cells
- The ganglion cell layer consists of millions of ganglion cells which connect to the optic nerve
- The inner synaptic layer consists of synaptic connections between cells in the more superficial ganglion cell layer and cells in the deeper bipolar cell layer.
- Horizontal cells of the bipolar layer are laterally extending cells and synapse with photoreceptors.
- They act as inhibitory interneurons
- The photoreceptor layer of the retina consists of photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) and is the deepest layer of the retina
- They are responsible for image formation and the 'light-trapping' power of the retina
- The pigmented epithelium is the outermost/deepest layer of the retina that sits next to the choroid of the eye

# Structures of the Retinal Fundus

- The Fundus is the most posterior part of the retina, where the Optic Nerve and Retinal Arteries and Veins enter the Eyeball and enter the Choroid to supply the Retina
- It is the region of the Retina that is visible via an ophthalmoscope through a maximally enlarged pupil
- Optic disc – This is the location of optic nerve fibres and blood vessels leaving the eye. This appears lighter than the rest of the Fundus and is found slightly medial (3mm) to the visual axis
- The fibres of the Optic Nerve build up in a circular zone as they leave to form the Raised Edge of the Optic Disc whilst the central part of the Disc forms a depression/pit
- Here, the Optic Nerve is still surrounded by all 3 meningeal layers, which fuse with the Sclera
- At the Optic Disc, the Optic Nerve, Short Ciliary Nerves, Long Ciliary Nerves and Retinal vessels also pierce the Sclera
- The Region of the Retina where the Optic Disc is found forms the Blindspot as no rods/cons (photoreceptors) are found here (this is compensated for by the brain so it does not compromise vision)
- Macula lutea – This is lies directly in the visual axis, with a depressed centre is depressed
(fovea centralis). This region stains darker than the surrounding retina
- This is the area of maximal retinal resolution power AKA where the most accurate vision occurs
- Branches of Retinal arteries and veins can be seen emerging from the Optic Disc, running superior and inferiorly but away from the Fovea Centralis so they do not disturb vision
- The Retina appears red due to its high vascularity
- Raised ICP causes the margins of the Optic Disc to become swollen

# Clinical Significance of the Fundus

- The fundus can be used to check for health conditions such as:
1. High blood pressure (this causes enlarged/dilated retinal vessels which appear rigid - Where Retinal Arteries cross Veins, the veins may become compressed)
2. Diabetes - This is characterised by sites of Neovascularisation (Growth of New Blood Vessels that do not arise from the Retinal Vessels, often seen by the appearance of lots of branches from a point that isn't found at the Optic Disc), Microaneurysms, Oedema and Exudates (Small localised regions where the Retina appears less red) and Cotton Wool Spots (Localised regions with defined borders where the Retina stains very light due to Localised Retinal Necrosis)
3. Ruptures of choroid vessels
4. Tumours
