# [025] Introduction to Neuroanatomy

# Terms in Neuroanatomy

- Axons have branches that are called a collateral
- Nearly all axons have branches/collaterals so that they can connect to more than one place
- A neuron projecting to somewhere means that it sends its axon to that place
- Collections of neuronal cell bodies are called ganglia in the PNS and nuclei in the CNS - These are different to cell nuclei
- Axons are normally found in collections/bundles:
o These are called tracts in the CNS
o These are called nerves in the PNS
- Projection neurons project from one region or nucleus to another, whilst interneurons connect neurons within the same area of nucleus

# Synapses

- Neurotransmitters are released at the end of the axon and diffuse across synapses, which are connections between neurones
- These can be inhibitory or excitatory
- The major excitatory neurotransmitter of the CNS is glutamate
- The major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the CNS is GABA
- Information travels down an Axon from the Dendrites to the Synapse/Axon Terminal
- Glutamate is not only an excitatory neurotransmitter but is also toxic to nerves, killing nerves via excitotoxicity when too much glutamate is released into the synapse
- There are lots of systems in the brain and spinal cord that take up glutamate from the extracellular space in order to tightly control glutamate levels.
- Glutamate is often involved in the later stages of many neurodegenerative diseases

# Cranial Nerves

- CN I = Olfactory Nerves - These end anteriorly as the Olfactory Bulb, which is the anterior end of the Olfactory Tract which arises from Olfactory Areas of the Cerebral Cortex
- Optic Nerve is found just inferior to the Posterior end of the Olfactory Tract.
- The Optic Tract is found posterior to the Optic Chiasm and projects to the Thalamus
- Oculomotor Nerve arises from the Anterior Aspect of the Midbrain (Junction between Pons and Midbrain)
- The Trochlear Nerve is very small and is the only Cranial Nerve to emerge from the Posterior Aspect of the Midbrain and runs anteriorly around the Midbrain to project superiorly along the anterior surface of the Brainstem
- Trigeminal Nerve arises from the Lateral Aspect of the Anterior Pons (Junction between the Pons and Middle Cerebellar Peduncle)
- The Abducens nerves arises medially from the Anterior Pons, at the Border between the Pyramids and the Pons
- The Abducens has a long intracranial course and hence, is vulnerable to damage when there is head trauma
- The Facial Nerve arises from the Anterolateral Aspect of the Medulla, along the Anteroinferior Border of the Pons, between the Pons, Medulla and Cerebellum
- The Vestibulocochlear Nerve also arises from the Anterolateral Medulla, just posterior to the Facial Nerve
- The Glossopharyngeal, Vagus and Cranial Accessory Nerves all arises from the Anterior Medulla, just lateral to the Olives, with the Glossopharyngeal Nerve arising most superiorly and the Accessory Nerve most inferiorly
- The Rootlets of the Hypoglossal Nerve are found anterior to CN IX-XI, emerging from the Anterior aspect of the Olives, between the Pyramids and the Olives (Medial Border of the Olives)

# Olfactory and Cranial Nerves

### Olfactory Nerve

- Olfactory Sensory Neurons have their cell bodies in the Olfactory Epithelium and send axons deep through the Cribiform Plate to synapse on the Olfactory Bulb of the Brain
- They detect any chemicals which have dissolved within the Mucous lining the Olfactory Epithelium
- The OSNs are particularly vulnerable as they are exposed to the environment within the Olfactory Epithelia of the Nasal Cavity and hence, are regularly damaged and replaced by stem cells throughout life.
- This may be the means by which our olfactory preferences for certain smells change over the years
- Detection of flavours requires Olfaction (Flavours are mostly provided by Smell vs Taste) and the Olfactory Nerves contain special glial cells
- The loss of Olfaction occurs in Parkinson's and was recognised as a negative indication of likely life expectancy in the elderly, alongside reduced walking speed

![Screenshot 2021-11-01 at 13.06.17.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-11-01_at_13.06.17.png)

### Optic Nerve

- This contains sensory axons that arise from Neurons in the Retina and project to the brain
- Optic Nerves are CNS tissues and not true peripheral nerves, covered by Meninges
- This means they can be affected by Multiple Sclerosis and Raised ICP, with the Latter  Leading to Papilloedema (Optic Disc Swelling) due to compression of the Optic Nerve by CSF surrounding it
- The axons from the Nasal (Medial) Half of the Retina decussate in the Optic Chiasm, from which the Optic Tracts extend posteriorly into the Thalamus via the Contralateral Optic Tract
- Axons from the Temporal (Lateral) side do not decussate in the Optic Chiasm and hence enter the Thalamus via the Ipsilateral Optic Tract
- The Two Optic Nerves meet at the Chiasm, where Decussation of the Optic Nerves occurs

# Development of the CNS

- The nervous system is derived from neural plate epithelium
- This invaginates and forms a groove
- The lateral lips of the neural groove then come together, and this forms the neural tube
- The neural tube then buds off from the epithelium
- The neural crest cells form from the lateral lips of the neural groove and form the majority of the PNS, ganglia and glia, found anterolateral to the Neural Tube.
- The neural tube forms the CNS
- This all occurs in the first month of pregnancy and the closure should be completed in the first month
- There are neural tube defects where the neural tube fails to close - Anencephaly and spina bifida are examples of neural tube defects
- Folic acid is preventative of Neural Tube Defects and needs to be taken before the first month of development (usually before pregnancy is confirmed) in order to be beneficial as pregnancies are often identified after neurulation has occurred

# Brain Vesicles

- The rostral end of the neural tube expands/swells to form the brain, forming 3 brain vesicles:
- These are the:
1) Forebrain vesicle (blue - Most superior)
2) Midbrain vesicle (green - Middle Vesicle)
3) Hindbrain vesicle (orange - Most Inferior)
- The neural tube caudal to the Hindbrain Vesicle will form the spinal cord
- Two 'rabbit-ear' shaped outgrowths are then formed from the original forebrain vesicle and become much larger than the other vesicles
- These outgrowths are the two cerebral hemispheres and together form the telencephalon
- The telencephalon comprises of two cerebral hemispheres
- The original forebrain vesicle is now called the diencephalon
- The diencephalon will form all the structures with 'thalamus' in its name (E.g Hypothalamus and Thalamus)
- Inside each cerebral hemisphere is a lateral ventricle
- Each lateral ventricle opens through the interventricular foramen on each side, into the third ventricle which is a midline ventricle found in the diencephalon, surrounded by the Thalamus and Hypothalamus on each side.

# Structure of the Brain

- Each cerebral hemisphere is covered with grey matter, and lots of neuronal cell bodies are found here
- Between the 2 Cerebral Hemispheres, the Longitudinal Fissure is found, which is filled in life by the Falx Cerebri

### Brain Stem

- The brainstem extends down to the spinal cord and consists of (superior to inferior):
1) Midbrain
• The midbrain vesicle does not enlarge as much the other brain vesicles and is found above the pons
2) Pons
• It is a bridge-like structure when it is viewed from the front
• It is an oval-like swollen part of the brainstem which protrudes anteriorly
3) Medulla oblongata
• This is the lowest part of the brainstem which is continuous with the spinal cord
- The Brainstem is important for 2 main reasons:
1) It is where most of the cranial nerves originate from
o Cranial nerve nuclei are found here
2) The reticular formation is found here
o These are a set of phylogenetically old neurons
o They are responsible for controlling integral involuntary processes such as breathing, heart rate and blood pressure
- On top of brain stem sits diencephalon.
- Diencephalon is made up predominantly of the Thalamus (Slightly superoposterior to the Midbrain) and the Hypothalamus (Slightly superoanterior to the Midbrain)
- Thalamus is above hypothalamus.
- Hypothalamus: controls autonomic nervous system and other things.
- Thalamus: gateway for information relayed to the cerebral cortex
- Posterior to the brainstem, is the cerebellum - it coordinates movement primarily (ensures movements are smooth and not jerky) but also has other functions
- The cerebral cortex is involved in thought processes and is organised into Sulci/Sulcus (depressions or fissures in surface of brain.) and Gyri/Gyrus (ridges on cerebral cortex. Generally surrounded by 1 or more sulci)
- It is formed from the Telencephalon, which grows laterally and inferiorly to surround and enclose much of the rest of the brain

![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.31.11.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.31.11.png)

# Meninges of the Brain

- The Posterior Half of the Superior Sagittal Sinus is very large and contains lots of blood so Damage here can result in massive Haemorrhage
- The Arachnoid Mater does not extend into the Sulci but is found overlying/bridging the Sulci, running over the Gyri only
- The Falx Cerebri (Double Layered) prevents rotation of the brain within the cranial cavity during the rotation of the head, preventing damage to the Neurovascular structures of the Brain
- The Tentorium Cerebelli covers the Posterior Cranial Fossa and runs between the Occipital Lobe Superiorly and the Cerebellum Inferiorly
- The Tentorial Notch is the anterior free border of the Tentorium Cerebelli which allows the Midbrain to pass through the Tentorium Cerebelli

# Ventricular System and CSF Circulation

### The Ventricles of the Brain

- The original forebrain vesicle becomes the diencephalon (blue)
- It mainly consists of the thalamus (superior) and hypothalamus (inferior)
- In the middle of the diencephalon is the third ventricle (outlined in yellow)
- The lateral ventricles open into the third ventricle via each interventricular foramen
- The midbrain is coloured in green
- From the third ventricle, there is a canal called the cerebral aqueduct/Aqueduct of Sylvius which goes down through the midbrain and opens up into the fourth ventricle (brown)
- The fourth ventricle is located between the cerebellum and the brainstem
- The Lateral ventricles have 3 horns:
1) Anterior horn: extends into frontal lobe.
2) Posterior horn: extends into occipital lobe.
3) Inferior horn: extends into temporal lobe.
- The Brain and spinal cord are bathed in CSF due to the inability of brain and spinal cord to retain a fixed shape (they are jelly-like and hence, do not hold shape/form very well).
    
    ![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.33.10.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.33.10.png)
    

### CSF Circulation

- Ventricles contain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
- This is made by choroid plexuses, vascular structures which are found in all brain ventricles, but most significantly in the lateral ventricles
- The lateral ventricles are larger than the other ventricles.
- The largest choroid plexus is therefore unsurprisingly, the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricle which makes much of the CSF
- From the lateral ventricles, CSF drains through each interventricular foramen to the third ventricle (yellow)
- The CSF then goes through the cerebral aqueduct, which passes through the midbrain, into the fourth ventricle (found between the Brainstem and Cerebellum)
- It then leaves the fourth ventricle to enter the subarachnoid space
    
    ![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_21.57.47.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_21.57.47.png)
    
- It leaves the fourth ventricle mainly by the median aperture of the fourth ventricle (Largest Aperture) which is between the cerebellum and pons, to enter the subarachnoid space/cisterna Magna, posterior to the brainstem
- The CSF, once in the subarachnoid space (Cisterna Magna) travels around the CNS before travelling up around the brain to enter the Superior Sagittal Sinus
- Here it enters arachnoid granulations (collections of arachnoid villi), where it is reabsorbed back into the circulation
- The 2 Lateral Apertures are located on the Anterior Aspect of the Brainstem, between the Pons and the Medulla but these are blocked by the Choroid Plexi so very little CSF leaves the 4th Ventricles here

![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.33.31.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.33.31.png)

### Hydrocephalus

- When flow of the CSF is interrupted this can result in hydrocephalus, where the ventricles of the brain become swollen and increase in pressure as the flow of CSF is blocked
- Some children have congenital stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct due to mutations in the L1 adhesion molecule and sometimes it can be caused by tumours that occlude the Cerebral Aqueduct
- CSF is still produced despite the fact that there is nowhere for it to drain (CSF is unable to enter the Superior Sagittal Sinus where it is absorbed)
- This results in an increase in pressure within the lateral and third ventricles, leading to their subsequent enlargement.
- The lack of CSF flow through the Cerebral Aqueduct means that the 4th Ventricle shrinks in size.
- The swelling of the ventricles is dangerous as it causes compression of the brain as the brain is a cavity of fixed volume
- Congenital stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct be treated by inserting a shunt from the third or lateral ventricle to the peritoneal cavity but must be diagnosed and treated quickly in order to be effective.
- A Third Ventriculostomy can be used to treat Hydrocephalus, where a hole is made in the Floor of the Third Ventricle to allow CSF to drain directly into the Subarachnoid Space (bypassing the Cerebral Aqueduct which has been blocked)
- When ICP > Pressure within Cerebral Arterioles, this stops blood flow through the Cerebral Vasculature, leading to Cerebral Ischaemia

# Landmarks

- The cerebellar peduncles connect the cerebellum to the brainstem
- These cannot be seen in a sagittal section as they lie laterally on each side of the midline, and therefore can only be seen in parasagittal sections
- A peduncle is a stalk-like structure
- They are found on the right and left sides
- There are three cerebellar peduncles on each side (6 in total):
1) The superior cerebellar peduncle connects the cerebellum with the midbrain
2) The middle cerebellar peduncle connects the cerebellum with the pons. This is the largest cerebellar peduncle
3) The inferior cerebellar peduncle connects the cerebellum with the medulla oblongata

![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.37.11.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.37.11.png)

- The image on the right shows the brainstem posteriorly:
- Anteriorly the border between the Medulla Oblongata and Pons is easily identifiable whereas posteriorly, this is not the case.
- The midbrain is distinctive posteriorly as it has four teardrop-shaped bumps arranged as a square
- These are called colliculi and form the Tectum. They are divided into two superior and two inferior colliculi
    
    ![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.51.14.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.51.14.png)
    
- There is a clear posterior distinction between the pons and medulla
- The floor of the fourth ventricle is the diamond-shaped region outlined in red
- Inferior Vertex of the Floor of the 4th Ventricle = Obex
- The Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle is found directly medial to the Middle Cerebellar Peduncle and the Superior Cerebellar Peduncle is found superomedial to the Middle Cerebellar Peduncle, superior to the Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle
- The peduncles have been cut in the image, but they are still somewhat visible
- The middle cerebellar peduncle is much larger than the others, and it is the only one that can be seen without dissecting the front
- The image on the left shows an anterior view of the brainstem:
- On each side of the pons there is the massive cerebellar peduncle, which are the swellings seen lateral to the pons

# Spinal Cord

- The spinal cord is the simplest part of the CNS
- It consists of outer white matter and inner grey matter
- This shows the meninges around the spinal cord
- The meninges are connective tissue around the CNS
- The tough outer layer of the meninges is called the dura mater. It is extremely thick
- The arachnoid mater is much thinner than the Dura and is stuck to the inside of the dura
- The pia is the innermost vascular layer which intimately surrounds the CNS. As it is tightly adherent to the CNS, It enters all the grooves and fissures of the CNS
- There is a connection between the pia and the arachnoid on each side of the spinal cord called the denticulate ligament. This holds the spinal cord in place
- There is a potential space between the Arachnoid and Dura Mater called the Subdural Space. This only becomes an actual space if there is a haemorrhage into this potential space
- The subarachnoid space is between the arachnoid and pia and it contains CSF
- Blood vessels supplying the CNS are found in the subarachnoid space (inferior spinal artery shown)
- If the blood vessels bleed, they bleed into the CSF
- Ventral Median Fissure is seen running down the Midline on the Anterior Surface of the Spinal Cord
- CSF is jelly like so it is able to support the CNS

# Sections of the Spinal Cord

- There is grey matter and white matter
- The grey matter contains lots of cell bodies of neurons
- There is no complete boundary or membrane between grey and white matter
- The grey matter of the spinal cord is organised into Dorsal and Ventral Horns
- Like the dorsal roots of spinal nerves, the dorsal horn of grey matter is sensory in function
- Like the ventral roots of spinal nerves, the ventral horn of grey matter is motor in function
- The central canal is found in the middle and is lined by ependymal cells
- This is not a tube that conveys CSF down to the lumbar spinal cord but does contain CSF
- The white matter is also divided into regions:
- There are dorsal, lateral and ventral columns of white matter. Lots of axons go up and down the spinal cord within the white matter to allow axons to reach different spinal levels.
- The Dorsal Columns of White Matter are found on the Posterior Surface of the Spinal Cord, Medial to the Dorsal Horns
- Below T6, only one Dorsal Column is found, containing Fasciculus Gracilis and Above T6, 2 Dorsal Columns are found, containing the Fasciculus Gracilis medially and Fasciculus Cuneatus Laterally
- The white matter contains axons that travel up and down the spinal cord to leave/enter at different spinal levels from which they flow into the Grey Matter
- White matter is most abundant in the cervical spinal cord and least abundant in the sacral spinal cord

![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.56.50.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_12.56.50.png)

### Spinal Cord, Spinal Nerves and Meninges

- Spinal Nerves are attached to the Spinal Cord by a series of Dorsal and Ventral rootlets that combine to form the Dorsal and Ventral Roots
- Segments of the Spinal Cord are named after the spinal nerve/spinal nerve rootlets that they are attached to, not their associated vertebra (E.g Sacral Segments give rise to Sacral Spinal Nerves but are round in the Upper Lumbar Region)
- Spinal Cord only reaches down to L1/L2 Intervertebral Disc/Transpyloric Plane (Conus Medullaris) but dorsal and ventral nerve roots of Inferior Spinal Segments extend lower down to form the Cauda Equina which supplies the Pelvic Region and the Lower Limbs
- Denticulate Ligaments are found connecting to the Pia Mater between the Spinal Nerve Roots (They are Superficial Extensions of the Pia Mater)

![Screenshot 2021-11-01 at 11.44.15.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-11-01_at_11.44.15.png)

### Blood Supply

- There are two smaller dorsal spinal arteries found posterior to the dorsal grey horns
- There is a large anterior artery which arises above from the two vertebral arteries and is found anterior to the Anterior Median FIssure of the Spinal Cord
- It gets an input from segmental arteries via radicular arteries segmentally as it goes down
- Radicular arteries are found along spinal nerve roots to travel to the spinal cord
- The largest radicular artery is the artery of Adamkiewicz which is found on the left at T10
- The anterior spinal artery supplies motor neurons in the anterior 2/3rds of the spinal cord. Notably, the ventral horns, the great descending motor tracts (in the dorsal part of the
lateral column of white matter) as well as the ascending pain and sensory pathways in the ventrolateral white matter whilst the Dorsal Columns remain unaffected
- These regions all degenerate if the anterior spinal artery is blocked
- This can occur due to spinal stroke
- Rootlets of the Spinal Nerves are also found within the Subarachnoid Space

# Rexed Lamina

- Dorsal Ramus of Spinal nerves carries motor fibres (from Ventral Horn, leaving via Ventral Root to enter Dorsal Ramus) to Erector Spinae and the skin overlying erector spinae, and does so segmentally down the body.
- The grey matter in the spinal cord is divided into transverse layers (laminae of Rexed)
- They can be seen very easily in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord where laminae I - VI are present
- The motor neurons in the ventral horn form lamina IX, where they are organised into columns
- Laminae I – VI have sensory function
- Laminae I and II comprise the superficial dorsal horn
- Laminae II specifically is also called the substantia gelatinosa
- The superficial dorsal horn is important as this is where processing of pain occurs
- Substantia gelatinosa: pain fibres are in laminae I and II (superficial dorsal horn) so it is very significant in nociception. Pain is a function of cerebral cortex.

- The motor neurons in lamina IX which are lateral, control the muscles of the extremities
- The motor neurons for the trunk muscles in lamina IX are more medially placed
- The motor neurons supplying flexor muscles are found more dorsally than those supplying extensor muscles
- In the thoracic cord, there is much less grey matter than other regions
- There is still a ventral and dorsal horn
- The thoracic cord (T1-L2) also has a lateral horn where preganglionic sympathetic neurons are found
- Their axons go out through the ventral root, to the sympathetic trunk
- The lateral horn is part of lamina VII

# Injury to Nerves

### Lower Motor Neurone (LMN) Lesions

- LMN lesions involve injury to peripheral nerves (either to the axon or the cell body)
- If a peripheral nerve can be injured due to direct injury or poliomyelitis
- With poliomyelitis, the motor neurons are killed resulting in the death of the whole axon, as opposed to nerve injury which will only result in axonal death distal to the injury
- The signs and symptoms of an LMN lesion include:
1. Flaccid paralysis - It cannot contract as it no longer receives any motor innervation
2. Rapid muscle wasting - This results from a lack of use of muscles as they are no longer innervated
3. Fibrillation and fasciculation:
- These are random, small contractions of individual muscle fibres. These appear as twitching

![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.03.11.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.03.11.png)

- The part of the axon distal to the injury dies as most of the proteins are made in the cell body, with which it has now lost its connection
- Several new axons in the form of axonal sprouts will form from the cell body of the damaged neuron if it is still functioning/undamaged
- Axons will regenerate along the course of pre-existing fibres, and will hopefully innervate the structure that they once did leading to potential recovery of function. This is called axonal regeneration and causes the Motor Unit to increase in size
- This is not the case for the CNS, as axons do not regenerate in the CNS

![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.04.09.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.04.09.png)

- If peripheral nerves are cut, they can be repaired by suturing
- Here, Axons grow from the proximal nerve stump and regenerate across the lesion, down the distal stump
- Hopefully, they will reach their original function and lead to recovery of function
- However, only around 50% of patients with repaired peripheral nerves report a useful degree of functional recovery
- Some recovery of function can sometimes be detected even if muscle action is not present, but this is of little use to the patient
- Neuropathic pain is one consequence of failed functional regeneration
- Damage to preganglionic SNS Fibes within peripheral leads to a lack of SNS Innervation to the target tissue. If this is skin, skin will appear warm, dry and red

![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.05.08.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.05.08.png)

- Axons do not regenerate in the CNS and despite no certain explanation, the three currently presented hypotheses (all of which are partially true) are:
1. Inhibitory Factors are present in the CNS
2. There is a lack of growth-stimulating molecules (Neurotrophins) in the CNS
3. CNS Neurons are unable to alter their gene expression to produce axonal regeneration
- Recovery of function after CNS injury does occur via Plasticity (changes in the connections of surviving neurons to minimise the loss of function)

### Upper Motor Neurone (UMN) Lesions

- The corticospinal tract is found in the lateral column of white matter (Lateral to the grey matter, between the Ventral and Dorsal Horns of Grey matter) with hundreds of thousands of axons on each side
- If there is an injury to the corticospinal tract, the axon beyond that point will die
- Degenerated corticospinal tracts will be replaced by astrocytes via Astrogliosis
- This gives rise to an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion
- These lesions can be anywhere on the descending pathway (e.g. cerebral cortex or spinal cord)

Signs and symptoms of an UMN lesion:

1. Spastic paralysis

o The muscles can no longer be voluntarily controlled
o The paralysis is spastic as reflexes are still intact and so the muscles are still active

1. Little to no muscle wasting:
o As the reflexes are still active and the muscles are contracting, so there is no wasting
2. No fasciculation or fibrillation as the muscles are still innervated
    
    ![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.22.01.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.22.01.png)
    

### Positive Babinski Sign

- Forceful Stroking of the plantar surface of the foot from the heel to the big toe normally results in reflex plantarflexion and flexion of the toes
- In individuals with an UMN lesion, it results in dorsiflexion (particularly of the big toe) which
is called a positive Babinski sign
- The positive Babinski sign also occurs in babies as they have unmyelinated corticospinal tracts and so they are not fully functional
- This is normally the case for around the first year of life

# Tracts in the Spinal Cord

- The basic principle of the central nervous system is that one side controls the other side of the body
o E.g. The right motor cortex is in action when the left arm is moving
- Likewise, one side of the brain receives sensory innervation from the other side of the body
o E.g. The right cerebral cortex receives the nociceptive input of pricking the left index finger and converts it into the sensation of pain
- This means the sensory and motor tracts that connect the brain to the spinal cord decussate (cross the midline)
- This is termed contralateral control, and occurs in other mammals
o Contralateral means on the other side
o Ipsilateral means on the same side
- Descending tracts carry motor instructions from brain to motor neurones.
- Ascending tracts carry sensation up to brain.
- The main descending tract controlling motor function is the corticospinal tract
- The corticospinal tracts arise in the cerebral cortex and end in the spinal cord after decussating at the junction between the Medulla and the Spinal Cord
- It is the only descending tract to control intrinsic muscles of the hand (e.g. movements such as waving and moving fingers)
- The corticospinal tract is the most important descending tract in primates
- Hundreds of thousands of corticospinal neurons start in the cerebral cortex of the forebrain and descend through the forebrain, brainstem and crosses the midline just before it enters the spinal cord
- It then travels down on the contralateral side of the spinal cord and will control motor neurons that control muscles either directly or indirectly (via interneurons)

![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.10.15.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.10.15.png)

# Corticospinal Tract

- Controls all voluntary movement, including fine hand movement via the Intrinsic Muscles of the Hand (they are the only tracts that can produce precise, fine voluntary movements of the fingers).
- Come from/arise in the cerebral cortex, pass in front of brain stem, cross midline/decussate at bottom of brainstem (base of medulla) and descend down the spinal cord on the contralateral side, where they end.
- Corticospinal tracts arise from neurons in the cerebral cortex and pass down the brainstem near its ventral surface to form excitatory synapses on motor neurons and interneurons in the spinal cord

### Section at Upper Midbrain

- The front of the midbrain is called the crus cerebri or the cerebral peduncle
- In the middle of the crus cerebri there is a large bundle of corticospinal axons, found just anterior to the substantia nigra
- In the middle of the crus cerebri, is the corticospinal tract
- The cerebral aqueduct is visible
- Periaqueductal grey is grey matter that surrounds the cerebral aqueduct - It has important roles regarding pain
- On the back of the midbrain are the 4 colliculi, 2 superior and 2 inferior which form the Tectum:
o The superior colliculus is involved in coordinating eye movements and directing vision towards objects
o The inferior colliculus is involved in auditory pathways
- The red nucleus is a motor nucleus on each side of the brain, found just posterior to the Substantia Nigra, which is in turn just posterior to the Crus Cerebri.

### Section at Lower Pons

- On the back of the pons is the fourth ventricle, separating the pons anteriorly from the cerebellum posteriorly
- The corticospinal fibres split up from a singular bundle into lots of separate bundles here
- The ascending sensory tracts are also found here, dorsal to the corticospinal tract fibres

**Basillar Artery**

- The pons is supplied by the basilar artery
- The basilar artery is a short artery, formed from the vertebral arteries, which goes up the front of the pons and gives branches into the pons to supply it
- Some branches just supply the ventral part of the pons containing corticospinal axons and not the ascending sensory pathways
- Lesions of these branches of the basilar arteries, which results in patients being able to hear, see and feel everything but unable to move a muscle (Locked-In Syndrome - Some Px may be able to move their eyes vertically) - Ascending Sensory tracts are preserved whilst Descending motor tracts are destroyed
- Most patients will die
- It is difficult to be diagnose correctly and commonly misdiagnosed as a coma (commonly diagnosed by family vs doctor)
- Comatose patients do not feel pain, whereas patients with locked in syndrome do and the more dorsal ascending sensory tracts are not destroyed

### Section at Open Medulla

### Olives of the Medulla

- The olives are a landmark in the open medulla, just lateral to the pyramids
- The diagram on the upper left shows a single neuron in the corticospinal tract
- On the brainstem, the pons appears swollen
- The midbrain is the least enlarged bit of the original brain
- The fourth ventricle is located between the cerebellum and the pons and medulla
- The central canal extends up through the medulla and goes all the way down the spinal cord
- It opens out into the fourth ventricle so the fluid inside the fourth ventricle is continuous with the fluid that is inside the spinal cord
- The medulla is normally divided into a larger closed medulla and an open medulla
- The closed medulla is any part of the medulla which has central canal inside it
- The open medulla has no central canal and there is fourth ventricle posteior to the medulla
- The open medulla is therefore the highest (most rostral part)
- The image on the upper right shows a cross-section through the open medulla as there is fourth ventricle dorsal to it
- At the front of it, pyramids are seen, and this is where the corticospinal tracts are found
- Just lateral to each pyramid is a bump called an olive
- In the front of the medulla on each side is a big column of axons as each pyramid
- Pyramidal tracts = corticospinal tracts
- The olives contain the inferior olivary nuclei which send axons into the cerebellum
- The olives are therefore a source of axons going into the cerebellum, conveying information into the cerebellum

### Pyramids of the Open Medulla

- Corticospinal tracts form the pyramids on the anterior surface of the open medulla
- The diagram on the upper left shows one corticospinal tract axon coming from a neuron in the cerebral cortex
- The axons go down through the forebrain and brainstem, and then cross over just before the spinal cord, and then going down on the contralateral side of the spinal cord
- It will end on a motor neuron, or more often on an interneuron that controls a motor neuron
- The motor neuron results in muscle contraction
- The corticospinal tracts form the pyramids in the medulla
- All of the corticospinal tract axons are compressed into the pyramids
- There are no other axons other than corticospinal tract axons in the pyramids
- The function of the corticospinal tract can be inferred from selective damage to the pyramids (this is rare)
- However, in a monkey if the pyramids are cut bilaterally, they had more clumsy hands, despite having preserved motor functions otherwise
- The same thing has occurred in the rare cases where humans have had selective bilateral damage to the corticospinal tracts
- The corticospinal tracts can produce voluntary movements of any part of the body
- However, there are other descending tracts from the cerebral cortex which can also help to control voluntary movement
- No other tracts can control fine movements of the hands and fingers
- In primates, the corticospinal tracts control other voluntary motor systems as well
- Quadrupeds (mammals with four legs) can have their cerebral cortex destroyed but they still have motor function
- In primates, motor lesions in the areas of the cerebral cortex result in paralysis of the other side of the body
- The corticospinal tracts are therefore much more important in primates as well as the cerebral cortex control of motor activity

### Section at Upper Closed Medulla

- This shows a section through the closed medulla
- There is a central canal passing through the medulla and no 4th ventricle posterior the Medulla as the section is taken inferiorly to the 4th Ventricle
- This shows the upper part of the closed medulla
- There are no olives found whilst the pyramids are still there
- The main differences between the open medulla and upper closed medulla are a lack of olives and the presence of the central canal

![%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.31.56.png](%5B025%5D%20Introduction%20to%20Neuroanatomy%200f9dc56c60d84b4e936b90e836bf1cce/Screenshot_2021-07-14_at_13.31.56.png)

### Section at Lower Closed Medulla

- Most corticospinal tract axons decussate (cross the midline) here
- The median fissure of the Medulla is partly obscured anteriorly in the lower part of the medulla due to this decussation just above the spinal cord, which partially fill in this fissure
- The pyramids are still present, but the pyramidal tract axons are crossing the midline on each side (Decussation of the Pyramids), with the axons projecting posteriorly and contralaterally.
- They go from the region of the pyramids to the position that they are going to occupy in the lateral part of the white matter in the spinal cord

# Rubrospinal Tract

---

- There are other descending tracts from the motor cortex
- Corticospinal Tract consists of a single neuron from the Cerebral Cortex which synapses on Motor Neurons in the spinal cord
- Cerebral-cortical neurons can send axons down to the red nucleus in the midbrain
- The red nucleus then sends axons which decussate/cross the midline to descend down the contralateral spinal cord
- This is called the rubrospinal tract (Rubro = red, due to the involvement of the red nucleus). Rubrospinal Tract = Cerebral Cortex→ Red Nucleus in Midbrain → Motor Neurons in spinal Cord.
- The rubrospinal tract can also control voluntary movements but not those of the hands and fingers
- Most rubrospinal and corticospinal axons end on interneurons which in turn control motor neurons which lead to muscle contraction
- The rubrospinal tract overlaps with the position of the corticospinal tract in the spinal cord, found in the Lateral Column, overlapping the anterior aspect of the Lateral Corticospinal Tract
- It is very difficult to find selective lesions of the rubrospinal tract as they overlap with the corticospinal tract in the spinal cord
