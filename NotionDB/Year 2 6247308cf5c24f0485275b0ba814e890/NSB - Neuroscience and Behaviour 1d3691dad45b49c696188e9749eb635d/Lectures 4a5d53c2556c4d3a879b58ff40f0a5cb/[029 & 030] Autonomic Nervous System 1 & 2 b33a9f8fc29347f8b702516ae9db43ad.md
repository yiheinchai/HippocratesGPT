# [029 & 030] Autonomic Nervous System 1 & 2

# Function of ANS

- Control activity of internal organs, blood vessels and superficial structures in skin.
- Maintain internal body temperature.
- Coordinate appropriate responses to changes in internal or external environment.
- Does not reach consciousness so it is involuntary
- It has 3 Divisions:
1. Enteric
2. Sympathetic
3. Parasympathetic

---

# Enteric Nervous System

- This is comprised of 2 Plexi (Myenteric and Submucosal) found  between the Muscular Layers of the GI Tract.
- Myenteric Plexus is found between the Longitudinal and Circular Layers of the Muscularis Externa and the Submucosal Plexus is found between the Submucosa and the Circular Layer of the Muscularis Externa
- They can function independently of any CNS input.
- They control peristalsis and regulates absorption and secretion.
- 500 million neurones.

- They receive Inputs from the SNS and PSNS in order to coordinate GI Activity with the activity and state of the rest of the Body
- SNS project inhibitory neurons to the Smooth Muscle of the GI Tract directly and to the Enteric Neurons that in turn, project to the Smooth Muscle, to inhibit smooth muscle contraction here and reduce Peristalsis
- PSNS projects excitatory neurons to the Enteric Neurons that control smooth muscle activity, stimulating smooth muscle contraction here and hence, stimulating peristalsis
- SNS and PSNS Project to the Enteric Neurons controlling the Secretory Epithelium here, leading to Inhibition and Stimulation of Secretions respectively

# Myenteric Neurons and Autonomic Nervous System

### Myenteric Neurons

- Cell types: orphanin FQ, ENK, Calcetrinin.
- Neurotransmitters: serotonin, VIP, somatostatin, ACh (Mainly Peptide).

### Autonomic Nervous System

|  | Sympathetic | Parasympathetic |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Fight or Flight - Prepares the Body for action | Rest and Digest -  |
| Preganglionic | ACh | ACh |
| Postganglionic | NA (Usually) ACh (Sweat Glands and Blood Vessels) | ACh |
- The Majority of the Effect of the SNS on the Lungs is not via the Action of NA from Postganglionic SNS Neurons on cells in the Lungs but via the Action of Systemic A, released into the Blood Stream due to SNS Stimulation
- SNS tends to stimulate Thoracic Viscera (Increase Heart Function and Bronchodilation) and Inhibit Abdominal Viscera function
- SNS Fibres from the Upper Cervical Ganglion innervate the structures in the Head and Neck (Eye, Glands etc.)
- PSNS Tends to oppose the activity of the SNS in order to fine tune the activity of the body so that it is best suited to the state of the body at that point

### Differences Between Somatic and Autonomic Nervous Systems

- Somatic NS contains Neurons in the Spinal Cord that project out directly to skeletal muscle (no synapse) and release ACh at the Somatic NMJ to cause muscle contraction via nAChR activation
- The ANS Contains Autonomic Ganglia, where a synapse is found and ACh neurotransmission occurs
- The use of nAChRs in the Somatic NS allows for rapid and short lasting ocommunication between the Nervous System and muscle whereas the use of mAChRs in the ANS allows for slower but longer lasting effects to be produced by a signal from the ANS
- This means that the activity of the Somatic NS is very focused, often affecting a few associated muscle fibres at one time whereas the Activity of the ANS is much more widespread
- For the Adrenal Gland, the Adrenal Medulla functions like a Modified Ganglion, with Chromaffin Cells in the Medulla acting similar to Postganglionic SNS Neurons but producing Systemic Effects (Project to the Blood Stream vs Structures)
- For the SNS Innervation of the Adrenal Medulla, there is a long Preganglionic SNS Neuron that projects to the Adrenal Medulla, with stimulation of this neuron causing NA and A release from the Adrenal Medulla to produce Systemic SNS Stimulation

# Sympathetic Nervous System

- It has thoracolumbar outflow.
- It has short, un-branching preganglionic neurones that innervate ganglia located close to vertebral column in the Sympathetic Chain/Paravertebral Ganglia or Collateral Ganglia/Prevertebral Ganglia located just anterior to the Aorta.
- Postganglionic neurones have long branching projections to innervate target organs via NAergic Neurons.
- Between the Dorsal and Ventral Horns between T1-L2, there is a Lateral Horn that contains the cell bodies of Preganglionic SNS Neurons in the Intermediolateral Cell Column
- These Preganglionic SNS Fibres (Myelinated) project down the Ventral Root to join the Spinal Nerve, entering the Sympathetic Chain via the White Ramus Communicantes
- They then synapse here and Postganglionic SNS Fibres (Unmyelinated) re-enter the Spinal Nerve via the Grey Ramus Communicans and travel along this to reach their target organs

![Screenshot 2021-11-29 at 11.18.47.png](%5B029%20&%20030%5D%20Autonomic%20Nervous%20System%201%20&%202%20b33a9f8fc29347f8b702516ae9db43ad/Screenshot_2021-11-29_at_11.18.47.png)

### Diabetic Sympathetic Neuropathy

- As Postganglionic SNS Fibres and Small and Unmyelinated, they are extremely sensitive to Damage and Neuropathy in Px with Diabetes
- Diabetic Neuropathy commonly begins with Sympathetic Neuropathy, destroying the smallest neurons first, losing SNS Innervation to structures

### Visualisation of Sympathetic Nerves

- In periphery, only neurones using NA are postganglionic sympathetic neurones.
- Mice genetically engineered to produce enzyme (turns blue) instead of NA and synapse.

# Parasympathetic Nervous System

- It has craniosacral outflow (CN III, VII, IX and X and S2-S4).
- Sacral preganglionic neurones do not join with spinal nerves.
- Cranial preganglionic neurones travel with axons in cranial nerves to reach their target:
- CNIII: pupil size, lens shape, strength.
- CNVII: salivary glands.
- CNIX: smooth muscle and glands of throat predominantly, some viscera of thorax and abdomen.
- CNX: lungs, heart, stomach, small intestines, liver (Thoracic and Abdominal Viscera predominantly).
- Preganglionic fibres are long and branched, Innervating ganglia located on (notably in Viscera) or close to their target organs.
- Postganglionic neurones then have short projections to innervate their target organs
- Whereas the SNS has short, unbranched preganglionic and long, branched postganglionic neurons, the PSNS has long, branched preganglionic and short, unbranched postganglionic neurons

# Autonomic Transmitters and Receptors

|  | Sympathetic  | Parasympathetic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preganglionic | ACh (nAChRs) and ATP (Secondary) | ACh (nAChRs) and ATP (Secondary) |
| Postganglionic | NA (α and β Adrenoceptors) | ACh (mAChRs - M1-M5) |
- Many other transmitters are coreleased in ANS Neurons such as Neuropeptides (VIP, NPY and Substance P) and Small Molecules like ATP, 5-HT and NO

---

# Adrenergic Transmission

- Varicosities (swellings of axon) are similar to the synaptic boutons seen in the Somatic NMJ.
- The location of multiple varicosities along the length of the Axon vs one Terminal Bouton per axon allows for the Axon to make contact with a large number of cells, located in various different places
- These are sites to release neurotransmitter and contain lots of synaptic vesicles and the machinery required to synthesise these.
    
    α1 is coupled to Gq (Excitatory) whereas α2 is coupled to Gi (Inhibitory)
    
- β-AR are all coupled to Gs but β1 tend to be Stimulatory whereas β2 tends to be Inhibitory, with this difference being due to differences in ion channel expression vs G-Protein Activity

---

# Autonomic NMJ

- There is Presynaptic Thickenings of the Varicosities at the sites where the Neurotransmitters are released
- Unlike the Somatic NMJ and Neural Synapses, the Synaptic Cleft between the Varicosity and the Smooth Muscle is very wide to allow the Neurotransmitter to diffuse within the Cleft before it stimulates the Postsynaptic Receptor, producing broad/widespread Neurotransmission that can stimulate a high number of smooth muscle cells at one time - This is Volume Transmission

![Screenshot 2021-11-28 at 18.49.22.png](%5B029%20&%20030%5D%20Autonomic%20Nervous%20System%201%20&%202%20b33a9f8fc29347f8b702516ae9db43ad/Screenshot_2021-11-28_at_18.49.22.png)

# Baroreceptor Reflex

- Pressure sensitive cells are embedded within the Aortic arch and carotid sinus.
- These Cells respond to stretch (amount of distension) in vessel walls, which is directly related to Blood Pressure.
- This therefore provides information about the Blood Pressure as it enters the Systemic Circulation and The Pressure of the Blood that is perfusing the Head - This ensures that the Blood Pressure is always high enough to maintain sufficient perfusion of the Systemic Tissue and the Brain respectively
- Pressure sensed by baroreceptors in aortic arch (via CNX) and carotid sinus (via sinus nerve of Hering (branch of CNIX)) is transmitted to NTS where it stimulates Second Order Baroreceptor Neurons.
- Information about the magnitude of the BP is encoded via Frequency Coding where as BP increases, the Frequency of AP fired down the Neurons increases
- During a Normal Cardiac Cycle, Firing Rate of these Afferents increases during Systole and Decreases during Diastole

![Screenshot 2021-11-28 at 19.26.51.png](%5B029%20&%20030%5D%20Autonomic%20Nervous%20System%201%20&%202%20b33a9f8fc29347f8b702516ae9db43ad/Screenshot_2021-11-28_at_19.26.51.png)

- Parasympathetic: NTS excites the nucleus ambiguus and dorsal vagal nucleus (increases parasympathetic outflow via CN X to the heart).
- Sympathetic: NTS excites CVLM (caudal ventrolateral medulla), which inhibits RVLM (rostral ventrolateral medulla) (RVLM is the main source of descending excitatory fibres).
- Inhibition of the RVLM by the CVLM decreases the magnitude descending excitation of Preganglionic Sympathetic Neurons in Intermediolateral Column (reducing sympathetic outflow to the heart).
- Therefore, this reduction in CO with Stimulation of the Baroreceptor Reflex lowers the BP back to the Set Point
- When BP Falls, there is reduced Excitation of Nucleus Ambiguus and Dorsal Vagal Nucleus (Reduced PSNS Outflow) and there is decreased excitation of CVLM, increasing RVLM Inhibition and hence, increasing SNS Outflow

# Pupillary Light Reflex

- Low light causes pupils to dilate (this is done to maximise the amount light hitting retina during the reflex).
- Shining bright light into 1 eye causes pupil constriction in both eyes (limits amount of light hitting retina).
- Light hits retina → excitation of retinal ganglion cells.
- Some of output from optic tract goes to pretectal area of the Superior Colliculus.
- Pretectal area then projects to Edinger-Westphal nucleus on both sides (Projects to the Contralateral Side via the Posterior Commissure).
- Information is then sent via CNIII to both ciliary ganglia (parasympathetic).
- Short Ciliary Nerves arise from the Ciliary Ganglion and cause Constriction of both sphincter pupillae to narrow the pupils.

# Autonomic and Motor Coordination

- Somatic and autonomic systems often work collaboratively (Sometimes, ANS can function independently):
- External urethral sphincter is under somatic control.
- Bladder wall, neck/Internal Urethral Sphincter are under autonomic (involuntary) control.
- Therefore, in order to allow for Urination to occur, there must be PSNS (Involuntary) and Somatic (Voluntary) Stimulation to the Bladder - The somatic component allows an individual to selectively urinate at different points in the day, when it is appropriate
- Preganglionic SNS Fibres project from the Lower Sympathetic Chain to the Inferior Mesenteric Ganglion (Collateral Ganglion) and Postganglionic SNS Fibres project to the Bladder via the Hypogastric Plexus
- SNS Causes relaxation of the Bladder Wall (Inhibit Smooth Muscle Here) and Constriction of the Internal Urethral Sphincter to allow the Bladder to fill
- Sacral Preganglionic PSNS Neurons project via the Pelvic Nerve to Postganglionic PSNS Neurons found embedded within the Bladder Wall
- These Postganglionic PSNS Fibres project to the Bladder Wall, where they cause the contraction of the Smooth Muscle of the Bladder and relaxation of the Internal Urethral Sphincter, allowing Urine to flow into the Urethra to allow for urination/micturation
- To prevent urination, there is tonic activity of Somatic Motor Neurons projecting from Onuf's Nucleus (Ventral Horn of Sacral Spinal Cord) innervating the External Urethral Sphincter to keep this Sphincter constricted.
- In order to allow for Urine to completely flow out of the Bladder, there must be inhibition of these Motor Neurons in Onuf's Nucleus, allowing the External Urethral Sphincter to relax to allow for Micturition
- Bladder function is controlled from pons micturition centre:
- Sympathetic and somatic activity is high during bladder filling.
- Parasympathetic activity is high during voiding/micturition.

# Spinal Cord Injury and Autonomic Dysreflexia (Mid-Thoracic Level)

- Spinal Cord Injuries are increasing in prevalence, notably in Young Men due to a likely increase in participation in Risk Taking Activities
- Autonomic Dysreflxia occurs when the Spinal Cord is damaged in the Upper/Mid Thoracic Region (Below T4 so that SNS innervation to the Heart is intact whilst SNS Innervation to the Vasculature is damaged),
- Afferent, often Nociceptive Signals (Generally due to Impacted Colon or Overfilled Bladder) from below the lesion can reach the Spinal Cord and cause increased sympathetic drive from the Spinal Cord to local vasculature (Vasculature innervated by Spinal Nerves below the Lesion) via local spinal reflexes.
- However, these signals cannot ascend through the Spinal Cord past the lesion, to reach regulatory centres in brainstem to alter Autonomic Activity.
- Vasoconstriction causes Blood pressure to increase (detected by baroreflex).
- Baroreceptor Reflex decreases Sympathetic drive to heart (bradycardia) whilst sympathetic drive to vasculature below lesion is unchanged as descending signals from the Brainstem cannot descend past the level of the Lesion.
- Voiding signals (from pons to empty the bladder/gut to relieve compaction/fullness of the Colon and Bladder respectively) cannot reach parasympathetic neurones, meaning regions of the Spinal Cord below the Lesion remain sensitive to the Nociceptive Input.
- This means that the compaction or overfilled bladder is not resolved via changes to Autonomic Activity, meaning the spinal signal to ↑ blood pressure via vasoconstriction of vessels innervated below the Lesion persists.
- This presents with Vasoconstriction below the level of the lesion vasoconstriction, Hypertension and with Pronounced Bradycardia (are reduced CO), which significantly reduced tissue perfusion (as CO is unable to maintain blood flow and hence, perfusion against this increased afterload)
- Some Athletes with Spinal Cord Injuries have been reported to compete with Impacted Colons/Full Bladders in order to stimulate A release via the SNS to increase Glucose Mobilisation from Glycogen in the Liver and increase Muscle Glycolysis, which increases the Muscle Performance seen

# Higher Centres Involved in Autonomic Control

- Not just spinal cord and brainstem, as higher structures within the Brain are also able to influence the activity of the ANS:
1. Hypothalamus
2. Forebrain
3. Amygdala
4. Hippocampus
- Flight or fight response typified by:
1. ↑ HR and BP.
2. Pupil dilation
3. ↑ respiration rate
4. Diversion of blood to muscles.
- This response is not just a brainstem response:
- Potential danger needs to be recognised by the Forebrain and Prefrontal Cortex to initiate this response, with these areas also involved in planning actions and considering consequences.
- Hypothalamus initiates and maintains response:
1. Activates sympathetic
2. Inhibits parasympathetic
3. Alters sensitivity of baroreflex, to allow increased HR and BP to maintained simultaneously to increase Oxygen Delivery to Muscles.
4. Promotes cortisol secretion.

# Affective Behaviour

- Emotional states are accompanied by autonomic responses, notably changes in HR and BP, GI function, piloerection (Hairs standing on end), sweating.
- Emotional states also accompanied by complex somatic activities (i.e. facial expressions).
- There are 6 universally recognisable facial features: joy, fear, disgust, sadness, surprise, anger.
- The Prefrontal and Insular Cortices drive emotional responses via stimulation of the Amygdala and the Limbic System
- The Limbic System then drives Somatic responses by stimulating Somatic Motor Nuclei and alter PSNS and SNS Outflow by stimulating PSNS Nuclei and SNS Neurons in the Spinal Cord
- The Hypothalamus can also alter SNS and PSNS Outflow via Projecting to PSNS Brain Stem Nuclei and SNS Neurons in the Spinal Cord
