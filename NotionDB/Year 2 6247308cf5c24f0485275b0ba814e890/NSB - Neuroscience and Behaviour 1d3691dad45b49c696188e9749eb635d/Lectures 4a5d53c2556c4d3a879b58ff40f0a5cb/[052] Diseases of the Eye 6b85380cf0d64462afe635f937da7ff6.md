# [052] Diseases of the Eye

# Ophthalmic View of the Retina

- Paler Area of Optic Disc = Optic Disc Cup. This is where blood vessels supplying the Retina run through/closely associated with the Optic Nerve
- Optic Nerve is described in regards to 4 features:
1. Colour - Usually Orangey-Pink but can appear Hyperaemic (Redder) or Pale, depending on the Degree of Vascularisation
2. Contour - This is dependent on whether the Contour/Outer Rim of the Optic Disc is well defined/clear and sharp or blurry
3. Cup:Disc Ratio - How much of the Optic Disc is occupied by the Optic Disc. This is normally <0.5
4. Vessels - Do vessels appear twisted/coiled, Is there evidence of Neovascularisation (New Vessels branching from pre-established vessels)

# Snellen Chart

- This records the Px's best corrected visual Acuity
- This should be assess for all Px being referred to Ophthalmology
- Px should wear their distance glasses or contact lenses in order to demonstrate the most accurate/powerful corrected vision.
- Px should also be a set distance away from the Snellen Chart in order for the result to be standardised and hence, more valid

# Blepharitis

| Pathology | Inflammatory condition affecting the eyelids caused by chronic staphylococcal
infection and malfunction of Meibomian (lipid) glands, which open up at the base of the Eyelashes. |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | 1) Itchy, gritty, red, watery eyes. 2) Dandruft Like Deposits can be seen on the Base of the Eyelashes 3) Eyelids appear slightly Erythematous around the lesion |
| Treatment | 1) Hot compress 2) Scrub base of the eyelids with damp cotton buds to try remove the Debris from the Eyelash bases to help unblock the Meibomian Glands orifices to help them drain. |

# Chalazion

| Pathology | Firm, round lump in upper or lower eyelid caused by chronic inflammation/blockage of Meibomian gland. This causes the lipid component of tears to accumulate within the Gland. |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Asymptomatic, but unsightly, usually seen as Bumps/Localised Masses in the Upper Eyelids at the base of the Eyelashes. There is sometimes a loss of Lashes around the Lump and the affected eyelid appears erythematous around the lump |
| Treatment | 1) Hot compress, 2) Upper lid massage - These are attempts to unblock the Orifices to drain the Meibomian Glands naturally
3) If not resolution after initial/acute treatment, surgical
incision and curettage to drain/remove the Granulomatous Lipid Material within the Meibomian Glands. |
- The Medial Canthus is much rounder than the Lateral Canthus which has a much sharper angle
- Chronic Chalazion (Present for Long Period of Time) can be distinguished from Acute Chalazion that has recently appeared as in Chronic Chalazion, there is little Erythema of the Upper Lid and there is a full set of eyelashes (none have been lost)

# Pre-Septal and Orbital Cellulitis

| Pathology | Redness, tears, usually in children, inflammation of eyelid due to infection prevents opening. |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | History of cold/fever.
Pre-septal cellulitis: tender, warm, erythematous skin. Some redness of conjunctiva can be seen when the eyelid is opened.
Orbital cellulitis: very painful and reduced range of eye movement possible, proptosis, ↓ visual acuity, RAPD/Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect where the Pupil Dilates in response to Swinging Light Test, reduced colour vision, swollen optic nerve on Fundoscopy. |
| Treatment | Urgent referral (Notably of Orbital Cellultis) |
- Pronounced Erythema can be seen with the entirety of the affected eyelid(s), with affected lids commonly being swollen (sometimes tense and swollen shut)
- Can often cause Px to cry due to pain/discomfort
- Orbital Cellulitis can be sight and life threatening

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 16.04.56.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_16.04.56.png)

- Swinging Light Test is when a light is shone into one eye and then the other in an alternating fashion. Normally, this should produce construction in both eyes each time (Pupillary Light Reflex) but in a Px with RAPD, affected eye will dilate in response to light → This indicates Optic Nerve damage

# Dry Eyes

| Pathology | Symptoms because of ↓ tear production and rapid evaporation of tear (poor quality tears). |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Dry, gritty sensation, watering (Reflex mechanism to compensate for tiredness), soreness, redness |
| Treatment | 1) Hot compress and lid cleaning (Open Meibomian Glands to increase lipid secretion onto the eye) ) 2) Tear film substitutes (prevent evaporation).  |
- When Cobalt Blue filter is placed on a light and shone into the eye covered in Fluorescent Eye drops, Dry Eyes will manifest as lots of small white dots (Punctate Staining) on the Cornea due to Corneal Epithelial Loss when the eye is dry

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 16.05.47.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_16.05.47.png)

# Corneal Abrasion and Subtarsal Foreign Bodies

| Pathology | Fluoride dye with cobalt blue filtered light (Fluorescine Dye) highlights any defects on surface of cornea as it stains corneal epithelium. |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Watery, painful, unable to open eye |
| Treatment | 1) Ascertain underlying mechanism of abrasion. 2) Search and remove foreign body that may be causing corneal microabrasions 3) Chloramphenicol ointment 4) Eyepad for 24 hours
5) Use chloramphenicol ointments 3 x daily for 1 week (ensure no secondary bacterial infection) |
- There is uptake of the Fluorescent Dye on the Central Aspect of the Corneal Surface due to Epithelial Loss here due to Corneal Abrasion
- If there is lots of vertical lines found close to one another on the Surface of the Corneal Epithelium, this is likely due to the presence of a foreign body in the eyelid (Subtarsal Foreign Body) which abrades the Corneal Surface when blinking
- Most Corneal Abrasions usually heal within the First 24-48 hrs due to its high regenerative capacity

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 16.08.12.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_16.08.12.png)

# Metallic Foreign Body in Eye

| Pathology | In Image, rusting has occurred - This is identified by an orange halo/rust ring surrounding the Foreign Body |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms |  |
| Treatment |  |
- By determining the mechanism of foreign body introduction to the eye, this allows to determine whether the foreign body has penetrated the Cornea to enter deeper structures of the eye (E.g Iris)
- This is Rx by placing Anaesthetic Drops in the Eye and slowly removing the Corneal Body

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 16.09.01.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_16.09.01.png)

# Laceration in Cornea

| Pathology | If there is a Full thickness laceration of the Cornea, iris tissue extrudes out of the Iris and plugs the wound to keep integrity of eye. |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms |  |
| Treatment |  |
- If there is a Full Thickness Corneal Perforation, there can also be Iris Tissue extruding outwards from the Plane of the Iris as the laceration has also damaged the Iris
- Corneal Lacerations can be identified by the Cornea being disfigured (an abnormal shape, usually tear dropped, with its apex being found towards the Laceration) due to disruption to the arrangement of the Iris Tissue.

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 16.09.11.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_16.09.11.png)

# Herpes Simplex Keratitis

| Pathology |  |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Gritty sensation within eye, feeling like a foreign body is in the eye. Eye appears watery with redness |
| Treatment | Topical acyclovir 5 x daily for 2 weeks. |
- Thin snowflake/Star Like (Looks like Dendrites) appearance of Structures on the Corneal Surface when visualised using Fluorescein is Pathognomonic for Herpes Simplex Keratitis
- Tends to be caused by HSV-1 (that which causes Cold Sores)

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 16.09.45.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_16.09.45.png)

# Conjunctivitis

| Pathology |  |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Viral: watery, red, gritty eye (no pus/stickiness).
Bacterial: watery, red, gritty, sticky eye (due to pus discharge around the base of the eyelashes) |
| Treatment | Viral: lubricants to minimise Sx (Namely grittiness).
Bacterial: chloramphenicol 4 x daily for 2 weeks.
Important patient has good hand hygiene (as it is very contagious). |
- Eyelid can appear swollen
- Eye can appear Hyperaemic (Red)

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 16.11.53.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_16.11.53.png)

![Screenshot 2021-12-13 at 23.59.12.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-13_at_23.59.12.png)

# Acute Anterior Uveitis

| Pathology | May have underlying condition causing Anterior Uveitis: sarcoid, TB, HLA B27+ if Px presents with Bilateral or Chronic/Recurrent cases |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Aching, water, photophobic, circumciliary injection |
| Treatment | 1) Urgent referral
2) Topical steroids (E.g Dexamethasone Eye Drops) and cycloplegics (Drugs that cause the Pupil to Dilate). |
- Most of the Redness/Erythema is localised to the Superficial Margin of the Cornea due to enlargement of blood vessels here (Circumcorneal/Circumlimbal Injection)
- There is also Abnormal Dilation of the Pupil (Not all Aspects of the Pupil dilate uniformly) so that instead of appearing round, it appears almost semicircular/moon shaped or sometimes, even more irregularly shaped
- This is because where the pupil is not dilating, the Iris tissue is adherent to the Anterior Lens Capsule, preventing it from contracting in order to dilate the pupil
- This is commonly seen up close as the presence of as thin, white fibrous bands adhering the pupillary margins of the iris to the lens, commonly seen extending into the Irregularly shaped pupil → Posterior Synechiae
- Small white clumps of Anterior Chamber Cells can be seen on the Corneal Endothelial Surface (Keratitic Precipitates) → Not stained by Fluorescein as these precipitates are on the Endothelial, not Epithelial Surface of the Cornea
- Dose of Topical Steroids given is initially quite high (Administered every 1-2 hrs), with administration frequency being slowly reduced over the course >6 weeks to completely resolve Inflammation and prevent rebound inflammation.
- Cytoplegic is given to dilate the pupil to reduce discomfort and reduce the likelihood of Posterior Synechiae formation occurring

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 16.13.12.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_16.13.12.png)

# Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma

| Pathology |  |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Sudden onset, painful, ↓ visual acuity due to corneal cloudy, mid-dilated pupil (commonly seen in the dark) |
| Treatment | 1) Urgent referral: to ↓ intraocular pressure (Eyedrops and sometimes Oral/IV Acetazolamide to rapidly reduce IOP).
2) Laser peripheral iridotomy (long-term/definitive treatment) |

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 16.14.22.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_16.14.22.png)

- Cornea appears hazy/translucent and eye appears red/'injected'
- Here, Drainage Angle at the Periphery of the Anterior Chamber can be narrow, reducing drainage here via the Trabecular Meshwork and Canal of Schlemm
- This can be exacerbate in Dark Conditions when Mydriasis further narrows the Drainage Angle to reduce Aqueous Humour drainage
- Laser Peripheral Iridotomy - This makes a hole in the  iris so aqueous humour can drain efficiently from the Posterior into the Anterior Chamber via the Iris instead of the Pupil and hence, out of the Anterior Compartment of the Eye.
- This is commonly done in Px with Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma who have Pupil Block, where the Pupil is adherent to the Posterior Surface of the Lens to prevent Aqueous Humour from draining into the Anterior Chamber of the Eye from the Posterior Chamber via the Pupil

# Central and Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion

| Pathology | Risk factors:
1) Older patients Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Ischaemic Heart Disease, cholesterol.
2) Younger patients → Usually indicated Hyper-coagulable Blood: thrombophilia screen,
hyperhomocysteinuria, anti-phospholipid syndrome, factor V Leiden, protein S, protein C,
anti-thrombin-3 deficiency, oral contraceptive pill. |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Sudden onset of painless visual loss. |
| Treatment | 1) Urgent referral to Ophthamologist
2) Check BP or Blood Sugar to exclude Hypertension or Diabetes Mellitus as a cause. Depending on Findings, Ophthalmologist may choose to
1)) Observe Px to look for signs of Pregression
2) Laser pan-retinal photocoagulation: Periphery of the Retina is ablated to reduce its Oxygen Demand, reducing the risk of Retinal Necrosis that could occur due to the Retinal Metabolic Demand exceeding its Metabolic Supply                                               3) Intravitreal anti-VEGF infections: stops blood vessels being leaky and hence, is mainly done when Macular Oedema is significant. |
- When a Branch of the Retinal Vein is occluded, there is no venous return from the region drained by the vessel.
- Therefore, venous blood pools in the vein distal to the Occlusion, causing yellow deposits on the Retina formed by Proteinaceous and Lipiduous Exudate (potentially Serosanginuous) from Congested Vein segments

![Central Retinal Vein Occlusion](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-14_at_00.19.40.png)

Central Retinal Vein Occlusion

- Vasculature appears enlarged/swollen and tortuous/twisty
- There are flame/Blotch shaped haemorrhages on the Retina

![Screenshot 2021-12-14 at 00.21.24.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-14_at_00.21.24.png)

- Most common cause is Hypertension as this thickens the walls of the Retinal Vasculature, reducing their compliancy/elasticity so that they become stiff and compress adjacent venous structures (Arteriovenous Nicking) to such an extent that they prevent blood flow through the Veins

---

# Central Retinal Artery Occlusion (CRAO)

| Pathology |  |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Sudden Onset Painless Visual Loss |
| Treatment | 1) Urgent Referral to Ophthalmologist and Stroke Team (Highly Indicative of High Risk of Stroke) |
- Retina appears slightly Grey vs Orangey-Yellow (Pale)
- Fovea may appear a noticeably darker red as the Rest of the Retina is Lighter (Cherry Red Spot)
- Retinal Vasculature may appear much thinner
- These signs all occur as the Occlusion of the Central Retinal Artery reduced blood flow down the branches of the Retinal vessels, making the Retina appear white and vessels small
- Sometimes, Cilio-Macular Sparing can be seen, where there is an alternative blood supply to the Macula of the Retina which is not compromised in the Occlusion, making this region of the Macula Appear relatively Darker in comparison to the wider retina (This is healthy whereas the Rest of the Retina is pale as it is hyperperfused)
- Sometimes, emboli can be seen where retinal vessels bifurcate (these appear as light, circular outpouches from the Retinal Vasculature), with the Retina supplied by the Region of the Vessel distal to the Embolism appearing paler/hypoperfused due to the Embolus

![Screenshot 2021-12-14 at 00.37.22.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-14_at_00.37.22.png)

# Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration

| Pathology |  |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Sudden, painless visual loss, loss of central vision, metamorphopsia. Can result from haemorrhage, exudate or fluid at macula |
| Treatment | Urgent referral to Ophthamology |
- Metamorphosia = When the Shapes of Objects appear to be distorted
- Temporal/Lateral to the Optic Disc is the Macula
- This is characterised by an area of Cloud-Like/Fluffy Haemorrhage (Appears darker than surrounding Retina) and lots of yellow dots of Exudate from the distal ends of vessels near to/supplying the Macula
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-12-14 at 00.41.35.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-14_at_00.41.35.png)
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 16.35.19.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_16.35.19.png)

# Diabetic Retinopathy

| Pathology | Poor Blood Sugar control (more likely to occur in Px who have been diabetic for longer). |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms |  |
| Treatment | 1) Control modifiable risk factors: Blood Sugar, BP, cholesterol, weight, smoking.
2) All patients should be under DRSS (diabetic retinopathy screening service) and have Fundoscopies at least once a year. |
- Commonly seen as Small, Dot Haemorrhages at the distal end of Fine Branches, Larger Blot/Flame Shaped Haemorrhage and small yellow dots distributed across the Retina (Cotton Wool Spots)
- Neovascularisation can be seen as the presence of Additional (Highly Numerous), thin vessels emerging from the Optic Disc or nearby vasculature, often showing highly convoluted paths (Not following the Arcing Path of other retinal vessels)
- These are highly fragile and can commonly haemorrhage

![Screenshot 2021-12-14 at 00.43.39.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-14_at_00.43.39.png)

# Retinal Detachment

| Pathology |  |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | Flashing lights (often white and peripheral), floaters (Black Spots in vision), shadow in vision where the retina has detached from the Posterior Eye and is now obstructing the Visual Field of another Retinal Segment. |
| Treatment | 1) Urgent referral to Ophthalmology.
2) Surgical reattachment. |
- Retina appears folded or bulging/ballooning vs smooth and 2D appearance
- This can occur as a Macular On or Off Detachment, where the Macula is still attached or detached from the Wall (The Latter Occurring due to progression of Retinal Detachment)
- Macular Off Retinal Detachment produces more severe/pronounced Sx than Macular On Retinal Attachment
- The Earlier the Surgical Attachment is performed, the Better the Prognosis

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 17.20.52.png](%5B052%5D%20Diseases%20of%20the%20Eye%206b85380cf0d64462afe635f937da7ff6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_17.20.52.png)

# Arteritic Anterior Ischaemic Optic Neuropathy

| Pathology | Older patients > 65 years.
Doesn’t seem to affect Afro-Caribbean’s. |
| --- | --- |
| Symptoms | 1) Sudden loss of vision usually first in 1 eye. Can also present with diplopia if condition spreads to other eye, rapidly progressing to Bilateral Blindness if not corrected/identified quickly.
2) Preceding attack: transient visual obscuration/visual changes, flashing lights that are self resolving.
3) Systemic symptoms: scalp tenderness, jaw claudication (Pain and Discomfort upon sustained chewing), malaise. Visual Acuity of 6/60 from the Snellen Chart or worse. Swollen Optic disc (notably borders/edges are obscured). |
| Treatment | Ophthalmic emergency.
1) Urgent ESR, CRP and FBC (Notably Platelet Count) to identify Inflammation.
2) High dose steroids (Oral and IV or IV Pulse Methylprednisolone) before biopsy confirms Dx to avoid bilateral involvement/blindness.
3) Temporal artery biopsy to confirm diagnosis. |
- Margin of the Optic Disc is obscured whilst Vasculature commonly appears dilated and Tortuous
- It is associated with CRAO so if Px has Hx of CRAO in >65 Px, consider, AAION as DDx
