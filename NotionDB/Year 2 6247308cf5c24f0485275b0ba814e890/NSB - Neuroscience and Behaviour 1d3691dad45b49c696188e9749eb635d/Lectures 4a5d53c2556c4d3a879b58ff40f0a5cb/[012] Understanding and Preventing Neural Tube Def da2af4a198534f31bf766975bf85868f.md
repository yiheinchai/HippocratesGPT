# Death and Neural Tube Defects

### Death

- Stillbirth = Death at end of pregnancy.
- Perinatal death = Stillbirths and all neonatal deaths (Weeks 1-4 Life after Birth).
- % of Stillbirths from NTDs are quite high as Anencephaly is lethal In Utero but % of Perinatal Death from NTDs is rather low as Open Spina Bifida is disabling but not lethal
- Perinatal Deaths are mainly caused by Cardiac or Respiratory Congenital Defects as whilst the function of the Heart and Lungs are predominantly maintained by the Mother In Utero, this is not the case after birth so Defects of these organs present significantly after birth and can be lethal here
- Cleft Lip and Palates are rarely lethal but can impact Speech Development and Feeding

### Neural Tube Defects

- Common CNS malformations.
- 1 per 1,000 pregnancies (varies geographically).
- Over 250,000 cases per year.

There are 4 Main types:

1. Anencephaly (40% of NTDs).
2. Open spina bifida (40% of NTDs).
3. Craniorachischisis (< 10% of NTDs): exposure of brain and spinal cord.
4. Encephalocele (10% of NTDs): sac like protrusion of brain.

# Overview of Neurulation and NTD Generation

### Neurulation

- Primary neurulation by neural folding and Closure - This is the folding of the neural plate to form a hollow neural tube, rostral to S2.
- This begins when Closure 1 occurs (Initial point of closure of the Spinal Cord) and ends when the Caudal Neuropore closes
- Secondary neurulation by canalisation: This is the formation of the Neural Tube within a solid rostral-caudal column of cells, caudal to S2 (Caudal to the Caudal Neuropore)
- The Neural Plate folds at the Median Hinge to form a closed/filled neural tube with no lumen as no Dorsolateral Hinge Points form during the folding.
- Cells within this closed/filled tube begin to condense near the midline and form an Epithelial Layer surrounding a Central Cavity/Lumen.
- This Epithelium begins to thicken and separates from the Surrounding/Overlying tissue to form the Neural Tube, embedded within the Solid Column of Tissue
- Secondary Neurulation occurs once Primary Neurulation has finished (after the Caudal Neuropore has closed)
- As in Primary Neurulation, the Neural Plate folds to enclose an open cavity (Closure vs canalisation of a solid mass), Defects of Primary Neurulation present as an open cavity (incomplete folding of the Neural Plate), creating a defect that is open (continuous with the surrounding cavity)
- As Secondary Neurulation occurs via Canalisation of a solid tissue column, defects of Secondary Neurulation present as a closed defects, where a lack of canalisation means that the Sacral Cord is tethered to surrounding tissue/bone and not found separate within the Vertebral Canal
- Neurulation occurs during week 3-4 (days 21-28).
- Closure 1 = Initial site of closure of the Neural Tube, found at the Junction between the Hindbrain and the Spinal Cord
- Groove is called neuropore and zips up rostral to caudal.

- Closure 2 = Closure of the Cranial Neuropore
- Closure 3 = Closure of the Caudal Neuropore
- Failure of Closure 1 = Cranioachischisis (Anencephaly and Exposed Spinal Cord as if Closure 1 doesn't occur, Closure 2 and 3 also fail) - This is lethal
- Anencephaly (Failure of Closure 2) can either fail due to failed Closure from Closure 1 moving Rostrally or from Closure 3 (Found at the Most Rostral Point of the Embryo, near the Mouth) Caudally
- This is due to failed Closure from Closure 1 moving caudally
- The earlier that Closure of the Caudal Neuropore from Closure 1 fails, the higher up the lesion occurs and hence, the more severe the defect
- Closed Spinal Dysraphism = Failure of Secondary Neurulation (Spinal Cord does not form properly and is tethered to other tissues and covered by skin/not exposed)

# Two Hit Hypothesis of Open NTD Development

**Anencephaly**

1. Failed Cranial Neurulation - Failure of Closure 2 
2. Exencephaly - As the skull does not form over the Superior Aspect of the Brain (Due to failed Closure 2), the Brain continues to grow and protrudes outside the Cranial Cavity into the Amniotic Sac 
3. Anencephaly - In the Amniotic Sac, the Brain is exposed to amniotic fluid, which is neurotoxic, leading to brain atrophy, causing the Superior Aspect of the Head to appear flat with little to no nervous tissue present

# Origin of NTDs in Utero

### Failure of Neural Tube Closure (Craniorachischisis)

- This is a failure of closure 1.
- Closure 1 needs Planar Cell Polarity
pathway (PCP)
1. In the PCP Pathway, WNT Signals binds to a Cell Membrane receptor called Frizzled, causing 3 other Membrane Proteins (Vangl2, Ptk7 and Celsr1) to associate together and attract the Cytoplasmic Protein Dishevelled towards the Inner Surface of the Membrane to form a Complex
2. This complex attracts various other Cytoplasmic proteins at the Inner Surface of the Cell Membrane to activate Downstream pathways with regulate the Cytoskeleton, which allows for cells to change shape and migrate
- Therefore, Inactivation of the Membrane Proteins and Dishevelled (Or failure of Dishevelled Migration to the Cell Membrane) causes failure of the PCP Pathway in the Neural Plate, preventing the Formation of the Median Hinge Point and Folding of the Neural Tube, leading to Failure Neural Tube Closure (Closure 1), leading to Craniorachischisis

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 18.22.52.png](%5B012%5D%20Understanding%20and%20Preventing%20Neural%20Tube%20Def%20da2af4a198534f31bf766975bf85868f/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_18.22.52.png)

- This causes the Neural Tube (usually long and narrow) to be short and wider, causing the Organism to be shorter and wider
- The movement of Neural Plate Ectodermal cells towards the Midline and their extension rostrally and caudally down the Midline as the neural tube closes (Convergent Extension - Making the Neural Tube long and thin instead of short and wide) is dependent on PCP Signalling
- This lack of Convergent Extension means that cells in the Middle Segment of the Neural Plate are non-motile and do not undergo Convergent Extension (Do not migrate rostrally and caudally)
- This disrupts midline bending of the Neural Plate so that the regions of the Neural Plate that fold towards one another are rather far apart (Neural Plate looks U shaped rather than V shaped as the Neural Plate region that does not fold is widened) as Medial Cells cannot fold/migrate
- This wide midline horizontal portion means that the lateral aspects of the Neural Plate that are folding are too short to fuse in the Midline, leading to Craniorachischisis

# Causes of NTDs

- Folic acid deficiency alone is not responsible for NTDs. There needs to be exacerbating factors of a genetic defect in splotch (PAX3) gene.

### Genetic Risk Factors

1. Folate metabolism (mainly genes encoding Mitochondrial Folate Enzymes).
2. Failure in PCP Signalling (Mutation of Membrane Proteins or Dishevelled)
3. Human Genetic Variants - Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms

### Environmental Risk Factors

1. Drugs taken during Early Pregnancy-  Valproic Acid (Anticonvulsant), Fumonisin (Fungal Toxin)
2. Deficiency of Folate, Inositol, Vitamin B12, Zinc.
3. Diabetes, obesity
4. Folate antagonists: fumonisin, trimethoprim
5. Hyperthermia, fever

# Prevention of NTDs

- Whilst Maternal Folate Deficiency by itself is not a cause of NTDs, it is a strong risk factor for NTD Development and when present alongside a Genetic Predisposition to NTDs (Mutations etc.), it can lead to the occurrence of NTDs
- Folic acid needs to be taken in the first 2 weeks after missed menstrual period (weeks 3 and 4 of pregnancy) to prevent NTDs as neural tube closes at end of 4th week.
- What can be done to Manage/Treat NTDs:
1. Treat handicapped child with the NTD 
2. Prenatal diagnosis and abortion upon subsequent pregnancy (Main outcome)
3. Genetic diagnosis and counselling (Not possible at the moment)
4. Treat embryo to prevent the defects occurring

### Current Recommendations

- UK = Folic acid 400 𝜇g/0.4mg for all women in peri-conceptional period (before they are trying to conceive and during early weeks of pregnancy) or Folic acid 4-5 mg for women at high risk of NTD (Previously affected pregnancy or FHx of NTD)
- USA = Additional 100 𝜇g for everyone via food-fortification (Addition of Folate to everyday food).
- Despite Folate Supplementation, NTDs are still relatively frequent
- Food Fortification with Folate has been rejected in UK (Voluntary Supplementation is used) because it will cause too many twin births.
- Pregnancy often starts with twins, with 1 of them dying, and this is prevented by folate.
- ↑ folate will also ↑ risk of cancer and will hide early stages of anaemia in elderly.
- Voluntary Supplementation with Folate (As is seen in UK and Wider Europe) does not lead to a reduction in overall NTD frequency whereas Food Fortification (as in the USA) can reduce the prevalence of NTDs

### NTD Resistance

- 70% of NTDs are folate responsive (Splotch, Cart1, Cited2), 30% are folate resistant/non-responsive (curly tail, axial defects, EphrinA5).

### PONTI Trial (Prevention of Neural Tube Defects by Inositol)

- Inositol (Myo-Inositol or D-Chiro-Inositol) is suggested as a treatment for folate resistant recurring
NTDs. This is an important component of cell membranes and as a secondary Messenger in the form of IP3)
