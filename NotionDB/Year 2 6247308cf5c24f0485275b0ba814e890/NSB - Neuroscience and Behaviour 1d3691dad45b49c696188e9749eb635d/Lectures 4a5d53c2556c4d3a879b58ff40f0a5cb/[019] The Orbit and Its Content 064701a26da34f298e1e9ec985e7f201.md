# [019] The Orbit and Its Content

# Bony Elements of The Orbit

- A large number of cranial bones participate in the formation of the orbit:
1. Orbital Process of the Frontal bone - Forms  roof of the Orbit
2. Zygomatic bone - Forms the Lateral Margin, Lateral aspect of the floor of the Orbit and the lateral half of the Inferior Margin of the Orbit
3. Maxilla - Forms the medial half of the inferior margin of the Orbit and the Inferomedial half of the Floor of the Orbit
4. Lacrimal bone - Forms the Medial Margin of the Orbit
5. Ethmoid bone - Found Posterolateral to the Lacrimal Bone, just medial to the Superior Orbital Fissure and superior to the Maxilla, forming the Superomedial Aspect of the Orbital Floor
6. Greater Wing of the Sphenoid - Forms the Lateral aspect of the Floor of the Orbit (Posterolateral aspect of Orbit)
- The Frontal Bone forms the anterior curvature of the Cranial Vault before sharply curving posteriorly at the Supraorbital Margin to form the roof of the Orbit

# Sphenoid Bone

- Superior Orbital Fissure is found between the Greater and Lesser Wings of the Sphenoid
- Optic Foramen/Canal is found in the Base of the Lesser Wings
- Foramen Rotundum and Ovale do not have outlets into the Orbit from the Intracranial Region
- Optic Canal = Outlet for Neurovascular Structures (Optic Nerve, Opthalmic Artery) that enter the Orbit and supply the Eye
- The Greater Wings of the Sphenoid are Concave Anteriorly to help contribute to the shape of the Middle Cranial Fossa
- Anterior and Poserior Clinoid Processes are found on the Posterior surface of the Sphenoid, just lateral to the Sella Turcica, and is where the Tectorium Cerebelli attaches
- The Pituitary Gland is found in the Sella Turtica, between the Dorsum Sellae inferiorly and Tuberculum Sellae superiorly
- The Cavernous Sinus is found on the Posterior Surface of the Sphenoid Bone, just lateral to the Sella Turcica, between the Sella Turcica and the Temporal Bone

# Ethmoid Bone

- It is found centrally in the Anterior Cranial Fossa but only the Crista Galli is visible on the surface of the ACF
- Lateral to the Crista Galli on either side of it are the Cribriform Plates
- Most of the Body of the Ethmoid Bone is found deep/posterior to the Crista Galli and hence, is not visible in the ACF
- However, the Orbital Surface of the Ethmoid Bone (The Curved Lateral Wall of the Orbit) can be seen forming the medial wall of the Orbit
- This part of the ethmoid contains air cells (hollow air spaces within the bone) and the walls are paper thin and so, are easily damaged
- Air Cells are lined with Mucous Membrane
- The Crista Galli is the attachment site of the Falx Cerebri

# Position of the Eye in the Orbit

- The Medial orbital wall lies parallel to the midsagittal plane
- The lateral wall of the orbit is angled with regards to the midsagittal plane (oblique) so that the Orbit is funnel/cone shaped
- The orbital axis and visual axis of the eye (midsagittal planes through the Orbit and Eye) do not overlap â€“ this has consequences on how the extraocular eye muscles work

![Screenshot 2021-10-31 at 20.28.01.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Orbit%20and%20Its%20Content%20064701a26da34f298e1e9ec985e7f201/Screenshot_2021-10-31_at_20.28.01.png)

# Zygomatic Fractures

- In the flat human face, the zygomatic and maxilla bones of the cheek and nose are the most anterior facing/protruding structures, which therefore are often the first points of contact in traumatic injuries
- Zygomatic Fractures disrupt the contour of the inferior margin and floor of the orbit
- This can cause the Suspensory Ligament of the eye in the horizontal plane become loose or rupture.
- Extraocular eye muscles can also become obstructed or trapped in the fracture fragments and thus restricted in their movements
- Common symptom is double vision (diplopia) - This is because as the Suspensory Ligament of the Eye attaches to the Zygomatic bone medially, Zygomatic Fractures means this attachment of the Suspensory Ligament is no longer fixed to the Orbit, meaning the eye is no longer fixed in its position within the horizontal plane in the orbit
- Diplopia can also arise as the fractured bone directly obstructs the movements of the rectus muscles on that one side whilst the rectus muscles are unaffected on the contralateral side, meaning the rectus muscles produce varying amount of movement with the same level of motor stimulation (eye movements are not coordinated and of the same magnitude)

![Screenshot 2021-10-31 at 20.29.10.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Orbit%20and%20Its%20Content%20064701a26da34f298e1e9ec985e7f201/Screenshot_2021-10-31_at_20.29.10.png)

# Blow Out Fractures of the Orbit

- The maxillary and ethmoidal bones contributing to the orbit are paper thin and therefore, fractures of the medial and inferior walls of the orbit (mainly inferomedial fractures are therefore common)
- The Maxilla is so thin here due to the presence of the Maxillary Air Sinuses just deep to this region
- Mostly when the orbit and/or the eye are directly submitted to a posteriorly directed blunt force, causing the eyeball and orbital contents to be compressed against the posteromedial wall/floor of the Orbit, causing it to 'blow out'
- This commonly causes the Orbit to open into one of the Air Sinuses of the face, into which blood can collect
- Common symptoms are double vision (as eyes are not level), sunken eyeball (eyeball found deeper in the orbit), eyes are not level/ptosis (in different transverse planes), loss of sensation of the cheek and maxillary gums due to infraorbital nerve injury as it passes through the Infraorbital Foramen (Arises from CN V2)

---

# Extraocular Eye Muscles

- The eyeball is surrounded by a Fascial Sheath in which it rotates. It separates it from the Orbital Muscles and fat
- The Cornea is much more curved than the globe
- The Fascial Sheath is deficient anteriorly in front of the Cornea but posteriorly, it fuses with the Dura of the Optic Nerve
- The Extraocular Muscles have to pierce the fascial sheath before it can insert onto the Sclera near the equator of the Eye.
- After the Extraocular Muscles pierce the Fascial Sheath, it surrounds the muscle
- The Fascial Sleeves of the Medial and Lateral Rectus are attached to the Orbital walls by Check Ligaments (small transverse fascial Sleeves/extensions)
- These help to stabilise the eye in the orbit and resist compression of the globe of the Eye by the Extraocular Muscles
- The Suspensory Ligament is a hammock-shaped band that stretches between the Lacrimal Bone medially and the Zygomatic Bone laterally, under the eye, and attaches to the Fascial Sheath on the Inferior Surface of the Eyeball and the Fascial Sheath surrounding the Inferior Extraocular Muscles
- This holds the eye in its horizontal plane within the orbit

![Business Card on 5 Nov 2021 at 5_36_17 pm.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Orbit%20and%20Its%20Content%20064701a26da34f298e1e9ec985e7f201/Business_Card_on_5_Nov_2021_at_5_36_17_pm.png)

- At the back of the orbit, a tendinous ring serves as common origin for the rectus muscles (not the oblique muscles).
- It is found on the Orbital Apex on the Floor/Posterior Wall of the Orbit
- It surrounds the Optic Foramen (End of the Optic Canal) and Medial Aspect of the Superior Orbital Fissure to act as an entrance point for structures which enter the orbit through these openings
- All 4 rectus (straight) muscles of the eye insert slightly anterior to the coronal equator of the eye (coronal plane that divides the eye into an anterior and medial half), and are arranged surrounding the eye.
- The Oblique muscles originate originate from the orbit surrounding the Tendinous Ring
- These are the Lateral, Medial, Superior and Inferior Rectus, labelled by what region of the Eyeball they insert on and their spacial relation to the Eyeball
- As these muscles pass anteriorly from their origins, they form a muscular cone surrounding the eye
- IO Originates on the floor of the Maxilla in the Anterior Aspect of the Orbital Floor and inserts on the Lateral Aspect of the Eyeball, just inferior to the Lateral Rectus
- SO originates from the Medial wall of the Orbit (Lesser Wing of the Sphenoid, medial to the Optic Canal and posterior to the Tendinous Ring) and then runs anteriorly along the medial wall of the Orbit, following the medial border of Superior Rectus to reach the Trochlea.
- It then bends laterally, through the Trochlea (Tendinous sling found on the Superior Aspect of the Medial Orbital Wall) and runs posterolaterally to insert on the Superior Aspect of the Eyeball, just posterior to the Insertion of Superior Rectus
- The superior and inferior oblique muscles insert behind/posterior to the coronal equator
- The Levator Palpebrae is found posterior to the Superior Rectus, originating from the bony orbit superior to the Origin of Superior Rectus and passes anteriorly to insert into the Upper Eyelid
- It lifts the upper eyelid

# Extraocular Muscle Innervation

- Oculomotor nerve (III) innervates all extraocular eye muscles and the levator palpebrae.
- There is an inferior division to the Inferior Rectus, Medial Rectus and Inferior Oblique and a superior one to Superior Rectus and Levator Palpebrae.
- The exception from this are:
1. Trochlear nerve (IV): Superior Oblique muscle, exclusively
2. Abducens nerve (VI) Lateral Rectus muscle, exclusively
- Most eye movements require a mix of these muscles and innervation to closely work
together
- The Medial Rectus is stronger than the combined strength of the other Rectus Muscles
- Remember LRâ‚†(SOâ‚„)â‚ƒ:
- LR = CN VI
- SO = CN IV
- Rest = CN III

# Movements of the Eye and the Extraocular Muscles

- Medial Rectus = Eye Adduction (Medial Rotation of the Eye in the Transverse Plane/Around a Sagittal Axis)
- Lateral Rectus = Eye Abduction (Lateral Rotation of the Eye in the Transverse Plane/Around a Sagittal Axis)
- The Visual Axis lies in the sagittal plane (parallel to the Medial Wall) whilst the Orbital Axis and the axis in which the Superior and Inferior Recti run lie in an oblique plane (Parallel to the Lateral Wall)
- This means that when the eye is turned laterally/abducted, the Visual and Orbital Axis line up so the Superior and inferior Recti can powerful elevate or depress the eye, moving the cornea superiorly and inferiorly respectively

![Business Card on 5 Nov 2021 at 6_13_48 pm.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Orbit%20and%20Its%20Content%20064701a26da34f298e1e9ec985e7f201/Business_Card_on_5_Nov_2021_at_6_13_48_pm.png)

- When the Eye looks medially, the Superior and Inferior Recti, the Visual Axis is not in line with the Orbital Axis, meaning the Superior and Inferior Recti cannot elevate/depress the eye but tend to rotate the eye medially and laterally respectively around an Transverse axis AKA Torsion (Cornea remains in same position)
- When the Eye is looking medially, the Superior and Inferior Obliques become the main Depressors and Elevators of the Eye respectively as they lie in the same plane as the Visual Axis in this position (Opposite to Superior and Inferior Recti as these muscles insert behind the Equator of the Eye whereas the Recti insert anterior to the Equator)
- The Effects of the Oblique muscles on Eye Elevation/Depression is most significant when the eye is looking medially
- When the eye is pointing laterally, the Superior and Inferior Obliques primarily produce Medial and Lateral Torsion of the Eye around a Transverse Axis
    
    ![Business Card on 5 Nov 2021 at 6_13_48 pm.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Orbit%20and%20Its%20Content%20064701a26da34f298e1e9ec985e7f201/Business_Card_on_5_Nov_2021_at_6_13_48_pm%201.png)
    
- Superior Oblique = Turns the Eye towards the nose in the Coronal Plane and rotating the eye inferomedially towards the nose
- Inferior Oblique = Turns the eye away from the nose in the Coronal Plane and rotates the eye superolaterally away from the nose
- When these muscles work together, and depending on the initial position of the eye, these muscles can have different functions in order to restore the neutral gaze of the eyeball (Eye facing anteriorly)
- Superior Rectus Muscle can move the Eye medially towards the Nose, notably when the eye is Abducted, to restore the neutral gaze
- Inferior Rectus can move the eye medially towards the Nose, notably when the eye is Abducted/looking laterally, to restore the neutral gaze
- Medial and Lateral Rectus lack secondary functions, acting primarily as Adductors and Abductors of the Eye respectively
- Inferior and Inferior Obliques can slightly move the eyeball laterally (either superolaterally or inferolaterally) depending on the position of the Eyeball
- Testing Medial and Lateral Recti = Look medially (towards nose) from Neutral Gaze and then back to Neutral Gaze
- Testing Superior + Inferior Recti and Obliques= From Neutral Position, look up and then down
- Testing Superior and Inferior Recti = From a Laterally directed position, look up and then down (Obliques cannot elevate/depress the eye in this position but produce torsion)
- Testing Superior and Inferior Obliques = From a Medially directed position, look up and then down (Recti cannot elevate/depress the eye in this position but produce torsion)
- Keeping the eyes parallel and coordinated in their movements (preventing strabsimus) requires fine control of the extraocular muscles, notably for the constant corrections for torsional movements produced by the extraocular muscles

# Lateral Eye Position and the Alignment of the Superior and Inferior Rectus Muscles

- When the Eye is in Neutral Position within the Orbit, the Visual Axis is parallel to the Axis of the Medial Wall of the Orbit (Runs in the Sagittal Plane) rather than the Midorbital Plane that passes obliquely between the Medial and Lateral Walls of the Orbit
- When the Eye is in the Lateral Gaze, the Superior Rectus is found parallel to the Orbital Axis and Visual Axis
- This means that in this Lateral Position, Contraction of the SR or IR would cause slight adduction and more pronounced elevation/depression of the eye respectively

# Diagnostic Gaze Positions

- Ask the Px to look from the Neutral Gaze into different gaze positions
- If the Px is unable to assume certain gaze positions, this can indicate damage to the Extraocular Muscles (E.g due to Fracture) or the Nerves supplying them (Neural Lesion)

![Screenshot 2021-10-31 at 20.34.05.png](%5B019%5D%20The%20Orbit%20and%20Its%20Content%20064701a26da34f298e1e9ec985e7f201/Screenshot_2021-10-31_at_20.34.05.png)

# Course of the Neural Structures in the Orbit

- Neurovascular Structures entering/leaving the Orbit pass through the Optic Foramen or Superior Orbital Fissure
- Structures passing through the Optic Foramen and the Medial Region of the Superior Orbital Fissure enter the orbit within the muscular cone of the Rectus Muscles
- Structures passing through the Lateral Region of the Superior Orbital Fissure enter the orbit lateral to the Muscular Cone of the Rectus Muscles
- The Ophthalmic Division of the Trigeminal Nerve (CN V1) and its branches are purely sensory

### Lateral to the Muscular Cone

- These are found just deep to the Periosteum of the Orbit
1. The Lacrimal Nerve is the most superior/superficial and Lateral Nerve found within the Orbit, running along the Lateral border of the Eye
- This carries afferents from the Conjunctiva and Eyelids
1. The Frontal Nerve is larger than and found medial to the Lacrimal Nerve, running anteromedially over the Superior surface of the Superior Rectus 
- This bifurcates into the Supraorbital and Supratrochlear Nerves just posterior to the Eyeball and these carry afferents from the Medial side of the Eye, extending superiorly to the top of the Scalp
1. Trochlear nerve (IV) enters the Orbit laterally via the lateral aspect of the Superior Orbital Fissure and moves medially to run on the superior surface of the superior oblique muscle and innervate it

![f008-104-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B019%5D%20The%20Orbit%20and%20Its%20Content%20064701a26da34f298e1e9ec985e7f201/f008-104-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Within the Muscular Cone

- These enter the Orbit via the medial aspect of the superior orbital fissure or Optic Foramen and run through the centre of the Tendinous Ring:
1. Optic nerve (II) via the optic foramen (found superomedial to the Superior Orbital Fissure) and tendinous ring
- The Optic Nerve is held in place/anchored within the Optic Foramen by the Superior Aspect of the Muscular Cone/Tendinous Ring
1. Oculomotor nerve (III) - This enters the Orbit via the Superior Orbital Fissure splits into superior and inferior divisions, with the Nasociliary Branch of the Ophthalmic Division of the Trigeminal Nerve and the Abducens Nerve found between these divisions medially and laterally
- Preganglionic PSNS Fibres run in the Oculomotor Nerve and leave the nerve to synapse with Postganglionic PSNS Fibres in the Ciliary Ganglion that continue down the Short Ciliary Nerves to innervate the Sphincter Pupillae and Ciliary Muscle to lead to narrowing of the Pupil and Accommodation respectively
- Ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1) runs medially via the superior orbital fissure.
1. Abducens (VI) - This is in the inferomedial aspect of the Superior Orbital Fissure, close to the Inferior Margin of the Tendinous Ring

![f008-101-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B019%5D%20The%20Orbit%20and%20Its%20Content%20064701a26da34f298e1e9ec985e7f201/f008-101-9780323393041.jpeg)

Important branches of the Ophthalmic Nerve (CN V1):

1. The Nasociliary nerve (entirely sensory)
- The Nasociliary Nerve crosses over the superior surface of the optic nerve towards the medial wall of the Orbit.
- As it approaches the medial wall, it divides into branches that carry sensation from the surface and bridge of the nose and from the air sinuses in the Ethmoid bone.
1. The long and short ciliary nerves of the eyeball - These arise from the Nasociliary Nerve
- The Long Ciliary Nerves are sensory from the Eyeball but also carry SNS Fibres to the Dilator Pupillae to cause the pupil to dilate.
- Some sensory Neurons of the Nasociliary Nerve and SNS Neurons travel through the Ciliary Ganglion (PSNS Ganglion) without synapsing here, reaching the eye via Short Ciliary Nerves
- The Short Ciliary Nerves and Ciliary Ganglion are found lateral to the Long Ciliary Nerves
- As Sensory Fibres from the Short CIliary Nerves pass through the Ganglion without synapsing to join the Nasociliary Nerve more proximally, the Ciliary Ganglion appears to be suspended from the Nasociliary Nerve, just lateral to the Optic Nerve
- The Divisions of the Oculomotor Nerve split within the Superior Orbital Fissure and follow the Recti and Levator Palpebrae which they innervate

# Arterial Blood Supply to the Orbit

- Blood supply to the orbit is through the ophthalmic artery, a branch of the internal carotid artery after it leaves the Cavernous Sinus
- It reaches the orbit via the Optic Foramen and travelling inferomedially to the Optic Nerve through the optic canal
- As it runs anteriorly, it spirals around the Lateral margin of the Optic Nerve
- When it emerges into the Orbit, it gives off the central retinal artery (most important branch), which runs deep/inferior to the Optic Nerve and passes into its substance to enter the eyeball and supply it alongside the Optic Nerve at the Optic Disc
- As the Central Artery of the Retina is the only blood supply to the Retina, blockage of this artery leads to complete blindness
- At the distal end of the Optic Nerve (before it enters the Eyeball), it gives off the short and long ciliary arteries
- Just as the Ophthalmic Artery crosses the Superior Surface of the Optic Nerve to run medially, it gives off the Lacrimal Artery (lateral branch) which runs with the lateral rectus, towards the lacrimal gland, eyelids and conjunctiva to supply these structures
- As the Ophthalmic Artery runs anteriorly along the Medial wall of the Orbit, it gives off the Anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries (rather large branches) which supply the Medial Wall of the Orbit and surrounding structures but also the Mucosa of the Ethmoidal Air Cells/Sinuses by piercing the Orbital Surface of the Ethmoid Bone
- These accompany the Anterior and Posterior Ethmoidal Nerves (Branches of Nasociliary Nerve), out through the medial wall of the Orbit
- Supra-orbital artery - This relatively large artery arises from the Ophthalmic Artery distal to the Origin of the Lacrimal Artery but proximal to the Origin of the Ethmoidal Arteries. It runs superolaterally, across the superior surface of the Eyeball to supply both the medial aspect of the orbit and ethmoid
- At the Anteromedial most Aspect of the Orbit, the Ophthalmic Artery bifurcates to give the Supratrochlear Artery (Medial) and the Dorsal Nasal Artery (Lateral)
- The Dorsal Nasal Artery runs anteriorly out of the orbit to supply the Dorsum of the Nose (Nasal Bridge)

![f008-099-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B019%5D%20The%20Orbit%20and%20Its%20Content%20064701a26da34f298e1e9ec985e7f201/f008-099-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Venous Drainage of the Orbit

- Most of the venous drainage of the orbit is via the Superior Ophthalmic Vein towards the cavernous sinus
- Veins from the forehead and face can drain via the orbit as well, into the Cavernous Sinus or the Pterygoid Plexus, which drains directly into the Sigmoid Sinus
- This presents a potential risk to track infections of the forehead, nose and posterior mouth via the Facial Vein to the cavernous sinus and into the Intracranial Region and vice versa as these orbital veins lack valves

# Applied Anatomy of the Eye and the Orbit (D&P Only)

### Foreign Bodies

- They are often found under the upper eyelid in the superior fornix
- Sometimes, they can injure the cornea and can cause corneal abrasion
- Sometimes infections like Conjunctivitis can ulcerate the cornea and cause deeper infections of the iris (Iridocyclitis)

### Squint/Strabismus

- Deviation of the eyes such that their visual axes are no longer parallel with each other
- The only time in non-pathological states that the visual axes of the eye are non-parallel is during the normal convergence that occurs when the eyes focus on very close objects
- Squint can be caused by a lesion of one of the CNs that supplies the Extraocular Muscles (CN III, IV or VI) or can be due to a localised issue within the muscle
- When the eyes tend to look towards each other, the squint is convergent and when the eyes tend to look away from one another, the squint is said to be divergent

### Cranial Nerve Palsies

**CN III Palsy:**

- In CN III Palsy, there is:
1. Unopposed SNS Action on Dilator Pupillae (as PSNS Oculomotor Fibres are Damaged), causing Mydriasis
2. Accomodation from Far to Close vision is impossible (as PSNS Oculomotor Fibres are damaged)
3. Upper Eyelid is closed as Levator Palpebrae Superioris loses its voluntary innervation so the eyelid cannot be raised (SNS Fibres from CN III That innervate Levator Palpebrae Superioris are unable to raise the eyelid on their own)
4. The eye is abducted due to unopposed action of Lateral Rectus (The Eye may also be intorted as when the Eye is Abducted/looking laterally, the Superior Oblique cannot depress the eye, only intort it)
- Many CN III Lesions are only partial and hence, may be more difficult to Dx than a complete CN III Lesion

**CN VI Palsy:**

- Inability to abduct the eye towards the side of the lesion due to Lateral Rectus paralysis
- Attempts to do this lead to Diplopia as the unaffected eye abducts but the affected eye remains centrally placed

**CN IV Palsy:**

- They are rare on their own and are usually identified as the Px complains that they are unable to look Inferomedially towards their nose (Making it difficult to perform tasks like going down the stairs)
- With the eye placed medially (often due to unopposed action of Medial Rectus due to Lateral Rectus paralysis), the Superior Oblique muscle is normally able to perfectly depress the eyeball (**This is not possible in a CN IV Lesion due to Superior Oblique Paralysis**)

### Horner's Syndrome

- Occurs when there is disruption of the Sympathetic Trunk (E.g Lung Tumour like Pancoast Tumour that invades the Sympathetic Trunk in the Thorax or at the Neck of Rib 1 or potentially due to poorly placed anaesthesia)
- This leads to unopposed PSNS Activity on the side of the lesion, leading to:
1. Miosis
2. Hot Flushed Dry Face on the Ipsilateral side as the Lesion
3. Ptosis (Due to loss of SNS Innervation to Levator Palpebrae Superioris and raising the eyelid requires the action of Voluntary and Involuntary Fibres innervating Levator Palpebrae Superioris)
