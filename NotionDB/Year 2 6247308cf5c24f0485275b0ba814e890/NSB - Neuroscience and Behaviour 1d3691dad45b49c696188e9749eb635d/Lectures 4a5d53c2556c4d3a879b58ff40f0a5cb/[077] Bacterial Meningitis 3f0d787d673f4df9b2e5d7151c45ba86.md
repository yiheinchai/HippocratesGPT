# Meningitis Pathogens

### Children and Adults

- Main pathogens = SMILE - **S**treptococcus pneumonia, Neisseria **M**eningitidis, Haemophilus **I**nfluenza Type b, **L**isteria monocytogenes, ****Mycobacterium ****(**E**xtrapulmonary) tuberculosis.
- Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus)
- Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)
- Haemophilus influenza type B
- Listeria monocytogenes - Common in Pregnancy, Young, Old,  Immunocompromised and Alcoholics.
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis - HIV. Immunocompromised.
- Staphylococcus aureus and G -ve Rods - Can arise iatrogenically from Neurosurgery/trauma..

### Neonates

- Main pathogens = GEL - **G**roup B Streptococcus, **E**. coli, **L**isteria
monocytogenes.

# Meningococcal Meningitis (Neisseria Menngitidis)

- Common cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia in the UK and
Ireland.
- 2,000 people in the UK and Ireland every year.
- Babies and children under the age of 5 are at the highest risk, but there is a secondary peak of disease amongst teenagers.
- Several different groups of meningococcal bacteria cause disease.
- Most common are meningococcal A, B, C, W and Y.
- In the UK and Ireland, meningococcal vaccines are routinely available
that protect against all 5 of the most common disease causing strains.
- 5-10% have Neisseria meningitidis as a commensal in our nasopharynx
- Transmitted through prolonged close contact (Aerosol): coughing, sneezing, breathing each other's breath or by kissing someone who is carrying
the germ.
- Bacteria break through the protective lining of the nose and throat, and enter the bloodstream.
- Once in the bloodstream, they multiply rapidly, doubling their numbers every 30 minutes.
- Meningitis vs Sepsis - In some people the bacteria cross the BBB, causing meningitis. In others, overwhelming septicaemia happens so quickly due to rapid replication that there is no time for meningitis to develop
- Meningococcal Sepsis is characterised by a Non-Blanching Petechiae (or sometimes Purpura) and Subconjunctival Haemorrhage

# Guidelines

### British Infection Association

- Early Recognition of Sx is vital
- After doing ABCDE Initial Assessment, if Meningitis is suspected, take Blood Cultures and Lumbar Puncture
- Consider giving Dexomethosone and Antibiotics (Ideally after Lumbar Puncture to prevent death of Pathogen in CSF Sample that would make Culturing/Identification of the Pathogen more difficult)

# Pneumococcal Meningitis

- Common cause of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia worldwide.
- Most cases of pneumococcal meningitis are in children <2 yrs old, adults > 65 yrs and in those with medical problems that put them at increased risk of disease.
- Pneumococcal meningitis can be severe  and has a higher risk of death and long term brain damage than most other causes of bacterial meningitis.

### Diagnosis of Meningitis

- Clinical = Sx
- Laboratory = Blood Tests and CSF (Via Lumbar Puncture) - CSF looks Cloudy

### Laboratory Diagnosis

1. CSF
- Opening Pressure
- Appearance
- Cell Count
- Biochemistry (Glucose and Protein)
- Gram Stain and Culture
1. Blood:
- Culture
- PCR
1. Throat Swab (Presence of Pathogen in Oropharynx)

# Microscopy

### Neisseria Meningitidis

- Gram -ve diplococci (Neiserria meningitidis) found intracellularly within Neutrophils.

### Streptococcus Pneumoniae

- Gram Positive Diplococci found extracellularly

### Haemophilus Influenza

- Gram -ve rod

### Group B Streptoccus

- Gram Positive Cocci in chains

# CSF Profiles

- Bacterial and Tuberculosis Meningitis have a raised protein and low glucose

| Meningitis | Neutrophils | Glucose | Protein |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bacterial | ↑ | ↓ | ↑ |
| Viral (CSF Clear) | ↑ | Normal | Normal or ↑↑ |
| Tuberculosis | ↑ | ↓ | ↑ |
| Cryptococcal | Normal | Normal | Normal |

# Treatment

### GP

- Suspected meningococcal infection = Benzylpenicillin intra-muscular

### Hospital

- Empirical (Before Antibiotic Sensitivity is known) = 3rd generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone)
- If Listeria Meningitis is suspected due to risk factors (>55, Alcoholic, Pregnant or Immuncompromised), also give Amoxicillin or Ampicillin

### Targetted - Once Antibiotic Sensitivity is Known

- Benzylpenicillin for S. pneumoniae (if sensitive)
- 3rd generation cephalosporin continued for H. influenzae, known or suspected penicillin
resistant S. pneumoniae or N. meningitidis

---

# Prevention

- Notification to PHE as disease is notifiable.
- Prophylaxis: close household/’kissing’ contacts for meningococcus or H. influenzae Meningitis.
- Antibiotic prophylaxis (Usually Rifampacin or Ciprofloxacin depending on causative agent)
- Vaccination

### Vaccines

- MMR vaccine
- Hib vaccine: conjugate
- Meningococcal vaccine:
- Polysaccharide: A/C, A/C/Y/W 135
- Conjugate: B, C
- Pneumococcal vaccines:
- Polysaccharide: 23-valent for Elderly
- Conjugate: 13-valent in Young since 2010
