# [008] Anatomy and Relations of the Pharynx

# Location of the Pharynx

- The Pharynx is a mixed soft tissue space of the Upper Airways and Digestive Tract, comprised of a muscular tube with a mucosal inner lining (No bones are found in the pharynx)
- The Pharynx is located posterior to the nose (nasopharynx), mouth (oropharynx) and the larynx (laryngopharynx), superior to the Oesophagus, Inferior to the Cranial Base and anterior to the Vertebral Column

# Constrictors of the Pharynx (D&P)

### Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor

- the Pharynx is a muscular tube that begins with the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor whose superior muscle fibres arise from the posterior aspect of the nose bilaterally (from the Medial Pterygoid Plates of the Sphenoid)
- The Inferior-most tip of each Medial Pterygoid Plate curves posteriorly to form a hook-like projection (Pterygoid Hamulus)
- The Muscular Fibres arising either side of the Medial Pterygoid Plates run posteriorly and sweep up to the Midline Posteriorly to attach to Pharyngeal Tubercle of the Basilar Part of the Occipital Bone
- This forms a muscular tube, which forms part of the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor, the upper part of which bounds the Nasopharynx Posteriorly
- In the Midline of the Posterior Pharynx, there is a seam or raphé that runs down its entire length that runs from the Pharyngeal Tubercle of the Occipital Bone to the Proximal Aspect of the Posterior Oesophagus.
- This is where the Pharyngeal Constrictors from each side fuse with each other in the midline
- Muscle Fibres from the Superior Constrictor also arise lower down from the sides of the Mouth just below the Medial Pterygoid Plate, from the Pterygomandibular Raphé, a Vertical Raphé which extends from the Pterygoid Hamulus superiorly to the Inner Surface of the Mandible inferiorly
- These Inferior Muscle Fibres of the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor also sweep posteriorly to fuse together at the Posterior Midline Raphé of the Pharynx
- This lower region of the Superior Constrictor Muscle encircles the Oropharynx at the Posterior Region of the Oral Cavity
- The Palatine Tonsils are found embedded to the Inner Lateral Walls of the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor

### Middle Pharyngeal Constrictor

- This originates from the Greater Horn of the Hyoid Bone and the Stylohyoid Ligament
- These fibres run posteriorly to the back of the Pharynx, superficial to the Inferior Fibres of the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor, to fuse with the Posterior Midline Raphé

![f008-202-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-202-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Inferior Pharyngeal Constrictor

- This originates from the Lateral Sides of the Thyroid and Cricoid Cartilages
- These fibres run posteriorly, superficial to the Fibres of the Middle Pharyngeal Constrictor, to insert onto the Posterior Midline Raphé

![f008-202-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-202-9780323393041.jpeg)

- The Overlap of the Superior, Middle and Inferior Pharyngeal Constrictors means that the Posterior Midline Raphé is continuous down the length of the Pharynx

![Scannable Document on 9 Nov 2021 at 3_11_33 pm 2.png](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/Scannable_Document_on_9_Nov_2021_at_3_11_33_pm_2.png)

# Fascia and Membranes of the Pharynx (D&P)

- The Laryngopharynx is continuous with the Oesophagus inferiorly (below the Inferior Pharyngeal Constrictor)
- Behind the Laryngopharynx and the Proximal Part of the Oesophagus, Prevertebral Fascia is found, which covers the Prevertebral Muscle Mass
- This is well-defined here and allows the free movement of the Pharynx and Oesophagus independent of the movement of the Prevertebral Muscles
- Between the Prevertebral Fascia posteriorly and the Pharynx anteriorly, there is a potential space (Retropharyngeal Space), which is normally filled with Connective Tissue
- Infection in this space can spread rapidly and any pus forming here can form a Retropharyngeal Abcess

![f008-163-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-163-9780323393041.jpeg)

- Whilst the Larynx and Trachea found anteriorly are Cartilaginous, the Pharynx and Oesophagus found posteriorly are Muscular, this difference being due to their different functions
- There are gaps in the Pharyngeal Muscles found laterally which are filled with loose Connective Tissue through which Neurovascular Structures pass to enter the Oropharynx + Mouth and the Laryngopharynx + Larynx

![Scannable Document on 9 Nov 2021 at 3_06_14 pm.png](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/Scannable_Document_on_9_Nov_2021_at_3_06_14_pm.png)

- The Pharyngobasilar Fascia is a thin layer of fascia that covers the inner surfaces of the Pharyngeal muscles to strengthen gaps between the Muscles of the Oropharynx
- It is evident above the Level of the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor but rapidly thins moving inferiorly and does not exist in the Lower Regions of the Pharynx as a membrane as if it did, the Laryngopharynx would be unable to expand and contract alongside the Oesophagus to which it is attached inferiorly - Here, it only contributes to the Posterior Midline Raphé

![f008-202-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-202-9780323393041%201.jpeg)

- The Outer Surface of the Pharynx (and the Cheek found anterior to this) is covered by a thin layer of Epimysium called the Buccopharyngeal Membrane
- This allows easy movement of the Pharynx against the Prevertebral Fascia but is otherwise insignificant
- Therefore, the Buccopharyngeal Membrane and Pharyngobasilar Fascia surround the Outer and Inner surfaces of the Pharyngeal Muscles
- The True Membranous Pharyngobasilar Fascia fills The Gap between the Upper Border of the Superficial Pharyngeal Constrictor and the Base of the Occipital Bone
- This extends up from the Internal Surface of the Posterior Pharynx, between the Free Curved Superior Edge of the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor and the Base of the Skull

# Functions of the Pharynx

1. Passes food safely across the airway/food-way crossing (Where Trachea lies anteriorly and Oesophagus posteriorly but in close association with another) during swallowing by the Soft Palate acting as a flap valve
2. It helps directly and maximise air flow via the Oral Cavity for Maximum air flow (E.g Coughing up mucous)
3. It closes the Nasal Cavity from the Oral Cavity during Chewing and Swallowing

---

# Pharynx Topographic Anatomy

- The Muscular Tube is attached to the Pharyngeal Tubercle of the Basilar Part of the Occipital Bone, with anterior attachments (from Superior to Inferior) to the
1. Occipital Bone (Pharyngeal Tubercle - This is found just anterior to the Foramen Magnum on the Inferior Surface of the Occipital Bone)
- The Superoposterior Aspect of the Pharynx attaches to the Pharyngeal Tubercle and hangs anterolaterally to attach anteriorly to the:
1. Sphenoid (Medial Pterygoid Plates - Most extensive Pharyngeal Attachment Points)
2. Mandibular Body and Ascending Ramus (Mandibular Raphé)
- At the inferior most aspect of the Pharynx (Laryngopharynx), it is attached anteriorly to the:
1. Greater Horn of the Hyoid and the Laryngeal Cartilages (Thyroid and Cricoid Cartilage)
- It has Posterior attachments to the Pharyngeal Raphé (Midline Aponeurosis formed by the Pharyngeal Constrictors) but no attachments to the Vertebral Column as it is part of the Anterior Compartment of the Neck and must be kept mobile and functional distinct from the Posterior Compartment
- It is continuous inferiorly with the Oesophagus
- The Pharynx has 3 openings Anteriorly:
1. Posterior Nasal Cavity Opening/Choane - This is the opening of the Nasal Cavity into the Nasopharynx
2. Oral Cavity Opening - This is the opening of the Oral Cavity into the Oropharynx
3. Larynx Opening - This is the Opening of the Larynx into the Laryngopharynx

![Screenshot 2021-11-09 at 14.38.56.png](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/Screenshot_2021-11-09_at_14.38.56.png)

# Regions of the Pharynx

- The Inside of the Pharynx is lined with Epithelium
1. Nasopharynx - This is the region found Posterior to the Nasal Cavity. This is lined with Pseudostratfied Cilitated Columnar Epithelium (Respiratory Epithelium)
2. Oropharynx - This is the region that is posterior to the Oral Cavity. This is lined with Stratified Squamous Epithelium
3. Laryngopharynx - This is the lowest part of the Pharynx, found at the Level of the Larynx (which lies Anterior to this region). This is lined with Stratified Squamous Epithelium

![ds00349_-ds00756_im00110_c7_nasopharynxthu_jpg.webp](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/ds00349_-ds00756_im00110_c7_nasopharynxthu_jpg.webp)

### Nasopharynx

- This is found above the Level of the Palate and posterior by Nasal Cavity
- Its roof is formed by the Sphenoid Body and the Rostrum of the Sphenoid (Midline Triangular Projection from the Inferomedial Aspect of the Sphenoid Body)
- It contains the adenoids and the Opening of the Auditory Tube
- It is continuous inferiorly with the Oropharynx via the Narrow Pharyngeal Isthmus, formed between the Posterior Wall of the Pharynx and the Posterior Free Margin of the Soft Palate. It communicates with the Nasal Cavities anteriorly
- The Roof and Posterior Walls are covered with Mucous Membrane that covers the bones of the Skull base
- Within the Submucosa of the Posterior Wall of the Pharynx, Lymphoid Tissue is found, often aggregated together to form Adenoids
- These are often enlarged in children and if abnormally enlarged, they can force a child to breath through an open mouth- This gives the typical appearance called 'Adenoidal Facies'
- On the Lateral Wall of the Nasopharynx, at the level of the Nasal Floor, the Opening to the Auditory Tube is found
- This is bounded Superiorly and Posteriorly by a raised region of Mucosa known as the Tubal Ridge/Torus Tubarius, which also contains Lymphoid Tissue which form the Tubal Tonsil
- A fold of the Mucosal Membrane (Salpingopharyngeal Fold) can be found descending down the Lateral Wall of the Thorax from the Posterior Border of the Torus Tubaris, overlying Salpingopharyngeus
- Posterior to Torus Tubarius is the Deep Pharyngeal Recess
- It is closely associated with the Muscles of the Soft Palate

### Oropharynx

- This is found posterior to the Palatoglossal Arch/Fold (Palatoglossal Arch divides the Oral Cavity anteriorly and the Oropharynx Posteriorly)
- Its floor is formed by the Posterior Tongue and the Space between the Tongue and Epiglottis
- The Roof is formed by the Soft Palate
- It contains the Palatine Tonsils and the Valleculae
- As the Palatoglossus and Palatopharyngeus descend anteirorly and posteriorly along the Lateral Aspects of the Oral Cavity, they form the Palatoglossal and Palatopharyngeal Arches
- The Palatoglossal Arch is found anterior to the Palatopharyngeal Arch and sometimes, these two arches are known as the Anterior and Posterior Pillars of the Fauces
- The Palatopharyngeal Arch marks the Posterior Boundary of the Soft Palate
- Between these two arches, the Palatine Tonsils are found bilaterally
- The Mucous membrane on the surface of the Palatine Tonsils is invaginated deeply into the substance of the Tonsils to form narrow Tonsillar Crypts
- The Outer Surface of the Tonsil is covered by a thin capsule that is attached to the Pharyngobasilar Fascia and to the Sheath of the Palatoglossus - These attachments help to keep the Tonsil in place
- Superficial/Lateral to these muscles is the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor (which is found deep to the Facial Artery) and CN IX (Found deep/medial to the Facial Artery but superficial to the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor
- When the Tonsil is removed, it must be cut away from the Tonsilar Bed onto which it is attached medially.
- The Main Blood Supply of the Tonsil is from the Facial Artery, which enters the Inferior region of the Palatine Tonsil
- Veins that drain the Palatine Tonsil pierce the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor, near the Dorsal Lingual Artery, and drain into the Pharyngeal Venous Plexus or the Facial Veins
- These Vascular Structures can bleed badly after a Tonsillectomy

![TONSILS.webp](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/TONSILS.webp)

- Within the Nasopharynx and the Oropharynx, there is a ring of Lymphoid Tissue that surrounds the entrances to the Trachea and Oesophagus.
- This consists of the Adenoids/Pharyngeal Tonsils Posteriorly behind the Soft Palate in the Nasopharynx, Lymphoid Tissue surrounding the Opening of the Auditory Tube Laterally in the Nasopharynx, the Palatine Tonsils laterally in the Oropharynx and the Lymphoid Tissue on the Posterior Tongue within the Oropharynx, all draining to regional lymph nodes found laterally

![Scannable Document on 9 Nov 2021 at 5_56_39 pm.png](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/Scannable_Document_on_9_Nov_2021_at_5_56_39_pm.png)

### Laryngopharynx

- This is found posterior to the Larynx
- Its lateral wall is formed by the Thyroid Cartilage and the Thyrohyoid Membranes
- it contains the Piriform Fossae
- Its Posterior and Lateral Walls are formed by the Middle and Inferior Pharyngeal Constrictors, alongside the Inferior Fibres of Salpingopharyngeus, Palatopharyngeus and Stylopharyngeus
- Palatopharyngeus and Stylopharyngeus run longitudinally and internally around the Posterior and Lateral Laryngopharynx
- The Anterior Wall of the Larynopharynx is formed by the Inlet of the Larynx anteromedially and the Piriform Fossa/Recess anterolaterally
- These are depressions in the Mucous Membrane in the Mucous Membrane on each side of the Laryngeal Inlet (in the Laryngopharynx)
- Together with the Valleculae at the base of the tongue, they help to direct food and water around the Laryngeal Inlet to prevent choking/aspiration of food/water
- The Laryngopharynx is made up of the Mucous Membrane on the Posterior Surface of the Cricoid Cartilage

![f008-205-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-205-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Muscles of the Pharynx

- The pharynx muscles which help form the Muscular Tube of the Pharynx enable the pharynx to:
1. Assist the movements of the soft
palate, mainly mediated by Superior Constrictor and Palatopharyngeus
2. Constrict the diameter of the pharynx and push food boli along their way, mainly mediated by the Superior, Middle & Inferior
Pharyngeal Constrictors - This is the main function of the Pharyngeal Muscle
3. Lift the pharynx as a whole, mainly mediated by Palatopharyngeus, Stylopharyngeus
and Superior Constrictor
- The Pharyngeal Raphé runs down the Posterior Surface of the Pharynx and forms the common insertion of the Pharyngeal Constrictors

---

# Muscles of the Soft Palate

- The soft palate is the muscular flap that hangs down from the hard palate
- It is an important valve which helps to close off the posterior opening of the nasal cavity
- It thus prevents food from entering the nasal cavity
- It also directly air and food flows down the Larynx and Oesophagus respectively
- It is comprised of 5 muscles found on each side
- The Soft Palate is very mobile and moves and contracts in a complex manner when we speak and swallow

### Tensor Veli Palatini

- This originates from the Scaphoid Fossa of the Sphenoid Bone anteriorly (between the Roots of the Medial and Lateral Pterygoid Plates) and the Spine of the Scaphoid Bone posteriorly Near the Foramen Spinosum)
- This runs inferomedially from its origin, anterior to the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor and just anterior to the Auditory Tube
- The Muscle Belly of Tensor Veli Palatini converges onto a delicate tendon that Swings around the Pterygoid Hamulus/Hook of the Hamulus, using this as a bony pulley
- As a result, the muscle bends from running Inferiorly to Medially around the Pterygoid Hamulus of the Sphenoid Bone, allowing it to pass medially onto the Palate where it meets near the midline and forms the Palatine Aponeurosis on the Roof of the Mouth, at the Boundary between the Soft and Hard Palate
- It roofs the palate as the most anterior muscle of the Soft Palate
- If both ends are pulled on this tenses/flattens out the soft palate
- It is in close proximity to the pterygoid muscles of chewing

### Levator Veli Palatini

- It originates from the Petrous Temporal Bone near the Auditory Tube
- This muscle runs anteroinferiorly and medially to pierces the Pharyngobasilar Fascia to pass over the Superior Border of the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor (Through the Pharyngobasilar Fascia here) and run down its Internal Surface to insert onto the Palatine Aponeurosis
- It lifts the soft palate

### Palatine Aponeurosis

- This attaches to the posterior edge of the Hard Palate
- The Muscles of the Soft Palate insert into this tough sheet

![f008-270-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-270-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Palatoglossus

- This originates from the Underside of the Palatine Aponeurosis superiorly and descends to insert onto the Lateral Margin of the Body of the Tongue

![f008-272-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-272-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Palatopharyngeus

- This originates from the Palatine Aponeurosis and descends down the Pharynx to insert on the Laminae of the Thyroid Cartilages
- Two Slips of Palatopharyngeus surround the Levator Veli Palatini on the Superior Aspect of the Soft Palate
- This can also act as a constrictor muscle at the entrance fo the Oropharynx

![f008-270-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-270-9780323393041%202.jpeg)

### Superior Constrictor of the Pharynx

- This also determines to what extent the soft palate is depressed

![f008-270-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-270-9780323393041%203.jpeg)

### Musculus Uvulae

- This is a Midline intrinsic muscle of the Soft Palate
- It Originates form the Posterior Edge of the Hard Palate in the Midline and runs into a small tongue-like flap posteriorly called the Uvula, which hands down from the Posterior Edge of the Soft Palate
- This muscle raises a midline bulge in the Superior Surface of the Soft Palate during swallowing which acts as a bung to help close off the Nasopharynx from the Mouth during Swallowing

![f008-272-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-272-9780323393041%201.jpeg)

### Innervation

- The Motor Supply to the Pharyngeal and Muscles of the Soft Palate is provided by the Vagoaccessory Complex within the Pharyngeal Plexus and through the Laryngeal Nerves, except Tensor Veli Palatini and Stylopharyngeus
- Tensor Veli Palatini is supplied by a small branch of CN V3 that arises from the Otic Ganglion
- Stylopharyngeus is innervated by CN IX (which it is closely associated with as CN IX runs from the Jugular Foramen to the Tongue)
- Sensory Innervation to the Roof of the Nasopharynx and Nose is supplied by CN V2, with the Palatine Branches of CN V2 supplying most of the Hard and Soft Palate

![f008-276-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/f008-276-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Movement of the Muscles of the Soft Palate

1. Tensor Veli Palatini stretches/lifts the palate
2. Palatoglossus brings the palate anteroinferiorly as it attaches to the tongue
3. Levator veli palatini - This lifts the soft palate up
4. Superior constrictor lifts and sphincter closes the Soft Palate
5. Palatopharyngeus lowers the soft plate posteroinferiorly (down the Pharynx). This opens up the Pharyngeal Isthmus
- Together, these muscles can be used to either lift and tighten the soft palate, close off the nose or lower it so that air can stream freely
- There are more muscles that are responsible for lifting the soft palate to close off the Pharyngeal Isthmus than to lower the Soft Palate as lowering of the Soft Palate is supported passively by Gravity

# Blood Supply to the Pharynx

### Arteries

- As it is a deep and posterior structure of the Viscerocranium, it receives its blood supply from branches of the External Carotid Artery.
- The Branches that supply it vary according to the Pharyngeal Region:
1. Ascending Pharyngeal Artery - This is a Posterior Branch that travels between the External and Internal Carotids to supply the Posterior aspect of the Pharynx along its entire length
2. Maxillary Artery - This is a major blood supply to the Pharynx as it is one of the Largest Branches of the External Carotid Artery.
- This supplies the Nasopharynx
1. Ascending Palatine (Posterior Branch) and Tonsillar Arteries (Anterior Branch) from the Facial Artery - This supplies the Oropharynx, with the Tonsilar Artery supplying the Palatine Tonsil predominantly
2. Lingual Artery - This supplies the Laryngopharynx

### Veins

- Drainage is via similarly named veins which drain into the Pharyngeal Venous Plexus.
- This Plexus drains into the Internal Jugular Veins and sometimes, into the Retromandibular Vein and then into the Internal and External Jugular Veins

# Lymphatics of the Pharynx

- The Lymphatics which drain the Palatine Tonsils pierce the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor and go to the Nearby Lymph nodes
- The Palatine Tonsils have a rich blood supply to allow for a large volume of Immune Molecules to be delivered to these structures and for Large volumes of Lymph (potentially carrying Ag) to be produced here as the Mouth is a common and exposed entry passage into the Body
- In Tonsillitis, the Jugulodigastric/Tonsillar Node becomes particularly swollen
- The Adenoid and Tubar Tonsils mainly drain towards Retropharyngeal Nodes (Found Posterior to the Nasopharynx and Anterior to C1 and C2)
- Palatine and Lingual Tonsils (Found at the Posterior Aspect of the Tongue) drain mainly towards Submandibular, Retropharyngeal Nodes and Deep Cervical Nodes

# Innervation of the Pharynx

- The Pharyngeal Muscles are innervated by fibres from CN X, with Contributions from the Cranial Root of CN XI that enter and run within CN X
- The Mucous Membrane of the Nasopharynx receives its sensory innervation from CN V2/Maxillary Nerve (Like most of the Nose found anterior to it)
- The Mucous Membrane of the Oropharynx receives its sensory innervation from CN IX (Like the Posterior 1/3rd of the Tongue) - This is significant in the Gag Reflex
- The Mucous Membrane of the Auditory Tube, The Palatine Tonsil and the Posterior Soft Palate also receives sensory innervation from CN IX
- The Mucous Membrane of the Laryngopharynx receives its sensory innervation by the Internal and Recurrent Branches of CN X (Notably the Pharyngeal Branch of CN X and the Superior Laryngeal Nerve from CN X)

# Swallowing

- Swallowing transports a mass of chewed food (bolus) or small volume of liquid from the oral cavity to the stomach due to reflexes mediated by CN IX, X and XI
- During the Swallowing Mechanism, the Food is prevented from entering the nose and the airway and therefore, choking and food passing up into the nose (failure of the Swallowing Reflex are Sx of Bulbar Palsy - Degeneration of CN IX and X)
- The swallowing cycle can be divided into a series of muscular actions:
1. Trap the bolus in the anterior part of the oral cavity
2. Move the bolus from the mouth to the back of the mouth and entrance of the pharynx
3. Allow the bolus to enter the oesophagus while closing off the entrance to the larynx (Vocal and Vestibular Folds adducting) and nasal cavity (Soft Palate bending superiorly)
4. Transport the bolus through the oesophagus to the stomach
- During swallowing, there is a small interruption of breathing
- As a newborn, one could breathe and swallow simultaneously as the larynx was very high up in the neck
- This allows milk to travel around the inlet of the larynx without having to close the soft palate
- This allows them to breathe and breastfeed at the same time
- Around 2 years of age, this ability is lost as the neck stretches out, the larynx lowers and from then on the larynx must be closed off to prevent inhalation of food

# Phases of Swallowing

### Oral Preparatory Phase

- The lips are closed due to the action of the muscles of facial expression to prevent food falling out the mouth
- The tongue forms a trough shape to help gather the food
- Food is squeezed from the oral vestibule to the Oral Cavity Proper, between teeth due to the action of the lips and buccinator muscles
- Oral cavity is sealed posteriorly by depressing the soft palate against the back of the tongue
- This gathers food in the Posterior Region of the Oral Cavity

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 20.37.49.png](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_20.37.49.png)

### Oral Phase

- This is a voluntary phase and involves the movements of the tongue in the mouth
- The tongue is raised and pressed against the hard palate to push the bolus backward from the Tongue towards the oropharynx
- As this happens, the teeth are occluded to stabilise the Mandible so that Muscles that originate from it can act during the Pharyngeal and Oesophageal Phases
- This raising of the tongue is assisted by elevating the mandible and raising the hyoid bone which further lifts the tongue
- Soft palate is elevated to close off the nasopharynx and to direct the bolus into the oropharynx
- The Intrinsic Tongue muscles alter the shape of the Tongue, to depress it posteriorly to move the Bolus from the Back of the Mouth into the Oropharynx

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 20.38.29.png](%5B008%5D%20Anatomy%20and%20Relations%20of%20the%20Pharynx%20b5f5a5e6459e4050acdccf84e9af38ab/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_20.38.29.png)

### Pharyngeal Phase

- This is an involuntary stage
- This phase becomes active when the Bolus comes into contact with Receptors in the Mucosa on the posterior wall of the pharynx (innervated by CN IX), initiating a swallowing reflex
- The Pharynx also constricts around the Pharyngeal Isthmus between the Nasopharynx and the Oropharynx to further prevent food entry into the Nasal Cavity
- The tongue moves backwards, automatically lowering the epiglottis and forcing the bolus into the Oropharynx
- The contact between the Bolus and Posterior Wall of the Oropharynx contact initiates a sequential peristaltic contraction of the Pharyngeal Constrictors (superior → middle → inferior), mediated by CN X, which forces the bolus towards the Laryngopharynx
- As the Bolus descends down the Oropharynx to enter the Laryngopharynx, it comes into contact with the Superior Portion of the Epiglottis and folds it posteroinferiorly over the laryngeal inlet to cover it
- This closure of the Larynx is further assisted by Adduction of the Vocal Folds (Both of these actions are CN X Mediated)
- This guides the bolus either side of the Laryngeal Inlet to prevent the aspiration of food and allowing it to enter the Laryngopharynx/Oesophagus
- As the peristatic contractions of the Pharyngeal Constrictors occur, the Hyoid Bone is moved anteriorly and then superiorly, quickly following by a lifting of the Larynx by around 2 Cervical Vertebrae, pulling it towards the base of the tongue
- Respiration stops, and vestibular and vocal folds are both strongly adducted by interarytenoid muscles to prevent inhalation of food
- The inferior constrictor of the pharynx has a larger amount of muscular tissue which is sometimes called the cricopharyngeus muscle

### Oesophageal Phase

- Contractions of the cricopharyngeal (lowest part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor) forces the Bolus down (out of the Laryngopharynx) and initiates passage of the bolus through the Cricopharyngeal Sphincter into the oesophagus by initiating a peristaltic wave which propagates down the Oesophageal Muscle
- A wave of contractions of the circular muscle of the Oesophagus passes down the oesophagus, coordinated by the vagal nuclei in the brainstem

# Applied Anatomy of the Pharynx (D&P)

### Tonsillectomy

- This can obstruct the Auditory Tubes and make breathing through the Nose Difficult by blocking the Pharyngeal Isthmus
- It can also reduce the Size of the Oropharyngeal Inlet
- These factors means that tonsils easily become infected and need removing
- A Common complication of Tonsillectomies is bleeding from the Tonsilar Bed
- This is because at least 4 Large Arteries contribute to a rich Arterial Anastomosis Blood on the Surface of the Palatine Tonsil, including the Facial, Dorsal Lingual, Ascending Pharyngeal and Palatine Arteries whilst there is also extensive and copious venous drainage of the Palatine Tonsil
- Postoperative Bleeding after a Tonsillectomy can often be attributed to the External Palatine Vein that runs from the Soft Palate through the Tonsillar Bed and hence, can be damaged here once the Tonsil is separated from this bed
- CN IX also runs deep in the Tonsillar Bed as it runs anteriorly to approach the back of the tongue and hence, can also be damaged during a Tonsillectomy

### Pharyngeal Pouches/Diverticuli

- The Inferior Pharyngeal Constrictor and the Oesophagus are continuous with one another, posterior to the Cricoid Cartilage
- The Muscle Fibres in this region sometimes combine to form the Cricopharyngeus Muscle
- Sometimes, there can be inherent weakness between the Muscles of the Pharyngeal Wall and Oesophagus within this region.
- In this case, Outpouchings from the Lumen of the Pharynx are able to protrude posteriorly through the weak region between the Cricopharyngeus Muscle and the Muscle Fibres forming the Proximal Oesophagus, forming Pharyngeal Diverticula/Pouches
- These are clinically significant as food can collect within these Pouches and during a Gastroscopy, Gastroscope may pass into one rather than into the Lumen of the Oesophagus

### Cleft Lip and Palate

- These are congenital abnormalities that arise due to the incomplete fusion of the Maxillary Processes of the Mandibular Arch during development
- Clefts can be either unilateral or bilateral and may result simply from the failure of fusion of the Embryonic Processes
- One cause may be that the Maxillary processes are held apart by the Developing Tongue, which remains high if the Fetus fails to unflex/extend (As when the Foetus Unflexes, the tongue is able to drop into the mouth)
- Clefts are best described in reference to the structures that they affect
- They may only affect the Lip (Hair Lip), the Lip and Alveolar Processes of the Maxilla or even extend into the Hard and Soft Palate
- Cleft Palates can be as minor as a bifid uvula (minor consequences)
- Cleft Lips are usually fixed soon after birth
- Cleft Palates are fixed later than Cleft Lips, by freeing the Mucosa of the Palate from the Bone of the Hard Palate and bringing them together in the Midline.
- Attempts at Bony Repair (Clefts in the Hard Palate) are usually carried out later on in life
