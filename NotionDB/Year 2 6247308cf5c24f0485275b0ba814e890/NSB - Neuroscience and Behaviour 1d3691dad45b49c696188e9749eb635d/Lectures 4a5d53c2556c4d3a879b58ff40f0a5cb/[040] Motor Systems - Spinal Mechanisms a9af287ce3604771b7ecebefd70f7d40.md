# [040] Motor Systems - Spinal Mechanisms

# Organisation of the Spinal Cord

- Rexed laminations: laminar schemes of neurons in grey matter of spinal cord.
- Laminae I-IX are motor neurons whilst X is around central canal.

### **Organisation of Motor Neurons in Ventral Horn**:

- Motor neurons medially control proximal muscles.
- Motor neurons laterally control distal muscles.
- Motor neurons closest to central canal (posteriorly) control flexor muscles whilst extensor muscle motorneurons are located anteriorly.

# Motor Unit (α-Motor Neuron)

- A single motor neuron and muscle fibre that it contacts is basic unit of motor organisation (motor unit).
- In a small motor unit, a single motor neuron may contact 10-20 muscle fibres (extraocular muscles (i.e. lateral rectus)) and motor neuron will be small with high input resistance.
- In large motor units, a single motor neuron may contact more than 1,000 muscle fibres (i.e. quadriceps) and motor neuron will be large with low input resistance.
- A motor neuron and muscle fibre that it contacts is final common pathway, meaning that once a motor neuron is activated, all muscle fibres found within the Motor Unit are activated (it cannot influence fewer or more muscle fibres than it contacts).

---

# Recruitment of Motor Units

- Low levels of activation to a motor neuron pool will activate small, high resistance motor neurons of small motor units.
- Higher levels of activation will also activate larger, lower resistance motor neurons of large motor units.
- Motor units are recruited according to size principle to generate ↑
amount of tension.
- Ohm's Law (V=IR) - For any value of I, V will be higher for High R Neurons.
- The Size of the Soma determines Input Resistance (Large Soma = Low Input Resistance)
- The Depolarisation needed to trigger an action potential can be classed as V (which is a constant due to the All or Nothing Principle).
- Therefore, Small Motor Units (with Small Motor Neurons) have High Input R and therefore, Lower Synaptic Drive (I) is needed to generate an AP (V) than is required for Large Motor Units, with Large Motor Neurons that have Low Input R
- For a given Magnitude of Synaptic Drive (I), Small Motor Neurons with High Input R will produce the Largest Voltage Change (Change in Vm) and hence, are most likely to generate an AP

- As Synaptic Drive Increases, there is recruitment of successively larger motor units as well as increasing the Firing Rate of Previously activated Motor Units
- This Motor Unit Recruitment and Frequency Coding increase occurs until All Motor Units are activated and firing at their maximal rate (Tension is a function of the Number of Recruited Motor Units and their Firing Rate)

# Muscle and Joint Receptors

- Majority of signals go through interneurons.
- Brain and spinal cord need to know 2 things:
1. Tension
2. Change in muscle length
- Co-contraction: utilises both nervous control of both muscles at a joint.
- This stiffens the joint (i.e. elbow for arm wrestling, knee for walking down stairs).

# Muscle Spindle (Length)

- Detects length change of muscle
- Type 1a: respond to dynamic aspects of stretch (velocity of stretch).
- These are found around the centre of the muscle spindle
- Type 2: static (slow) change to stretch/length.
- These are found in the Lateral/Distal Aspects of the Muscle

# Stretch /Muscle Jerk/Tendon Jerk Reflex

- Not to do with function of tendon Golgi organ (detects tension).
- Tapping tendon stretches tendons lightly, stretching musclespindle.
- Stretch will have an acceleration, velocity and distance. 1a detects early dynamic movement. Type II detect later (detect more of a pushing on tendon as opposed to a quick tap).
- Considering 1a afferen**t**: largest diameter axons in PNS (myelinated) (fastest).
- Conduction velocity 50-70 ms.
- Cell bodies in dorsal root ganglion.
- Only monosynaptic reflex (fastest reflex), having an output to 𝛼 motor neurons.
- Motor output to same muscle that is stretched (tells it to contract).
- Collateral branch can innervate synergist muscle around joint (i.e. brachialis) but this is not very common.
- This signal tells the stretched muscle to contract.
- Branch to 1a inhibitory interneuron (GABAnergic).
- Supplies antagonist muscle of joint (i.e. triceps) and tells it to relax.
- The purpose of the Muscle Stretch Reflex is to stabilise limb position (maintain muscle length) despite changes in load
- As well as activating Homonymous Muscles during the Muscle Stretch Reflex, Synergist Muscles can also be activated via Collaterals to further oppose stretch but this is uncommon

# Spindles Activated in Passive Stretch and Active Contraction

### Passive Stretch

- Example: holding arm out with light load dropping into hand.
- To support at same height, must ↑ force in biceps.
- 1a afferent detects dynamic aspect of stretch. Type II holds onto static information, holding arm in same horizontal position (also to hold hand in horizontal position (hand has mass)).

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 13.08.35.png](%5B040%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Spinal%20Mechanisms%20a9af287ce3604771b7ecebefd70f7d40/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_13.08.35.png)

### Active Contraction

- Example: to do with theorised ‘spindle fibre slack’.
- During active contraction, when deliberately shortening extrafusal fibres (contraction stronger than load), spindle continues to work,
- Because it is contractile itself, they have their own motor instructions (𝛾 motor neurons) also from ventral motor horn and innervate the distal/lateral ends of the Muscle Spindle
- When an individual needs to carry out extremely fine movements, Descending Drive to γ Motor Neurons can be increased more significantly than that to α Motor Neurons
- Altering relative descending drive to α and γ Motor Neurons can be used to control the sensitivity of muscle spindles (α>γ = Low and α<γ = High) to produce fine or large movements
- This causes the Muscle Spindle to become very tense and hence, extremely sensitive to stretch (due to its high firing rate in this stretch state, small changes in muscle tension produce large relative changes in firing frequency), which allows for fine motor control
- They keep spindle (approximately) registered with extrafusal fibres.
- 𝜷-**innervation**: where fine motor control is not needed. Lower vertebrates  (i.e. amphibians) have 𝛼 and 𝛾 motor neurons as 1 that splits into both (different to humans).

- ↑ **spindle activity during muscle shortening is consistent with** 𝜶 − 𝜸 **activation**
- **Measuring EMG**: EMG begins when movement begins.
- The Motor Signal produced by the EMG is seen just before the Primary Afferent Signal is seen
- This means that motor commands (driven by α motor neurons) precede afferent signalling (Muscle Spindle Activity) via 1a Afferents that trigger α-γ Coactivation, meaning that movement is mediated by α Motor Neurons and fine tuned with γ coactivation vs γ coactivation increasing Intrafusal Fibre stretch, triggering the Muscle Stretch Reflex to produce movements via α Motor Neurons to reduce Muscle Stretch within this spindle (AKA Muscle Contraction precedes Muscle Stretch Reflex vs Muscle Stretch Reflex producing Muscle Movement)

# Interneurons and Golgi Tendon Organ

### 1a Inhibitory Interneuron

- Other Descending Motor pathways can activate 𝛼 motor neurons but can activate/inhibit 1a inhibitory interneurons.
- Activation of 1a Inhibitory Interneurons to supply Antagonist Muscles (causing Antagonist relaxation) occurs to preserve energy and put less stress on the joint (Allows Movement produced by Agonist to be maximised)
- Inhibition of 1a Inhibitory Interneurons to ensure there is Agonist-Antagonist Co-Contraction increases the Stiffness of the Joint to allow the Joint to resist changes in position/muscle length that can occur due to sudden, large changes in Load when the Muscle Stretch Reflex cannot be stimulated fast enough

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 13.13.59.png](%5B040%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Spinal%20Mechanisms%20a9af287ce3604771b7ecebefd70f7d40/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_13.13.59.png)

### Golgi Tendon Organ

- In series with extrafusal fibres. Extrafusal fibres pull on tendon organ itself (like a spring-balance).
- 1b afferent are smaller diameter than 1a.
- As tension ↑, Golgi tendon axon is compressed, sending signal.

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 13.13.50.png](%5B040%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Spinal%20Mechanisms%20a9af287ce3604771b7ecebefd70f7d40/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_13.13.50.png)

# Tendon Organ/Inverse Myotactic Reflex

- Not monosynaptic, through 1b inhibitory interneuron.
- Operates at high tensions.
- Clasp reflex: examining a patient, asking to crook their arm. Pull one arm using 2 arms. Patient resists pull, but muscle eventually
letss go.
- This is a protective mechanism to prevent damage to muscle.
- At resting and moderate muscle tension levels, the Golgi Tendon Reflex/Inverse Myotatic Reflex is active, with moderate activity in the 1b Inhibitory Interneuron (Stimulated by the 1b Afferent) to produce slight relaxation which lowers muscle tension to finely control muscle tensions. This allows the muscle contraction to produce the right tension to produce the required movements (prevents excessively large tensions from being generated which produce large inaccurate movements)
- At very high tensions, the Degree of 1b Afferent Signalling activates 1b Inhibitory Neurons to such an extend that they completely inhibit α Motor Neurons, causing complete relaxation of the Contracting Muscle Agonist (E.g Clasp Knife Reflex) in a protective mechanism to prevent muscle damage

# Convergence onto Group 1b Interneurons

- 1b Inhibitory Interneurons are strongly modulated by other spinal inputs (from local sensory receptors) and by Descending Influences from the Brain that can raise or lower tensions in the muscles produced during movements (and alter the magnitude of movements) and at rest
- Nociceptive (High Threshold) Somatosensory receptors in Joints and Skin strongly activate local 1b Inhibitory Interneurons to suppress the activity of Muscles that produce movement at the joint
- This occurs in Joints that could be damaged, especially when the joint is injured or diseased in order to demobilise painful/damaged joints to allow it to heal and minimise further damage

# Flexion and Crossed-Extension Reflex

- Example: standing on something sharp, withdraws leg and strengthens stability in other
leg.
- A𝛿 nociceptor fibres are fast, nociceptive afferents, but smaller than 1a and 1b afferents (C is slow).
- The Flexion and Crossed-Extension Reflex is a trisynaptic reflex ipsilaterally and quadrisynaptic reflex contralateral, involving an initial Excitatory Interneuron, followed by either an Inhibitory or Excitatory Interneuron depending on the Side of the Painful Stimulus
- The Aspect of the Reflex on the contralateral side contains an additional decussating excitatory interneuron
- This reflex always activates Flexors and Inhibits Extensors Ipsilaterally and the opposite for the Contralateral Side - It will never activate Extensors and Inhibit Flexors ipsilaterally as this would move the limb towards the Nociceptive stimulus which could be damaging
- Sensory event leads to a nociceptive input.
- Nociceptive afferents have a complex structure of interneurons.
- Extensor muscles is inhibited. Flexor muscles is stimulated.
- On the opposite side, opposite effect leading to extension to allow balance. This leads to knee flexion

# Renshaw Cell (Interneuron)

- α Motor Neurons supplying the Homonymous/Agonist Muscle in the Muscle Stretch Reflex gives collaterals to Renshaw Cells
- This is a spinal inhibitory interneuron that synapses on the α motor neuron that synapses on it to provide inhibitory feedback to this α motor neuron to suppress α Motor Neuron activity (prevent Hyperexcitability/Muscle contraction during the Muscle Stretch Reflex)
- The Renshaw Cell is also used to shift/distribute activity between the α motor neurons within a motor unit pool so that contraction/stimulation is maintained without needing the entire motor pool to remain active for the entire length of time that the Muscle is contracting (E.g α Motor Units in one motor pool are constantly switching between activated and inactivated to prevent Motor Neuron fatigue but maintaining a constant level of innervation to a muscle to maintain muscle tension)
- It inhibits the action of the 1a Inhibitory Interneuron to control reciprocal inhibition of the Antagonist to produce co-contraction if necessary (via Renshaw Cell Activation)
- It receives descending modulatory inhibitory and excitatory influences that modulate its action on the agonist and antagonist motorneurons
- Generally within the Spinal Cord, there is a greater inhibitory than excitatory Descending drive to motor neurons in order to tightly regulate and fine-tune motor control produced by Descending Motor Pathways
- If Descending Influences are lost (Due to Damage to the Corticospinal Tract in an UMN Lesion), it significantly contributes to the raised excitability of the α Motor Neurons due to Disinhibition of Spinal Interneurons (Inhibition of Inhibitory Interneurons controlling α Motor Neurons), producing Hyperreflexia and Increased Lower Motor Neuron activity, seen in UMN Lesions
