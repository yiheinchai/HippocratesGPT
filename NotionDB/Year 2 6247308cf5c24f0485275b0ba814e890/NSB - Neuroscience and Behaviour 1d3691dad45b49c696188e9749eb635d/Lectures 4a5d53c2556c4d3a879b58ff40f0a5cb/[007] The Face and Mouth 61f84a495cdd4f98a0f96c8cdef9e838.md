# [007] The Face and Mouth

# Infratemporal and Temporal Fossae

- Within these spaces, there are lots of soft tissues that go to the face and upper neck
- The muscles of mastication and the parotid gland (main salivary gland) are also found here

### Temporal Fossa

- This is the most lateral fossa of the face and is a rounded fossa found on the Superolateral Aspect of the Skull
- This is found between the Superior Temporal Line found superiorly and across the Frontal Bone anteriorly and the Occipital Bone posteriorly (Superior and Posterior Boundary), the Zygomatic Process and Lateral Surface of the Mandible inferiorly, Zygomatic Arch anteroinferiorly and the Frontal and the Sphenoid Bones anteriorly
- The Posterior Boundary is the Styloid process and Tympanic Plate of the Temporal Bone

### Infratemporal Fossa

- This is found between the Pharynx medially and the medial side of the ascending ramus of the mandible laterally
- The Roof of the Infratemporal Fossa is formed predominantly by the Inferior Surface of the Greater Wing of the Sphenoid
- The Stylomastoid Foramen is found just deep/medial to the Mastoid Process of the Temporal Bone and just lateral to the Styloid Process of the Temporal Bone
- The Styloid Process of the Temporal Bone and Tympanic Plate of the Temporal Bone form the Posterior Aspect of the Roof of the Infratemporal Fossa and the Medial and Lateral Pterygoid Plates of the Sphenoid form the Anterior Aspect of its Medial Border

- They both lie beneath the greater wings of the sphenoid
- They both have posterior boundaries as the styloid process and tympanic plate of the temporal bone

# Mandible

- It is a single, U-shaped bone
- During embryological development, it starts out as two separate bones which fuses around birth at the Mandibular Symphysis
- Constituent parts and landmarks of the mandible:
- It has two mandibular condyles, found posterior to the Mandibular Notch at its posterior most end, which articulate with the Right and Left Temporal Bones at the Temporomandibular Joints
- The Body of the Mandible lies on either side of the Mouth, running transversely, and is continuous with the Mandibular Symphysis in the Midline anteriorly
- There is a triangular shaped process called the coronoid process which is found on Superior tip of the Ascending Mandibular Ramus, anterior to the Mandibular Notch
- Between the condylar and coronoid processes posterior and anteriorly there is the mandibular notch in the Superior End of the Ascending Ramus
- The whole upsweep/superiorly projection region of bone is called the ramus of the mandible
- The Ascending Ramus of the Mandible runs between the Posterior Aspect of the Mandibular Body inferiorly and the Mandibular Condyle superiorly
- The angle of the mandible is found at the posterior end of the Mandibular Body, where it meets the Ascending Mandibular Ramus
- This is typically quite sharp
- The alveolar process is a region of Hard bone found superior to the Body and holds the teeth
- Anteriorly, there is a mental foramen bilaterally, on either side of the Midline, that transmits the Mental Vessels
- The mandibular foramen is found on both sides on the inside/medial Surface of the Ascending Mandibular Ramus
- On the Inner Side of the Anteromedial Aspect of the body of the mandible (Near the Mandibular Symphysis, there are 2 tubercles called the genial fossa/Genial Spines, where some muscles of the Tongue attach
- There is a line along the Inner Surface of the body of the mandible on both sides which runs anteroinferiorly, called the Mylohyoid line
- This is the ridge on the mandible where the mylohyoid muscle attaches
- The mylohyoid is important in determining where infections can track

![f008-249-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-249-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Mandibular Fractures (D&P)

- These are common and some fractures (E.g Mandibular Condyle Fractures) are left to remodel without treatment
- Fractures of the Mandibular Condyle usually occur after a blow to the Chin
- Other fractures are more serious and can occur in many weak sites along the Mandibular Body, Mandibular Symphysis or Ascending Mandibular Ramus
- The Direction/Angle of the Fracture line determines whether or not the Muscles of Mastication hold the Broken ends of the Bone in Place
- Unfavourable Fractures tend to pull apart whilst Favourable Fractures are held together by the contraction of the Masticatory Muscles

# Temporomandibular Joint

- It is a gliding/rotating hinge joint that is formed between the Glenoid Fossa on the Inferior Surface of the Temporal Bone and the Condyle/Head of the Mandible
- The Joint Cavity of the TMJ is divided into a upper and lower compartment (in relation to the skull) by a fibrocartilaginous articular disc/meniscus the runs transversely through the Joint Space
- It has a fibrous capsule which is attached to its articular margins and lined with a Synovial membrane
- The Lateral Part of this capsule is thickened to form a Lateral Ligament
- The Joint Capsule is slack enough to allow small side-to-side movements to occur
- It contains a Fibrocartilaginous Disc to absorb the forces transmitted through the Mandible due to the powerful actions of the Muscles of Mastication when they close the mouth

### Lower Compartment

- This has a simpler arrangement to the Condylar Upper Compartment and functions like a hinge-joint to allow hinge-like rotation of the Mandibular Condyle during opening and closing of the mouth
- The First 1/2 mm of opening the mouth is completely due to the rotation of the Mandibular Condyle in the Lower Compartment of the TMJ, with the remainder of the opening of the mouth being a combination of sliding and hinge movements by the Upper and Lower Compartments

### Upper Compartment

- This is a long cavity and includes the Concave Surface of the Temporal Bone and a convex bulge on the Inferior Surface of the Roof of the Zygomatic Bulge (Articular Eminence)
- The Articular Eminence is found just superior to the Mandibular Notch
- This is responsible for anteroposterior/sagittal gliding of the mandibular condyle, allowing the Head of the Mandible/Mandibular Condyle to slide anteriorly and posteriorly onto and off of the Articular Eminence
- The articular disc moves with the mandibular condyle as far as the Glenoid Fossa to prevent dislocation of the TMJ
- The disc can slide forward when the mouth is open, and by doing this it positions the condyle out of the fossa and brings it forward
- When opening the mouth, the Articular Disc of the TMJ and the Mandibular Condyle slides anteriorly out of the Glenoid Fossa and onto the Articular Eminence
- The rotating movement of the condyles is always combined with a gliding movement which allows the mouth to be opened wide

### Ligaments of the TMJ

- The Sphenomandibular and Stylomandibular Ligaments attach to the Mandible but are unlikely to limit the movement of the TMJ

**Sphenomandibular Ligament**

- This attaches to the Spine of the Sphenoid on the Base of the Skull and runs inferomedially to attach to the Mandibular Lingula (Small projection from the Medial Surface of the Ascending Mandibular Ramus, just lateral to the Mandibular Foramen)
- This is a embryological remnant of the Perichondrium of Meckel's Cartilage of the 1st Pharyngeal Arch

![Scannable Document on 13 Nov 2021 at 12_57_04 pm.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Scannable_Document_on_13_Nov_2021_at_12_57_04_pm.png)

**Stylomandibular Ligament**

- This arises from the Styloid Process of the Temporal Bone and runs inferomedially to attach to the Angle of the Mandible
- The Styloid Process is found anteromedial to the Mastoid Process on the Base of the Temporal Bone
- It is a condensation of the Deep Cervical Investing Fascia of the Neck between these regions

![Scannable Document on 13 Nov 2021 at 12_57_04 pm 3.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Scannable_Document_on_13_Nov_2021_at_12_57_04_pm_3.png)

# Movements at the Temporomandibular Joint (D&P)

- When the mouth is opened, the Mandibular Condylar and Articular Disc move anteroinferiorly out of the Glenoid Fossa and onto the Articular Eminence of the Temporal Bone whilst the Head of the Condyle rotates on the Inferior Surface of the Articular Disc
- Protrusion occurs when both Mandibular Heads move anteriorly with their Articular Discs (Due to the Action of the Lateral Pterygoids)

### Chewing

- When we chew food, we usually chew on one side for a while and then switch to the other in a rhythmic manner
- This concentrates all the muscle force from both sides of the skull between the teeth of the Chewing Side
- To chew on one side, the Mandible swings over to that side so that the Contralateral Mandibular Condyle slides down onto the Articular Eminence
- On the Chewing Side, the Condyle remains pressed against the Posterior Aspect of the Articular Eminence
- This is why when Px fracture their Mandibular Condylar Necks, it hurts the most when they chew on the Opposite Side

---

# Muscles of Mastication

- Muscles of mastication are extremely powerful and can generate a lot of biting force
- These 4 muscles all insert on the Ascending Ramus and Condyle of the Mandible and are found in the Infratemporal Fossa
- They move the Mandible during chewing, speaking and swallowing
- The Masseter and Temporalis provide Bite Forces to power the strong movements at the TMJ
- The Medial and Lateral Pterygoids regulate the movement of the TMJ to ensure it is not too strong (prevents damage to teeth/jaw or Dislocation of the TMJ)
- Most of the Muscles that act on the TMJ elevate the Mandible to close the Jaw (Only 1 Muscle actively Opens the Jaw) as the opening of the Jaw is assisted passively by Gravity

### Masseter

- The Deeper Part originates from the Inner surface of the Zygomatic Arch and runs inferiorly to insert on the the Outer Aspect of the Ascending Mandibular Ramus
- The Superficial Part originates anterior to the Deep Part from the Inferior Surface of the Zygomatic Arch and inserts to the Outer Surface of the Ascending Mandibular Ramus
- This is on the outside/external surface of the ramus of the mandible
- It runs posteroinferiorly and elevates/raises and protrudes the mandible and closes the mouth to occlude the teeth together
- It is square shaped and can be palpated

![f008-141-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-141-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Temporalis

- This has a wide origin, originating posterior to the orbit from the Temporal Lines of the parietal, temporal and frontal bones (Lateral Aspect of the Cranial Vault) and from the Zygomatic Fascia that covers the surface of the Temporalis
- It passes through the Temporal Fossa and Deep to Masseter and Zygomatic Arch
- It then fans out and passes deep to the zygomatic arch and attaches to the Coronoid process of the mandible and the inner/medial surface of the Anterior Border of the Ascending Mandibular Ramus
- Anterior fibres run vertically from the Temporal Bone and elevate the mandible to occlude the teeth, whilst posterior fibres from the Parietal Bone runs almost horizontally and retract the mandible
- This can be palpated during mastication

![f008-143-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-143-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Lateral and Medial Pterygoids

**Lateral Pterygoid**

- It originates as 2 heads - The Upper Head originates from the Inferior Surface of the Greater Wing of the Sphenoid (Roof of the Infratemporal Fossa) and the Lower Head originates from the Lateral Aspect of the Lateral Pterygoid Plate of the Sphenoid (Medial Wall of the Infratemporal Fossa)
- These regions of the Sphenoid are continuous with one another
- Some Neurovascular Structures pass between the 2 Heads of the Lateral Pterygoid to pass in/out of the Infratemporal Fossa
- The 2 Heads then runs posterolaterally and converges to insert predominantly onto the Fovea on the Neck of the Mandible, just inferior to the Mandibular Condyle
- A Part of the Upper Head inserts onto the Disc/Meniscus of the TMJ.
- It depresses/lowers and protrudes the mandible, moves the articular disc forwards (to pad the space in the joint that appears anteriorly when the Jaw is protruded) and stabilises the Articular Disc of the TMJ and Head of the Mandibular Condyle against the Posterior Slope of the Articular Eminence as they slide back into the Glenoid Fossa when closing the mouth

![f008-147-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-147-9780323393041.jpeg)

**Medial Pterygoid**

- This originates from the medial surface of the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid and inserts on the medial surface of the mandibular angle
- It runs inferolaterally (same angle as the Masseter and Perpendicular to the Lateral Pterygoids) to reach the lower margin of the Ascending Mandibular Ramus.
- It elevates/lifts and protrudes the mandible
- Together, with masseter on the outside and the medial pterygoid on the inside of the mandibular ramus, they create a sling which controls the movement of the mandible, notably when both muscles are activated together
- This allows adaptation of the force of chewing, and protects the teeth

![f008-146-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-146-9780323393041.jpeg)

- All masticatory muscles are innervated by a motor branch of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3)
- This comes through the foramen ovale in the posterior part of the sphenoid
- Trigeminal nerve issues therefore may lead to problems with chewing

### Chewing (D&P)

- This is a very complex process, with many of the Mastication Muscles being active at different points during the Chewing Cycle
- Chewing Involves an alternating pattern of Lateral Mandibular Movements (Shifts the Mandible from Left to Right) as well as grinding the teeth on one side together
- The Masseter and Pterygoids play an important role in the Lateral Movement of the Mandible whilst also opening and closing the mouth by depressing and elevating the Mandible respectively.
- There is no lateral movement of the Mandible during speech, only elevation and depression.
- When Swallowing Solids, there is bilateral occlusion of the teeth whilst the tongue forces food backwards into the Oropharynx

---

# Movements of the Mandible

- The masseter is important for protrusion and retraction movements as well as elevation/depression
- The masseter does not play a significant role in lateral movement, this is carried out mainly by the medial pterygoid

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 17.49.55.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_17.49.55.png)

- Opening the Mouth against resistance is mediated by the Lower Head of the Lateral Pterygoid and the Digastric
- Gravity is usually responsible for opening the mouth when the muscles are relaxed
- The Temporalis, Masseter and Medial Pterygoid all close the mouth and occlude the teeth
- It is easier to hold someone’s mouth shut than it is to pry it apart due to the action of these strong muscles
- During Jaw Closure, the Upper Head of the Lateral Pterygoid is also active to stead the disc whilst it moves posteriorly into the Glenoid Fossa from the Articular Eminence

![f008-140-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-140-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Infratemporal Fossa

### Parotid Gland

- This is found in the infratemporal fossa
- It is the main salivary gland of the Mouth and it is a fairly sizeable Serous gland which wraps around the Inferior and Anterior Margins of the Ear, Lateral to the Ascending Mandibular Ramus and extends medially into the Infratemporal Fossa
- It is also found anterior to the Mastoid Process of the Temporal Bone and the SCM
- The Part of the Parotid Gland found lying on the Lateral Surface of the Ascending Mandibular Ramus, extending anteriorly onto the Surface of the Masseter (Along the Parotid Duct) is the Superficial Lobe
- The Deep/Medial Tapering Border of the Parotid Gland, Deep/Medial to CN VII is the Deep Lobe (CN VII Separates the Superficial and Deep Lobes of the Parotid Gland)
- This is found just lateral to the Styloid Process, Its associated Muscles and the External Carotid Artery and Retromandibular Vein
- The External Carotid Artery and Retromandibular Vein pierce the Deep Lobe of the Parotid Gland and like the Motor Branches of CN VII, run within the Substance of the Parotid Duct
- The Retromandibular Vein is found just deep to CN VII and the External Carotid Artery is found deep to the Retromandibular Vein (Deepest Structure within the Parotid Gland)
- Posterior to the Deep Lobe, The Superior Most Aspect of the Parotid Gland (Glenoid Lobe) extends up to the Neck of the Mandible and is found Posterior to the TMJ, in contact with the Bony Component of the External Auditory Meatus
- The Glenoid Lobe of the Parotid Gland is also closely associated to the Auricotemporal Nerve from CN V3, which carries PSNS Fibres from CN IX to the Parotid Gland

![Scannable Document 2 on 13 Nov 2021 at 1_28_23 pm.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Scannable_Document_2_on_13_Nov_2021_at_1_28_23_pm.png)

- During its development, the Parotid Gland grows out from the Oral Cavity and back into the Structures of the Neck and Face, posterior to the Mandible
- When producing serous secretions, the Parotid Gland squeezes into the Space surrounding the Mandibular Ramus
- The Parotid Gland is completely surrounded by the Deep Investing Fascia of the Neck, meaning that when the Parotid Gland Swells (E.g Mumps/Viral Parotitis), this generates tension on the Fascia and Gland, causing significant pain
- The saliva lubricates the food and allows it to travel through the GI tract more easily
- The Parotid Duct emerges from the Convex Anterior Edge of the Gland and travels anteriorly to pierce the Buccinator and Cheek to enter the Oral Cavity, at the level of the Neck of the 2nd Upper Molar Tooth
- If this duct were to drain into the Oral Cavity any lower down, it would be prone to being chewed when we eat

![Scannable Document on 13 Nov 2021 at 1_28_23 pm.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Scannable_Document_on_13_Nov_2021_at_1_28_23_pm.png)

- CN VII Pierces the Substance of the Parotid Gland as it runs anteriorly, giving off Motor Branches which are embedded within the Parotid Gland and emerge from the Anterior Edge of the Gland to pass to and innervate the Facial Structures.
- It is therefore very difficult to remove cysts or tumours of the Parotid Gland as there is the potential to Damage the External Carotid Artery, Retromandibular Vein and Motor Branches of CN VII if these structures are not correctly identified
- PSNS Innervation comes from CN IX via Preganglion PSNS Fibres travelling in the Lesser Petrosal Nerve.
- These then travel through the Foramen Ovale to synapse in the Otic Ganglion, where Postganglionic PSNS Fibres travel down the Auriculotemporal Nerve from CN V3
- SNS Innervation is via the Superior Cervical Ganglion, with Postganglionic Fibres also travelling in the Auriculotemporal Nerve
- Whilst the PSNS Fibres stimulate Salivary Secretion from the Parotid Gland, SNS Fibres are Vasomotor to the Vasculature supplying the Parotid Gland and hence, are Secretomotor as the Rate of Saliva Production is partly dependent on the Blood Flow through the Parotid Gland so as SNS Stimulation increases blood flow through Salivary Glands, this can increase the Rate of Salivation
- SNS Fibres from the Superior Cervical Ganglion that also travel down the Auricotemporal Nerve with PSNS Fibres are also important in regulating the composition of Saliva
- Parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation relays with the taste sensation down the Auricotemporal Nerve to alter salivary secretion based upon the taste of the food

![f008-266-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-266-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Facial Nerve

- This enters the Petrous Temporal Bone via the Internal Acoustic Meatus (Alongside CN VIII), with most of the Nerve travelling through the Tympanic Cavity and coming out of the Skull via the Stylomastoid Foramen
- It comes out of the Foramen, emerging underneath the ear and travels anteriorly along its inferior border
- The Motor Branch of CN VII takes this route whilst the Greater Petrosal Nerve (on its way to the Lacrimal Gland) and the Chorda Tympani leave CN VII within the Tympanic Cavity and reach their target by travelling with CN V1 and V3 (once it emerges from the Foramen Ovale) respectively
- As it runs anteriorly, it pierces the superficial substance of the Parotid Gland, dividing into its terminal branches which provides innervation to all the muscles of Facial Expression including Buccinator
- Within the Parotid Gland, it is found superficial to the Retromandibular Vein and External Carotid Artery and the Terminal Branches of the ECA within the Gland
- The Terminal Branches of CN VII pass superior to the Temporal Region (Temporal Branches), Anteriorly across the Zygomatic Arch (Zygomatic Branches), Anteroinferiorly across the Cheek (Buccal Branches), Inferiorly and along the Mandible (Mandibular Branches) and Inferiorly into the Neck (Cervical Branches)
- The Cervical Branch of CN VII innervates Platysma
- A small Posterior Auricular Branch extends posteriorly to innervate the Posterior Belly of the DIgastric and Stylohyoid
- CN VII provides motor control of the Muscles of Facial Expression, Posterior Belly of the Digastric, Stylohyoid and Stapedius (All Derived from the 2nd Pharyngeal Arch)
- CN VII provides sensory innervation to the Skin around the Auricle of the Outer ear and Taste Sensation from the Anterior 2/3rd of the Tongue
- CN VII Provides PSNS Fibres to the Submandibular and Sublingual Glands (These Fibres travel with the Chorda Tympani) and Part of the PSNS Innervation to the Nasal Mucosa (From Fibres that arise in the Pterygopalatine Ganglion and travel down the Chorda Tympani)
- PSNS Fibres are also conveyed in the Great Petrosal Nerve to form the Efferent Limb of the Corneal Reflex

# Vasculture in the Infratemporal Fossa

### Arteries

- The blood vessels are protected by the mandible
- The External Carotid bifurcates posteriorly in the Infratemporal Fossa to form the Maxillary and Superficial Temporal Arteries
- Maxillary takes a complicated course through the Infratemporal Fossa, usually passing between the 2 Heads of the Lateral Pterygoid to enter the Pterygopalatine Fossa
- The Maxillary Artery supplies the ear, nose, palate and pharynx - The Branches from the Proximal/Lateral 1/3rd Part go into bony structures such as the Middle Ear, External Acoustic Meatus, Tympanic Membrane, Maxilla and Mandible, Branches from the Middle 1/3rd go to each of the Muscles of Mastication and the Distal/Medial 1/3rd supplies aspect of the Nose
- These first branches arise near the Sphenopalatine Foramen and travel into bony structures and canals to reach their target site
- The Branches that supply the Muscles of Mastication follow branches of the Mandibular Nerve to reach their target
- Within the Pterygopalatine Fossa (found Media/Deep to the Anterioinferior part of the Infratemporal Fossa) Branches of the Distal 1/3rd of the Maxillary Artery follow the branches of the Pterygopalatine Ganglion
- E.g The Infraorbital Artery travels alongside the Infraorbital Nerve and emerges with it on the cheek through the Infraorbital Foramen

![Screenshot 2021-11-13 at 11.04.30.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Screenshot_2021-11-13_at_11.04.30.png)

- In the infratemporal Fossa, the Maxillary Artery gives off the:
1. Middle Meningeal Artery
- This arises from the Proximal 1/3rd of the Maxillary Artery and ascends into the skull via the Foramen Spinosum, found between the 2 roots of the Auricotemporal Nerve
- It goes onto the skull vault via the Foramen Spinosum inside the meninges (between the Dura and the Periosteum) to supply the bones of the Cranial Vault
- An Accessory Meningeal Artery also arises from the Proximal 1/3rd of the Maxillary Artery and ascends through the foramen Ovale and helps to supply the Trigeminal Ganglion
1. Superior and Inferior alveolar arteries
- Alveolar artery refers to the teeth
- This supplies the gingiva/gum and tooth roots
- The inferior alveolar artery accompanies the Inferior Alveolar Nerve and enters into the bone via the mandibular foramen and runs anteriorly to supply the pulps of the teeth from inside the bone
- Like the Inferior Alveolar Nerve, it emerges from the Anterior Aspect of the Mandible via the Mental Foramen as the Mental Artery to supply the body of the Mandible
1. Superficial temporal artery to supply the scalp, temporalis muscle and parotid gland
- This is seen ascending up the Lateral Aspect of the Infratemporal Fossa
1. The Ascending Pharyngeal Artery goes up and supplies the muscles of the pharynx from behind
2. The facial artery should be seen looping under the inferior margin of the mandible and then going on to the face ascending over the anterior surface of the Mandible

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 18.11.30.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_18.11.30.png)

### Veins

- In the infratemporal fossa (behind the mandible), there is a large network of veins surrounding the Pterygoid Muscles (Between the Mandible and the Pharynx) that forms the pterygoid plexus, which drains the region by draining veins that run with local arteries
- It receives blood from the cavernous sinuses inside of the skull via Emissary Veins that pass through the Foramen Ovale and contribute to the Pterygoid Plexus
- This means that there is a danger of tracking maxillary or Orbital infections (e.g. conjunctivitis or tooth infections) into the region of the cavernous sinus
- It also drains the Basilar part of the Occipital Bone via its connections with veins superiorly but also drains the surrounding Pharynx
- Moreover, Local Anaesthetic given to block the Posterior Superior Alveolar Nerves at the back of the Maxilla can easily be misplaced and distributed into the Cavernous Sinus
- When we yawn, we force venous blood out of the Pterygoid Plexus and therefore, Large Amounts of Local Anaesthetic can be forced into the Cavernous Sinus when we yawn
- This may produce a temporary Anaesthesia of CN VI (as this is the only CN to run free in the Venous blood of the Cavernous Sinus and not in its Lateral Wall), causing the Px to temporarily have Diplopia after Wisdom Teeth Removal as Px is temporarily unable to Abduct the eye (As Lateral Rectus is paralysed)
- There are vast anastomoses from the cavernous sinus with the Inferior Orbital Veins, facial veins through to the internal jugular vein, meaning the plexus also receives blood from the inferior orbital veins which pass through the Inferior Orbital Fissure
- The Pterygoid Plexus drains into a pair of Short Maxillary Veins, found deep to the Mandibular Neck. These join the Superficial Temporal Vein to form the Retromandibular Vein, which drains into the Internal and External Jugular Veins
- The Deep Facial Vein runs posterosuperiorly to connect the Pterygoid Plexus posteriorly and the Facial Vein anteriorly but also to the Cavernous Sinus

![f008-152-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-152-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Neural Structures in the Infratemporal Fossa

- This is mainly associated with structures leaving the Intracranial Region via the Foramen Ovale or Stylomastoid Foramen and mostly ending in the Mouth
- These are embedded on the space behind the mandible and lying on the chewing muscles and include:
1. Motor and Sensory Fibres from CN V3 via Foramen Ovale going to the Mouth
2. Motor Fibres from CN VII to the Facial Musculature via the Stylomastoid Foramen
3. Chorda Tympani from CN VII which accompanies the Lingual Nerve
- In the Posterior Aspect of the Infratemporal Fossa, the Internal Carotid Artery, Internal Jugular Vein CN IX, CN X, CN XI and CN XII are found running to their associated foramina and leaving the Skull Base.
- These are found deep to the Styloid Process of the Temporal Bone and its associated Musculature

![Screenshot 2021-11-16 at 19.04.01.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Screenshot_2021-11-16_at_19.04.01.png)

### CN V3

- CN V3 descends through the Foramen Ovale to enter the Infratemporal Fossa and unlike CN V1 and V2, it carries both sensory and motor fibres
- In the Infratemporal Fossa, it is found deep to the Lateral Pterygoid and on the surface of Tensor Veli Palatini
- Here, it gives off a small sensory branch which follows the Middle Meningeal Artery through the Foramen Spinosum to supply part of the Middle Cranial Fossa and the Mastoid Air Cells
- Just inferior to the Foramen Ovale, the Otic Ganglion (PSNS) is found suspended from CN V3, containing synapses between pre and postganglionic PSNS Fibres that innervate the Parotid Gland and SNS Fibres that pass through it but do not synapse within it
- Within the Infratemporal Fossa, CN V3 divides into Anterior and Posterior Divisions, with all the branches of the Anterior Division being motor to the muscles of Mastication and to Tensor Veli Palatini
- The Masseter is innervated by a branch from the Anterior Division which reaches the muscle by passing through the Mandibular Notch
- The Long Buccal Nerve is the only sensory branch of the Anterior Division of the Mandibular Nerve, arising Superiorly in the Infratemporal Fossa and running between the 2 Heads of the Lateral Pterygoid to carry sensation to the Inside and Outside of the Cheek
- The Posterior Division of CN V3 contains mainly sensory fibres.
- The Lingual and Inferior Alveolar Nerve arise from the Posterior Division and lie on the Lateral Surface of the Medial Pterygoid in the Infratemporal Fossa
- The Lingual Nerve travels anterior to provide General Sensory Innervation to the Anterior 2/3rd of the Tongue

### Inferior Alveolar Nerve

- The inferior alveolar nerve passes down over the Lateral Surface of the Medial Pterygoid Muscle enters the mandible via the mandibular foramen (on the Medial Surface of the Ascending Mandibular Ramus)
- It then runs anteriorly through the Mandible (inferior to the Teeth) to provide sensory innervation to the Lower Teeth
- It emerges from the Front of the Mandible via the Mental Foramen as the Mental Nerve to provide sensory innervation to the skin of the Lower Lip and Point of the Chin
- Before emerging from the Mental Foramen, the Inferior Alveolar Nerve gives off the Nerve to Mylohyoid (Only Motor Nerve of the Posterior Division) which supplies Mylohyoid and Anterior Belly of the Digastric

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 18.15.27.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_18.15.27.png)

- This supplies all the teeth of the lower jaw
- Tooth aches of the lower jaw are therefore conveyed via this large nerve
- The nerve supply to the teeth needs to be from such a large nerve to give an accurate idea of the tension and pressure on that given tooth
- This prevents splintering of the teeth when there are large chewing forces

![f008-281-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-281-9780323393041.jpeg)

- The motor nerves supply the chewing muscles, particularly the temporalis

### Auricotemporal Nerve

- The auriculotemporal nerve also arises from the Posterior Division of CN V3 and tracks autonomic fibres to and from the parotid gland whilst providing sensory innervation to the Auricle and Temple
- The Auricotemporal Nerve is the third important sensory branch of the Posterior Division of CN V3
- It has 2 nerve roots which are found either side and surrounding the Middle Meningeal Artery.
- It then passes laterally to supply sensation to part of the ear, tympanic membrane and temple
- At its origin, it is found close to the Otic Ganglion

![f008-149a-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-149a-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Lesser Superficial Petrosal Nerve

- PSNS Neurons that synapse in the Otic Ganglion leave CN IX just below the Jugular Foramen and pass superiorly through the Petrous Temporal Bone and Tympanic Cavity, moving anteriorly to leave the Tympanic Cavity through its anterior surface as the Lesser Superficial Petrosal Nerve
- This descends with CN V3 through the Foramen Ovale where it enters the Otic Ganglion and synapses within it.
- From the Otic Ganglion, Secretomotor Postganglion PSNS enter the Auriculotemporal Nerve and run here, lateral to the Mandible to enter the Parotid Gland
- SNS Neurons which innervate the Parotid Gland do also pass through the Otic Ganglion but do not synapse within it

![f008-150b-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-150b-9780323393041.jpeg)

### CN VII

- Motor and sensory fibres from the facial nerve (VII) run to superficial musculature of the face via the stylomastoid foramen
- The Chorda Tympani from CN VII (One of its 2 PSNS Bundles alongside the Greater Superficial Petrosal Nerve, which aims for the Pterygopalatine Ganglion) joins the Lingual Nerve under the Skull Base, running through the Middle Ear to leave the Floor of the Tympanic Cavity via the Petrotympanic Fissure (found very close to the Spine of the Sphenoid Bone and the Foramen Ovale)
- Therefore, the close proximity of the Foramen Ovale and the Petrotympanic Fissure means that the Chorda Tympani has only a short distance to travel before it joins the Lingual Nerve
- PSNS Fibres from the Chorda Tympani hitch hike down the Lingual Nerve to supply Motor Fibres to the Submandibular and Sublingual Glands and Taste Sensation to the Anterior 2/3rds of the Tongue

# Visceral/Facial Skull

- The mandible is part of the lower face
- The middle face consists of the maxilla and two small bones on the back of the maxilla called the palatine bones
- These are found at the back of the hard palate, which is mostly made up of the maxilla
- It also consists of the zygomatic bone
- The temporal bone via the zygomatic process also forms an aspect of the face
- The sphenoid bone also is involved at the back as it forms part of the nasal cavity
- The hyoid is also part of the face as it is tightly linked with part of the mandible
- The nasal bones also play a role
- It follows a musculoskeletal growth trajectory
- Face growth is observed at least until 18 years of age
- It takes at least this long to put the teeth in the right place
- The facial bones reorganise themselves around the teeth
- The growth pattern for the neurocranium is very different, where it stops growing at 10 – 12 years of age as the brain does not significantly change in mass

# Motor Branches of the Facial Nerve (VII)

- Motor fibres leave the posterior cranial fossa via Petrous Temporal Bone and then via the stylomastoid foramen (Just Posterior to the Ear, between the Mastoid Process Posterolaterally and the Styloid Process medially)
- These fibres pass underneath and through the Parotid Gland
- The branches almost appear like putting the palm of the hand on the face
- The Posterior Auricular Ascends to innervate the Muscles surrounding the Ear
- Temporal branches are on the upper part of the side of the skull
- There are zygomatic branches onto the zygomatic bone
- There are also upper buccal, lower buccal, Marginal Mandibular and Cervical branches
- The Cervical Branch innervates the Platysma
- They supply the facial expression musculature

![f008-066-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-066-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Facial Muscles of Expression

- Muscles of Facial Expression = Superficial Musculature of the face that surrounds the ear, nose, orbit and mouth, around which they form sphincters and dilators
- These can carry out functions such as opening or closing the eyes, raising the eyebrows or wrinkling the nose
- They are all innervated by CN VII
- Orbicularis oculi close the eyes

![f008-057-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-057-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Orbicularis Oris

- Orbicularis Oris is a continuous ring of Muscle and hence, does not have a bony origin
- It is surrounded by Muscles that raise the Upper Lip and Raise or Depress the corner of the mouth, organised in a radial manner around the muscle
- Orbicularis oris keeps the lips closed
- This is important for both facial  expression and eating
- Food would fall out if we could not close our mouths
- There is also better traction on what the teeth do with the food

![f008-059-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-059-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Buccinator

- This is found deep within the Cheek, deeper than the other Muscles of Facial Expression
- It arises from the Pterygomandibular Raphé (The Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor originates from the posterior edge of this Raphé)
- It then runs anteriorly across the Lateral Face (Cheek) to insert onto the Lateral Angles of the Mouth
- Along most of its length, it is attached above and below to the Molar and Premolar Teeth Posteriorly and to the Maxilla and Mandible Anteriorly
- As the Upper and Lower Fibres of Buccinator approach the Angle of the Mouth, they cross at a point just lateral to this Angle (Modiolus) where they become continuous anteriorly with Orbicularis Oris
- Buccinator in the cheek is a muscle of facial expression helps to squeeze food from the cheek posteriorly between the teeth and into the mouth again for more chewing before being swallowed
- To some extent, it controls the flow of Saliva though the Parotid Duct and prevents food and debris/air from being squeezed into and through the Parotid Duct. It does this by contracting around the duct as the Duct pierces it to enter the Oral Cavity
- The tensing of the cheeks is vital in eating as it prevents food from pilling up in the pouch that the cheek forms on the outside of the teeth
- It is difficult to get food out of this space without the muscle pushing food towards the midline of the mouth again
- It allows tightening and smoothing of the cheeks
- This is highly automatized and is innervated by CN VII
- This becomes obvious in individuals with facial palsy as these individuals find it difficult to chew on the side where the muscle is paralysed

### Occipitofrontalis

- Frontalis originates from the Anterior Margin of the Epicranial Aponeurosis and runs inferomedially to insert onto the Superior Margin of Orbicularis Oculi
- Occipitalis originates from the Occipital Bone and Styloid Process of the Temporal Bone and inserts runs superior to insert onto the Posterior Margin of the Epicranial Aponeurosis
- The Frontalis and Occipitalis are connected to one another via the Epicranial Aponeurosis superiorly and hence, the whole structure (Frontalis + Epicranial Aponeurosis + Frontalis) forms Occipitofrontalis

![Frontalis-Image.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Frontalis-Image.png)

- These muscles can be used independently from each other
- There are no sphincter muscles around the nose (this would be disadvantageous) but there are small muscles which can dilate the nostrils and act as important accessory muscles of respiration (less significant in humans)

# Sensory and Motor Distribution of the Trigeminal Nerve on the Face

### Sensory Supply

- Sensory supply of the face is provided by the trigeminal nerve (all three branches)
- This includes touch, pressure, temperature and pain, which is relayed to the Trigeminal Nuclei in the Brainstem
- CN V1 = Forehead and Upper Eye Area
- CN V2 = Under Eye/Cheek Area and Upper Lip
- CN V3 = Jaw and Lower Lip
- CN VII can be tested by asking the Px to screw up their eyes or show their teeth, with the inability to do this unilaterally indicating a CN VII Lesion
- Bell's Palsy commonly follows inflammation of CN VII travels in the Facial Canal within the Petrous Temporal Bone
- In Bell’s palsy, there is a CN VII Lesion, meaning that both Ipsilateral and Contralateral CN VII Fibres travelling in the Periphery are damaged
- This means that the entirely of the Ipsilateral Face (Orbicularis Oculi, Levator Palpebrae Superioris and Facial Expression Muscles) are paralysed, causing the entirely of the Ipsilateral Face to droop due to Muscle Paralysis
- An Upper Motor Neuron Lesion affecting CN VII (Stroke in Motor Cortex or Upper Nuclei) present differently as since Fibres from the Left and Right Sides of the brain both innervate the Muscles above the level of the Eye, the Orbicularis Oculi, Levator Palpebrae Superioris and other muscles of the Upper Face remains unaffected/not drooping in Unilateral UMN Lesions (As it remains innervated by Fibres from the Contralateral CN VII)
- However, the Lower Facial Muscles received fibres from only one side of the Brain and therefore, are unable to perform Voluntary movements on the Ipsilateral Side as the Lesion (Same As Bell's Palsy), causing paralysis of the Muscles of Facial Expression (Causes Drooping of the Mouth etc)
- Therefore Whilst Bell's Palsy affects the Entire Ipsilateral Face, Strokes/UMN Lesions mainly affect the Lower Ipsilateral Face (Px can still voluntary move the muscles around the eye and forehead)

### Motor Innervation

- Muscles of mastication are supplied by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (V3)
- The muscles of facial expression are supplied by the facial nerve (VII)

![f008-064-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-064-9780323393041%201.jpeg)

# Vasculature of the Face

### Arteries

- The face is supplied by the facial artery
- The Facial Artery branches from the External Carotid Artery just superior to the Lingual Artery and travels anteriorly to reach the Border of the Mandible, just anterior to the Masseter
- From here, it twists and coils as it runs anteriorly past the Angle of the Mouth and the Nose.
- This coiled appearance of the Facial Artery allows it to stretch, allowing for movements of the Face and Jaw without Damaging the Facial Artery (E.g When the Jaw is opened widely, the Facial Artery is stretched so it is straighter)
- After curling under the Mandible, the Facial Artery ascends superomedially across the Anterolateral Face
- The Facial Artery becomes the Angular Artery when it reaches the side of the nose
- It then ascends to reach the Medial Corner of the Eye to anastomose with Orbital Vessels whilst some terminal branches also continue into the Scalp to anastomose with Scalp Vessels
- As it ascends up the face, it gives off Labial Branches to the Lips and Branches to supply the External Nose
- It also gives off a branch that runs superoposteriorly across the cheek to anastomose with the Transverse Facial Branch of the Superficial Temporal Artery

![f008-067-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-067-9780323393041.jpeg)

- The Facial Veins accompanies the Facial Artery, deep to the Zygomasticus Major in the Cheek but whilst the Facial Vein passes superficial to Zygomasticus Minor, the Facial Artery Runs deep to Zygomasticus Minor as it ascends to reach the Medial Angle of the Eye
- The Vein remains more superficial here and communicates with the Orbital Veins and Intracranial Sinuses (Notable Cavernous Sinus) more superiorly)
- Posteriorly, the Facial Vein joins the Anterior Branch of the Retromandibular vein to form the Common Facial Vein which drains into the Internal Jugular Vein
- The Posterior Aspect of the Face can be drained by the Pharyngeal Venous Plexus into the Retromandibular Vein (and then to the External Jugular Vein via the Posterior Branch)

# Boundaries of the Oral Cavity

- The roof consists of the hard and soft palate, with the Hard Palate found anterior to the Soft Palate
- The Hard Palate has a bony roof
- The soft palate is a entirely muscular, acting as a flap of skin with a uvula hanging down from the back of the mouth
- The soft palate acts as a valve which allows closure of the nasal cavity from the mouth
- This is important in swallowing as it prevents food from entering the nasal cavity
- The floor is mainly muscular and consists of the mylohyoid muscle, going from one side of the mandible to the other and attaching to the hyoid at the back
- The geniohyoid has a role in strengthening
- Anteriorly, there are the teeth and lips
- Posteriorly, there are the palatoglossal arches
- These are found at the back of the mouth behind the tooth row, where the soft palate hangs down and the pharynx comes around, there are soft folds of tissue that give the back of the mouth shape

# Roof of the Mouth

- The Palate divides the Oral Cavity inferiorly from the Nasal Cavity superior
- The Bony Palate is bounded anteriorly and laterally by the Alveolar Processes of the Maxillae
- The Maxillary Teeth lie in this ridge of supporting bone
- The Anterior 2/3rds of the Bony Hard Palate is formed by the palatine Process of the Maxillae whilst the Posterior 1/3rd of the Hard Palate is made up of the two Horizontal Plates of the Palatine Bones, with the bones meeting in a Cruciform Shaped Suture System
- The Two Sides of the Bony Hard Palate are divided by the Midline Intermaxillary Suture.
- As the Greater Palatine Canal Descends from the Pterygopalatine Fossa towards the Hard Palate, it divides and forms the Greater and Lesser Palatine Fossae on the Hard Palate
- The Greater Palatine Fossa is found just medial to the Upper Third Molar Tooth in the Palatine Bone and transmits the Greater Palatine Nerve and Vessels, which run anteriorly in a groove at the Lateral Aspect of the Hard Palate
- The Lesser Palatine Fossa is found just posterior to the Greater Palatine Fossa and transmits the Lesser Palatine Nerve and Vessels, which run posteriorly into the Soft Palate
- Just Posterior to the Incisor Teeth is the Incisive Fossa and Canal, Found at the Anterior end of the Intermaxillary Suture.
- This transmits the terminal branches of the Nasopalatine Nerve into the Anterior Aspect of the Hard but also branches of the Greater Palatine Artery superior into the Nose
- Anteriorly, the Mucous Membrane of the Hand Palate is folded into Ridges called Palatine Rugae, which are important in speech and eating (they rub food into the surface of the tongue and contribute to the ability to taste things and judge texture)
- Mucous and Minor Salivary Gland can also be found in the Mucous Membrane of the Palate

# Floor of the Mouth

- The Anterior Belly of the Digastric, Mylohyoid and Stylohyoid form a muscular bed for the tongue to rest on and provide support for the Sublingual and Submandibular Glands
- As the Posterior Belly of the Digastric and the Stylohyoid are derived from the 2nd Pharyngeal Arch, they are innervated by CN VII

![800wm.jpg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/800wm.jpg)

### Mylohyoid

- This is a triangular shaped muscle that forms a sling/diaphragm across the floor of the mouth.
- It originates from the Inner/Medial aspect of the Mandible, raising an oblique ridge on the Body of the Mandible called the Mylohyoid Line
- It runs medially to insert anteriorly on the Medial Surface of the Anterior Aspect of the Body of the Hyoid and posteriorly on the midline raphé which extends posteriorly from the Mandibular Symphysis
- It elevates the Hyoid (alongside the Digastric and Stylohyoid) to raise the floor of the mouth
- As it is derived from the 1st Pharyngeal Arch (Alongside the Anterior Belly of the Digastric) it is innervated by the Nerve to Mylohyoid which arises from the Inferior Alveolar Nerve (Branch of CN V3) and leaves via the Mandibular Foramen at the Posterior End of the Myohyoid Line

![f008-167-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-167-9780323393041%201.jpeg)

### Facial Artery

- When the Facial Artery first arises from the External Carotid Artery, it lies deep to the Digastric and Stylohyoid and on the Superficial Surface of the Superior Pharyngeal Constrictor, Lateral to the Tonsillar Fossa
- At this position, the Facial Artery gives off a branch which pierces the Superior Constrictor to reach the Tonsillar Bed. From here, it then passes superiorly over the Digastric and Stylohyoid and down to the Free Posterior Edge of the Mylohyoid
- Here, it is in contact with Submandibular Gland medially and lies against the Inner Surface of the Body of the Mandible
- From here, it passes inferior to the Mandible to ascend up along its superficial surface to supply the face

![Scannable Document on 13 Nov 2021 at 6_46_21 pm.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Scannable_Document_on_13_Nov_2021_at_6_46_21_pm.png)

- The Hyo**glossus** and Stylo**glossus** insert upon and act on the **Tongue**
- These are found underneath the Muscular Floor of the Mouth, Facial Artery and Superficial Part of the Submandibular Gland

### Hyoglossus

- This is square when seen laterally and originates from the Lateral Sides of the Hyoid and run posterosuperiorly to insert onto the Tongue
- It pulls the tongue down into the tongue
- It is found lateral to Geniohyoid
- The Hyoglossus, Styloglossus, (Extrinsic Tongue Muscles) and all of the Intrinsic Tongue Muscles (Except Palatoglossus) are innervated by CN XII

![f008-257-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-257-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Teeth

- These are the main tool for cutting up (maxillary) and grinding (mandibular) food
- They have roots which reach fairly high up into the mandible and maxilla
- Each root can undergo inflammatory or infectious changes (e.g. abscesses from a cracked tooth)
- These can potentially track elsewhere
- They sit in pockets in the maxillary and mandibular alveolar bone
- The periodontal apparatus secures teeth in the surrounding bone and conveys sensations of touch and pressure to CN V2 and CN V3
- The pattern of tooth eruption is crucial for estimating a child’s age

![f008-278-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-278-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Submandibular and Sublingual Glands

- All the Salivary Glands are ducted/Exocrine
- The Salivary Glands receive their SNS Innervation via T1-T3 and the Superior Cervical Ganglion
- They receive PSNS Innervation from CN VII and the Submandibular Ganglion

### Submandibular Gland

- This is found between the muscles of the floor of the mouth (Anterior Belly of the Digastric, Mylohyoid and Stylohyoid)
- The Deep Part is found on the External/Superficial Surface of the Mylohyoid underneath the floor of the mouth
- The Superficial Part lies on the Inferior Surface of the Myohyoid, in the Neck (It curls around the Posterior Margin of Hyoglossus)
- This is where the Facial Artery grooves the Gland and sometimes, is found within the substance of the Gland
- This is a mixed Serous-Mucous Gland and consists of Deep and Superficial Parts
- The Lingual Nerve is found above the Submandibular Gland and CN XII is found below it
- The Submandibular Duct leaves the Deep Part of the Gland and opens at a small papilla in the Floor of the Mouth, near the midline anteriorly under the tongue and just lateral to the Lingual Frenulum that ties the tip of the tongue superiorly to the mucous membrane on the floor of the mouth
- The Lingual Nerve hooks underneath the Submandibular Gland before ascending medial to it and up into the Tongue
- Stones can occasionally form in the Submandibular Gland and can block the duct which can be felt in the floor of the mouth
- They are usually removed by opening the duct via the Mucous Membrane in the floor of the Mouth

![f008-265-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-265-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Sublingual Gland

- This is a predominantly mucous gland which lies close to the Lingual Nerve, just deep to the Mucous Membrane of the Floor of the Mouth under the tongue
- It is drained by several small ducts, some entering the Submandibular Duct and some opening directly into the floor of the mouth

![f008-265-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-265-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Oral Cavity Volumes

- The Mouth has 2 Potential Spaces:
1. The Oral vestibule/buccal cavity
- This is defined by the outer surface of the teeth and alveolar ridges deep, the cheeks and the lips superficially
- This is between the cheeks and the teeth
- The food is pushed here when it is being processed
- This is often a collapsed space

![340537_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.gif](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/340537_1_En_3_Fig1_HTML.gif)

1. Oral Cavity Proper
- This is the region bounded by the Teeth when they are occluded
- It is almost completely filled by the tongue
- The tongue is put into different shapes to create more space here

![zD8bCMXNn46UJN4oFI7lNg_josj0bHpUf7itD2jokjISQ_Oral_Cavitis_Propria_02.jpg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/zD8bCMXNn46UJN4oFI7lNg_josj0bHpUf7itD2jokjISQ_Oral_Cavitis_Propria_02.jpg)

# The Tongue

- This is divided into an anterior 2/3rds (part of the oral cavity) and posterior 1/3rd (oropharynx) by the Sulcus Terminalis
- In the Midline at the Posterior Apex of the Sulcus Terminalis, there is a shallow pit (Foramen Caecum) which represents the origin of the Thyroid Gland in the floor of the Primitive Pharynx
- The Mucosa of the Tongue is tightly adherent to the underlying musculature and is known as Gustatory Epithelium
- This consists of 4 types of Papillae ('Taste Buds'):
1. Circumvate Papillae - Quite large and noticeable, arranged around the Sulcus Terminalis
2. Fungiform Papillae - These are red (non-keratinised) and found on the Anterior 1/3rd of the Tongue
3. Filiform Papillae - Rougher and Less Red (Keratinised) and are found on the Anterior 2/3rds of the Tongue (Most Numerous Papillae)
4. Foliate Papillae - These are found on the Lateral Edges of the Tongue near the Sulcus Terminalis and are organised into deep folds
- The Posterior 1/3rd of the Tongue is roughened by collections of Lymphoid Tissue in the Mucous Membrane
- Just posterior to the Tip of the Tongue, the Lingual Frenulum is found which separates the Two Submandibular Duct openings
- Posteriorly, there is a midline fold of Mucosa that passes posteriorly to the Epiglottis to separate the 2 Valleculae known as the Median Glossoepiglottic Fold
- It has no bones at all but is just a muscular tissue
- It does not change muscle but the muscle contraction allows a substantial change of shape
- The tongue body of striated muscles has no skeletal components but works like a hydrostat (e.g. like an elephant’s trunk or octopus’s arm)
- The tongue is able to function like a Hydrostat as it doesn't change its volume but the shape can due to the action of Intrinsic Tongue Muscles
- Muscles of the left and right held are separated by a midline fibrous septum/raphe, which serves as an attachment for these muscles
- It has few attachments of its base to the anterior mandible and the hyoid, but the tip moves relatively freely and can be protruded
- It is extremely important in chewing, swallowing, taste sensation and speech articulation
- It makes sure the food is where it belongs between the teeth or other places during the swallowing cycle
- It is vital for taste sensation
- It is a most important speech articulator and involved in the production of majority of sounds in the English language (especially for consonants)
- These are produced by putting the tongue somewhere precise in the mouth to make these sounds

# Blood Supply of the Tongue (D&P)

- The Lingual Artery arises from the External Crotid Artery near the Hyoid Bone and then forms a characteristic superior loop as it passes forwards onto the Superficial Surface of the Middle Pharyngeal Constrictor
- The Main Branches of the Lingual Artery are the Dorsal Lingual Artery (which supplies the Dorsal/Superior Surface of the Tongue) and the Deep Lingual Arteries (which run anteriorly to the Tip of the Tongue and its Inferior Surface
- Dorsal Branches of the Lingual Artery also contribute to the blood supply of the Palatine Tonsil
- The Prominent Blue Veins visible on the Inferior Surface of the Tip of the Tongue are branches of the Deep Lingual Veins which accompany the Deep Lingual Arteries

![f008-260-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-260-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Somatosensory Innervation of the Tongue

- The tongue arises from the floor of the pharyngeal arches
- It can thus be divided into 2/3rds anterior and 1/3rd posterior, each with different embryological remnants
- The innervation of the tongue follows this embryological layout

### **Touch, Temperature and Pain Sensation to the Mucosa:**

- General Sensation (Pain, Touch and Temperature) from the Anterior 2/3rds of the Tongue is provided by the Lingual Nerve of CN V3
- General Sensation (Pain, Touch and Temperature) from the Posterior 1/3rd of the Tongue is provided by CN IX (Touch here can therefore trigger the Gag Reflex)
- The Vallecular area (Small Medial Region posterior to the Tongue, anterior to the Epiglottis and bounded by the Medial and Lateral Glossoepiglottic Folds) receives its general sensory innervation from CN X

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 19.52.38.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_19.52.38.png)

### **Taste (sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami)**

- Umami is an individual taste sensation
- You do not taste different things on different areas of the tongue as Taste Receptors for each of the tastes are equally distributed across the tongue (even in the Vallecular Area)
- The taste is conveyed by different nerves:
- Taste Innervation from the Anterior 2/3rds of the Tongue is provided by the Chorda Tympani of CN VII (which travels within the Lingual Nerve to CN VII in the Petrous Temporal Bone)
- Taste Innervation from the Posterior 1/3rd of the Tongue is provided by the CN IX
- Taste Innervation from the Vallecular Area of the Tongue is provided by CN X (Notably by the Vagoaccessory Fibres containing CN X and Cranial CN XI Fibres)

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 19.55.28.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_19.55.28.png)

# Tongue Musculature and Innervation

- Extrinsic and intrinsic muscles work together

### Intrinsic Muscles

- Intrinsic muscles modify the shape of the tongue and are found within the tongue itself
- These attach the tongue to the midline raphe and the mucosa of the Tongue (only have attachments within the Tongue)
- These are organised into Longitudinal, Transverse and Vertical Muscle Fibres with Longitudinal Fibres being found on the outer edge of the Tongue belly, surrounding a mesh of Transverse and Vertical Intrinsic Fibres
- Fibrous Septa pass between these Differently orientated Muscle Fibres and form a flexible framework for the Dorsum and Tip of the Tongue
- They shape the body of the tongue and give it different outlines
- The intrinsic muscles sit on a bed of extrinsic muscles
    
    ![Scannable Document 5 on 14 Nov 2021 at 12_40_56 pm.png](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/Scannable_Document_5_on_14_Nov_2021_at_12_40_56_pm.png)
    

![f008-255-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-255-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Extrinsic Muscles

- Extrinsic muscles move the tongue body within the oral cavity
- These are the Palatoglossus, Styloglossus, Hyoglossus and Genioglossus
- Extrinsic muscles attach the tongue to the hyoid bone, styloid process, mandible and soft palate (external structures)
- They move the tongue forward and backward, as well as up and down (move the tongue as a whole)

### Genioglossus

- This is an extrinsic muscle that forms a large bulk of the Tongue (found inferior to the Intrinsic Tongue Muscles)
- This originates from Genial Spines on the Inner/Medial Surface of the Anterior Mandible near the Midline
- From its origin, it spreads widely (laterally) to insert into the Whole Length of the Inferior Surface of the Tongue
- It acts to protrude the tongue (when activated bilaterally) and deviate it to the Contralateral Side (when activated unilaterally)
- It is innervated by CN XII

![f008-256-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-256-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Geniohyoid

- This is found deep to Genioglossus
- This originates from Genial Spines on the Inner/Medial Surface of the Anterior Mandible near the Midline
- It then passes posteroinferior to insert onto the Body of the Hyoid
- It acts to pull the Hyoid Superiorly and Anteriorly
- The Anterior Movement of the Hyoid is opposed by Stylohyoid and the Superior Movement of the Hyoid is opposed by the Infrahyoid Muscles
- It is supplied by C1 fibres that travel along the Hypoglossal Nerve from the Cervical Plexus
- It is found Superior/Deep to the Medial Border of Mylohyoid and is a relatively straight and medial muscle

![f008-252-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-252-9780323393041.jpeg)

- The strap muscles that lower the hyoid can bring the tongue down too

![f008-168-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-168-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Motor Innervation

- All of the Nerves of the Tongue (Intrinsic and Extrinsic) are innervated by the Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII)
- The palatoglossus is the exception to this as it is innervated by the vagus (X)
- If the hypoglossal nerve is damaged and the tongue muscles are paralysed, the tongue will deviate to the injured side (This is because the action of Genioglossus on the Unaffected Side is unopposed, which acts to pull the Tongue anteriorly and deviates it to the Opposite Side, where the Lesion is present)
- Palatoglossus is a small muscle that comes down from the pharyngeal tube

![f008-261-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B007%5D%20The%20Face%20and%20Mouth%2061f84a495cdd4f98a0f96c8cdef9e838/f008-261-9780323393041%201.jpeg)

### Hypoglossal Nerve

- It leaves the Skull via the Anterior Condylar Foramen/Hypoglossal Foramen
- In order to descend between the Internal Carotid Artery and Internal Jugular Vein, it must swing out laterally with a very wide arc
- It loops around the External Carotid Artery at the point at which the Occipital and Lingual Arteries arises (Level of the Hyoid Bone)
- CN XII runs quite closely with the Lingual Artery at this level, just inferior to the Inferior Border of the Digastric Muscle, where it is quite superficial
- It then passes onto the Superficial Surface of the Hyoglossus (alongside some C1 fibres that supply Thyrohyoid and Geniohyoid - Nerve to Geniohyoid) where it breaks up to supply the Musculature of the Tongue
- In contrast, the Lingual Artery runs deep to Hyoglossus at its posterior border/margin (on the Superficial/Outer Surface of Genioglossus)

### Lingual Nerve

- This branch of CN V3 first lies on the Lateral Surface of the Medial Pterygoid posteriorly and then travels anteriorly to lie against the Mandible, next to the roots of the last molar tooth
- From here, it enters the floor of the Mouth with the Styloglossus Muscle, running anteroinferiorly to innervate the tongue
- It carries general sensation to the Anterior 2/3rds of the Tongue and Floor of the Mouth, General Sensation to the Gingivae/Gums and the Lingual Aspect of the Teeth and Alveolar Bone of the Mandible
- It also carries special taste sensation from the Anterior 2/3rds of the Tongue (Via the Chorda Tympani) and PSNS Fibres (From CN VII) to the Submandibular and Sublingual Branch
- These Special Taste Afferents leave the tongue in the Lingual Nerve and pass posteriorly through the Chorda Tympani to join CN VII in the Tympanic Cavity
- The Preganglionic PSNS Fibres leave the brain via CN VII and pass into the Chorda Tympani
- They travel down the Chorda Tympani and join the Lingual Nerve before passing into the Submandibular Ganglion (which is suspended from the Lingual Nerve between the Hyoglossus Medially and Deep Part of the Submandibular Gland Laterally)
- Within this Ganglion, Pre and Postganglionic PSNS Fibres Synapse and Postganglionic PSNS Fibres travel down the Lingual Nerve to supply the Salivary Glands and the Mucous Glands of the Floor of the Mouth
- SNS Fibres pass directly through this ganglion without synapsing and are vasomotor in function and hence, secretomotor
