# Visual Acuity Assessment

- In Ophthamological Assessments, it is important to assess:
1. Distance Acuity
2. Near Acuity

---

# Distance Acuity

- Fundamental part of every ophthalmic examination and should be documented in every patient that presents with an ocular complaint
- There are lots of different charts used to assess this but the one most commonly used is the Snellen Chart
- When recording Distance Acuity, the value should appear like a fraction.
- Numerator = Distance at which the patient is placed in relation to the chart
- Denominator = Distance at which a theoretical subject with unimpaired vision can read the same letter (This is standard/constant)
- If Px can only read a part of a line but not a line in its entirety, you write the Px Distance Acuity based on the smallest complete line they can see (the line above) and add ‘+x’ where x is the number of additional letters on the line below that they can see

### Technique

1. Ensure room and test chart well illuminated
2. Position patient at the correct distance (6 metres away from the chart)
3. Visual acuity should be tested with distance glasses on
4. Test each eye separately using a patch, palm of hand or occluder
5. Ask the patient to read down the chart to the smallest print possible. Place pinhole in front of the eye being tested and see whether he can see any further down the chart if Px vision is not 6/6 or better (this can help Px see further down the chart if they have a refractive error such as Myopia/Hyperopia).

### What if the Px Cannot Read the Chart at 6m away?

- Move the patient closer to the chart until they can identify the top letter (this will reduce the numerator)
- For example: if they can see the top letter at 3 metres then you document Right eye = 3/60

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 12.59.44.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_12.59.44.png)

### What if the Px cannot read the Chart at all?

- If the patient cannot see the chart at all you should ask the patient to count the number of fingers displayed and record the longest distance at which counting is done accurately
- For example - Right eye = Count Fingers (CF) at 1m

### What if Px cannot Count Fingers?

- If the patient cannot count fingers, move your hand in front of the patient and record the distance at which the patient reported seeing your hand movement.
- For example - Right eye Hand Movement (HM) at 1m

### What if Px cannot detect Hand Movement?

- If the patient cannot detect hand movement, shine a pen light towards their face and turn it on and off to determine if light perception is present by asking Px to tell you when light is turned on and off
- If they can detect light then Right eye = Light perception (LP)
- If they cannot detect light then Right eye =  No perception to light (NPL)

---

# Near Acuity

- Assessed using a series of paragraphs with increasingly smaller text
- This is more sensitive in identifying macular pathology than distance vision charts as it is Macular Vision that is responsible for high acuity/fine vision (such as reading small text)

### Technique

1. Optimal illumination
2. Patient should be wearing their reading glasses
3. Test each eye separately
4. Ask the patient to hold the chart at a comfortable distance for reading (usually approx 30-40cm)
5. Ask the patient to read the first paragraph, keep moving along to the smaller print paragraphs until they can no longer read
6. Document the smallest print the patient can read
7. E.g Right Eye = N8 at 30 cm (Paragraph 8 at 30 cm)

# Ishihara Plates

- These test colour vision and optic nerve function

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.06.45.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.06.45.png)

### Optic Nerve Function Exam

1. Visual acuity
2. Colour vision
3. Visual Field
4. Pupils - RAPD/Relevant Afferent Pupillary Defect
5. Assessment of optic nerve

### Technique

1. Ensure adequate light
2. Glasses on
3. Test each eye separately
4. Hold at a comfortable distance for reading (40cm)
5. First plate = Test Plates
6. Record number of plates identified (There are often 17 plates) eg Right Eye = 17/17 (Plates Identified)

### Common Considerations

- Can’t see the test plate – Stop the examination and record that the Px could not read test plate
- Can see the test plate but no more/others – Record 1/17
- This indicates optic nerve dysfunction (likely unilaterally) or colour blind (bilaterally)
- If Vision <6/24 then the Px is unlikely to be reading the plates as they have poor vision/visual acuity - In this case, you can hold up coloured objects and asking what the colour is and whether it is different in either eye
- Px is Illiterate/child – Use the plates at the back and trace finger

### Interpretation

- <13/17 Plates read = Abnormal
- Unilateral = Optic Nerve Dysfunction
- Bilateral and Symmetric = Colour Blind
- For Plates 2-9, Px with Red-Green Colour Deficiency will be able to see different numbers
- For Plates 10-17, Px with red-Green Colour Deficiency will be unable to see any numbers

# Pupils

- This provides an objective assessment of CN II Function
1. PERLA – Pupils Equal, Reactive to Light, Accomodation (Normal Result of Pupil Exam)
2. Documentation if all normal
3. Check RAPD (Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect) - This indicates a Pathology proximal to the Optic Chiasm
4. Don’t forget to common on the Lids and Eye Position (Could be present in serious conditions like CN III palsy or Horners Syndrome)

### Technique

1.  Glasses off
2.  Patient fixates in the distance
3. Inspection
4. Dim the lights
5. Direct reflex
6. Consensual reflex
7. RAPD (swinging light test) 
8. Accommodation

### Inspection

- Lids (Drooping etc. - Ptosis is commonly identified by seeing too much of the upper eyelid of one eye in comparison to another)
- Eye position
- Pupils
1. Shape
2. Size
3. Symmetry
- If the Eye is closed unilaterally, pupil is dilated and the gaze is inferolateral at rest, this is indicative of a CN III Palsy

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.12.28.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.12.28.png)

### Direct and Consensual Pupillary Reflex

- Direct reflex – shine light into RIGHT eye and look for constriction in RIGHT eye. Repeat in left
- Consensual reflex– shine light into RIGHT eye and look for constriction in LEFT. Repeat in left

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.13.55.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.13.55.png)

### RAPD

- Tested via the Swinging light test
- This indicates partial damage to the Optic Nerve Ipsilaterally (Pupil is still responsive so CN II is not completely damaged but abnormal response is indicative of some damage)
1. Shine light into right eye for 3 seconds
2. Then to the left eye for 3 seconds
3. Keep alternating between the eyes
- Normal – both eyes constrict on passing the light into each pupil.
- If this occurs Document No RAPD
- Abnormal – on passing the light to the abnormal pupil, it will dilate rather than constrict (it also causes a consensual dilation response on the contralesional eye).
- If this occurs document this pupil as having a (e.g right) RAPD

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.15.55.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.15.55.png)

### Accommodation

1. Ask the patient to fix on a distant target.
2. Bring a near target (e.g your finger or pen) 15cm from their nose and ask them to look at it. Both pupils should constrict.
3. Then ask them to look back at a distance target and the pupils should dilate.
- Checking accommodation involves looking for constriction and convergence of both eyes

---

# Extraocular Muscle Movements

- Testing eye movements can be used to identify
1. Cranial Nerve Palsies
2. Squints
3. Other causes of double vision (Thyroid eye disease, Ocular Myasthenia Gravis)
- CN III Palsy classically presents with unilateral ipsilateral ptosis, fixed dilated pupil and the ipsilateral eye looking inferolaterally
- CN IV Palsy = Slight height difference in the pupils/eyes when looking straight ahead but most commonly is when asking Px to adduct the affected eye, the ipsilateral eye will deviate superomedially vs medially
- This can be congenital
- CN VI Palsy = Inability to abduct the affected eye
- This can be caused by raised ICP

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.17.47.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.17.47.png)

### Terminology

- Intorsion = Rotation/Twisting of the eyes towards the nose/medially
- Extorsion = Rotation/Twisting of the eyes away from the nose/laterally

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.19.15.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.19.15.png)

- There are 9 dfferent positions of Gaze
- At each position of gaze, you are assessing muscles in both eyes
- When testing gazes looking down, it is often helpful to ask the Px to lift up both upper eyelids to maximise your view of the eyeball

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.19.57.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.19.57.png)

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.20.12.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.20.12.png)

### Technique

1. Introduce yourself and explain what you are about to do
- Ensure the patient is aware that only their eyes need to move
1. Ensure there is optimal illumination
2. Using either your finger/pentorch/pen, ask the patient to follow your target into the 9 positions of gaze, starting from the primary position
- Ask the patient to tell you if they have any double vision at any point
1. Always come back to the midline/primary position
- Do not forget to switch hands
- Record if the double vision is horizontal/vertical and in which direction of gaze

### Charting Diplopia

- Each Line = 1 Image and the position of the 2 lines relative to one another indicates the degree and directionality of the Diplopia
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.21.54.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.21.54.png)

# Visual Fields to Confrontation

- Visual Field is the total area in which objects can be seen in the peripheral vision whilst focusing on a central point or the portion of the subject’s surroundings that can be seen at one time

### Normal Limits

- Typical limits of vision from the Resting Gaze is 60° superiorly, 75° inferiorly, 100° temporally/laterally and 60° nasally/medially
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.23.37.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.23.37.png)
    

### Testing Visual Fields

- Clinically = To confrontation
- Formally = Static Perimetry (E.g Humphrey - This is the identification whether static objects can be seen in a visual field when primary gaze is maintained) or Kinetic Perimetry (E.g Goldmann - This is when an object moves around the visual field and the Px reports when they cannot see the target)

### Visual Fields to Confrontation - Set Up

1. Sit one arm’s length away from patient and at same eye level
2. Instruct patient to cover their left eye with palm of their left hand
3. Close/cover your right eye
4. Instruct patient to focus on your open left eye, not looking at your hand

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.25.58.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.25.58.png)

### Test for Quadrantianopia/Hemianopia

1. Ask patient to count your fingers in 4 quadrants (hold up a random number of fingers in each quadrant), using your left hand for the
two left quadrants and your right hand for the right two
2. Keep your fingers stationary
3. Do not present the fingers across the vertical or horizontal midline (ensure you swap hands)
4. If they cannot see a quadrant, then move your fingers slowly towards the vertical and horizontal midlines to map the field defect

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.26.50.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.26.50.png)

### Test the Peripheral Vision

1. Take the white hat pin to test the peripheral vision (use fingers if not available)
2. Ask the patients to say ‘yes’ when they see the white hat pin and compare this to when you are able to see it
3. Start with your arm in full stretch in the superior temporal quadrant and move slowly towards the midline
4. Complete this for the other three quadrants

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.27.37.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.27.37.png)

### Test the Blind Spot

1. Use a red hat pin to test the blind spot 
2. Ask the patient to say ‘gone’ when the red hat pin disappears and then ‘back’ when it returns
3. Start with the hat pin in the middle and very slowly move the hat pin outwards (temporally) along the horizontal midline
4. Map the blind spot in all directions by moving the pin out of the blind spot until the patient says ‘back’, once the red hat pin returns
5. Compare the size of the blind spot to your own

### Repeat for the Other Eye

1. Instruct the patient to cover their right eye with the palm of their right hand
2. Close/cover your left eye
3. Instruct the patient to focus on your open right eye, not looking at your hand
4. Continue with testing quadrants, peripheral vision and blind spot

### Report/Record Your Findings

1. Describe the field defect for each eye individually
2. Describe the overall pattern of field loss (eg bitemporal hemianopia)
3. Suggest site of lesion (eg optic chiasm) 
4. Suggest a cause (eg pituitary adenoma)

# Visual Pathway and Lesions

- Superior fibres from optic radiation
(representing inferior field) travel via
parietal lobe
- Inferior fibres from optic radiation
(representing superior field) travel via temporal lobe
- V1 in each hemisphere receives the encoded visual information of the Contralateral Visual Fields of Both Eyes

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.31.02.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.31.02.png)

### Right Optic Nerve Lesion

- Loss of Vision in Ipsilateral eye

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.34.07.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.34.07.png)

### Optic Chiasm Lesion

- Bitemporal Hemianopia (Loss of vision in temporal fields of both eyes)
- This can arise from a Pituitary Adenoma or Craniopharyngioma

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.34.42.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.34.42.png)

### Right Optic Tract Lesion

- Left Homonymous Hemianopia
- Loss of the Ipsilateral Nasal Field and Contralateral Temporal Field (Contralateral Hemifield)

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.35.12.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.35.12.png)

### Inferior Optic Radiation Lesion in the Right Temporal Lobe

- Left Homonymous Superior Quadrantianopia
- This causes loss of vision in the Superior Aspect of the Contralateral Hemifield (Loss of Superior Aspects of the Ipsilateral Nasal Field and Contralateral Temporal Field)

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.35.42.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.35.42.png)

### Superior Optic Radiation Lesion in the Right Parietal Lobe

- Left Homonymous Inferior Quadrantianopia
- This causes loss of vision in the Superior Aspect of the Contralateral Hemifield (Loss of Inferior Aspects of the Ipsilateral Nasal Field and Contralateral Temporal Field)

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.36.17.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.36.17.png)

### Right Occipital Lobe Lesion

- Left Homonymous Hemianopia with Macular Sparing (Macular Sparing occurs if the Lesion is found extremely posteriorly in the Occipital Lobe)

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.36.43.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.36.43.png)

# Direct Ophthalmoscopy

### Apertures and FIlters

- Large white light – examine the red reflex and fundus of dilated eyes (Main light used)
- Small - examine the red reflex and fundus of undilated eyes (small pupil)
- Light with cross – this is used for presence of either normal or eccentric fixation
- Blue – to examine the surface of the eye with fluorescein dye
- Slit beam – useful for assessing any contour abnormalities (i.e. elevation)
- Green light – red free filter to examine blood/blood vessels/choroidal lesions more

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.43.16.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.43.16.png)

### Adjusting the Ophthalmoscope

- If you are wearing glasses you can either  keep them on or take them off.
- If you take them off you need to adjust for your prescription by using the lens dial on the side of the head to enter your prescription
- Turn the number to the red side if you are short sighted
- Turn the number to the green side if you are long sighted
- If you leave your glasses on, wear contact lenses or do not have any refractive error then leave the dial in
the 0 position.

### Technique

1. Dim the lights
2. Check the red reflex (Look to see if Pupil looks red when light is shone into the eye, checking for symmetry across both eyes)

![download.jpg](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/download.jpg)

1. Place your thumb on the patients eyebrow.
2. Start about 6 inches and 15 degrees lateral to the patient.
3. Slowly move towards patient keeping the light on the patients pupil
4. Identify a vessel and follow its course towards the optic disc.
5. Comment on the colour, contour, cup
6. Examine all four quadrants of the retina
7. Comment on any haemorrhages, exudates, pigmentation, cotton wool spots
8. To see the macula you can ask the patient to look directly into the light of the ophthalmoscope.
9. Comment on any haemorrhages, exudates, pigment
10. Repeat the examination for the left eye

### What are you looking for?

1. Red reflex – present/obscured (altered in anything that stops light from reaching the retina such as corneal opacities, cataract, vitreous haemorrhage, intraocular tumour or retinal detachment).
2. Optic disc – (3 C’s cup, colour, contour). Pathology you may see are disc atrophy, swelling, cupping or new vessels.
3. Blood vessels – haemorrhages, exudates, cotton wool spots
4. Macula - exudates, haemorrhages
- Optic Disc = Outer Circular ring of the Optic Nerve
- Optic Cup = Smaller, Inner ring of the Optic Nerve (appears paler and appears indented)

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 13.47.35.png](%5B061%5D%20Vision%20Practical%20e3d3fd6b87a84bb08a084fae455dd5ce/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_13.47.35.png)

### Exam Tips

1. Know how to switch it on
2. Set ophthalmoscope to zero
3. Choose largest white spot
4. Be nice to the patient
5. Inspection
6. Red reflex
7. Examine
- Optic Disc – 3c’s
- Retina – haemorrhages, CWS, exudates?
- Macula – haemorrhages, exudates
