# Derivates of the Nervous System and Specifying Nervous System

### Derivates of the Nervous System

- Neural ectoderm forms many different cell types, including neuronal populations such as motor neurons, sensory neurons and interneurons.
- Also forms neuronal support cells (glia) such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells (not shown) and ependymal cells.
- Microglia are immune cells (macrophages) found in brain and spinal cord.

### Specifying Nervous System

- The Neural Plate and Crest cells are derived from the Ectoderm
- Neural plate is a collection of stem cells (no neurons) that forms the Central Nervous System via Neurulation.
- The CNS eventually gives rise to Motor Neurons, Interneurons and Glia (Astrocytes and Oligodendrocytes)
- Neural crest is a collection of stem cells (no neurons) that form Peripheral Nervous System.
- The PNS then goes on to form the Sensory and Enteric Neurons but also the Schwann Cells (Peripheral Glia)
- Neural Crest cells also form Facial Cartilage, Adrenal Medulla and Melanocytes

# Mammalian Gastrulation

- 3 germ layers are formed during gastrulation, which occurs during 3rd week of human development.
- Mesoderm is formed by Epiblast cells that migrate through the Primitive Node and Primitive Streak (found caudally) and form the Mesoderm in the Space between the Epiblast and Hypoblast
- Mesoderm cells ingressing through node migrate anteriorly between the Epiblast and Hypoblast to form the prechordal plate and notochord.
- These are Important for specifying the ectoderm overlying these rostral structures into nervous tissue.
- 50% of ectoderm forms nervous tissue.
- 50% of ectoderm forms skin etc.
- Cells ingressing though primitive streak migrate laterally and caudally to form paraxial, intermediate and lateral plate mesoderm moving laterally.
- The type of Mesoderm that forms under the Ectoderm determines whether the Overlying Ectoderm will form nervous tissue or Epidermis (Prechordial Plate and Notochord Specify Nervous Tissue whereas the other Mesodermal types specify Epidermal Tissue)

# Neural Plate and Embryonic Organisers

### Neural Plate

- Formed from cells that remain in epiblast layer (ectoderm), rostral to node and directly above notochord and prechordal plate.
- It expands as primitive streak regresses caudally (as growth of Neural Plate mainly occurs at its Rostral End and not caudally).
- Around 50% of ectodermal cells found in neural plate.

### Spemann-Mangold Organizer

- If Mesodermal Cells from the Rostral Region (which will form the Notochord) of the Embryo are transplanted to the Caudal Region of the Embryo, the Embryo will form 2 Notochords (one Rostral and One Caudal) but not 2 Nervous Systems
- This Caudal Notochord (formed from the Graft) causes the Overlying Ectoderm to develop into another Neural Plate and eventually, another head instead of Epidermis, leading to the development of Conjoined Twins
- This means that the Dorsal Mesoderm of the Rostral Embryo (During the Trilaminar Disc Phase) contains the Spemann-Mangold Organizer, which specifies the Neural Plate and Nervous System from overlying Ectoderm

# Neural Induction and BMP Inhibitors

### Neural Induction

- Nervous system (instead of the Epidermis) is induced in ectoderm by node and dorsal mesoderm (notochord and prechordal plate).
- Notochord induces spinal cord and hindbrain while prechordal plate induces midbrain and forebrain.
- Molecules secreted by node and dorsal mesoderm include proteins such as FGF (fibroblast growth factor), Chordin, Noggin, Follistatin, Cerberus, Dkk1 and FrzB.
- Chordin, Noggin, Follistatin and Cerberus inhibit BMP (bone morphogenetic proteins), signals that promote epidermal differentiation and hence, inhibit nervous tissue differentiation during gastrulation.
- Therefore by inhibiting BMP, Epidermal Differentiation is inhibited, which allows for Nervous Tissue differentiation to occur instead
- Cerberus, Dkk1 and FrzB inhibit Wnt proteins, signals that promote caudal development during gastrulation.
- This allows for the regression of the Primitive Streak and Node to the Caudal Embryo to allow for the Neural Plate to elongate and remain rostrally and therefore, develop the Brain and CNS in the correct place

### BMP Inhibitors

- These are required for Neural Development
- The requirement for Chordin (C), Noggin (N) and Follistatin (F) in neural development was demonstrated in experiments where all 3 proteins were removed from embryo.
- Nervous system is almost eliminated (as indicated by Sox2 expression, which is expressed in the Nervous System) in these embryos while epidermis (indicated by Keratin expression) is expanded.
- This is because the lack of BMP Inhibition means that in Ectoderm that would normally become Nervous Tissue, BMP Inhibition means that Epidermis differentiation is not inhibited, causing this tissue to become Epidermis instead of Nervous Tissue

# Neurulation and Formation of the Neural Tube

### Neurulation

- Process where neural plate folds along midline (Median Hinge Point), bringing lateral edges together dorsally in this midline to form the neural tube.
- Dorsolateral Hinge Points are also induced in the Lateral Aspect of the Neural Plate to ensure that when it folds, there is a cavity/lumen in the Middle (Ensures a tube is formed rather than closing like a book which would form a Thickened Vertical Plate)
- Edges of epidermis dorsal to the Neural Tube also fuse, placing neural tube within embryo
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 17.52.30.png](%5B009%5D%20Development%20of%20the%20Brain%201%204ec192ca3e01469a843db404ef53bdac/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_17.52.30.png)

### Formation of the Neural Tube

- Neurulation occurs during 4th week.
- The edges of the Neural Plate first fuse at boundary between hindbrain and spinal cord (found quite rostrally), with tube closing like a ‘zipper’ in both rostral and caudal directions.
- This forms a Rostral and Caudal Neuropore at the Rostral and Caudal Ends of the Neural Tube where the Lumen of the Neural Tube is continuous with the wider environment
- The Rostral Neuropore closes first with the Caudal neuropore closing last

# Neural Tube Defects

- Caused by failure of neural tube to close during week 3-4.
- One of most common severe congenital malformations:
- Worldwide incidence: 2.6 per 1,000 births.
- Western Europe: 1-2 per 1,000 births.
- African-Americans: 0.35 per 1,000 births.
- Women who have had 1 NTD have an ↑ risk (10-15%) of a 2nd NTD.
- 14,000 pregnancies in UK are affected by NTD each year, 90% are terminated.
- Adding 0.4 mg folic acid to diet may ↓ NTD by as much as 70%.
- Anencephaly = Cephalic/Rostral portion of neural tube (Cranial Neuropore) fails to close, such that brain is underdeveloped, containing almost no nervous tissue.
- Affected embryos may be miscarried early in development, making it rarest form of NTD to survive gestation.
- If baby is not stillborn, will only survive a few hours or days.
- Spina Bifida = most common form of NTD in newborns, causing by the failure of Caudal Neuropore Closure
- The most severe form is myelocele, where spinal cord and meninges protrude from a spinal opening, formed by the persistence of the Caudal Neuropore.
- It is not lethal but Nerve damage caused by the Myelocele is permanent, and paralysis, bowel and bladder problems usually remain.
- Myelocele can be treated by surgery, where the Spinal Cord and Meninges are reinserted into the Body and the Opening is closed

# Neural Crest Cells and their Potency

- These are formed at boundary between neural plate and epidermis, from the Lateral Lips of the Neural Plate (Ectoderm).
- Neural crest cells break away/delaminate from epithelium either before (Cranial NCCs) or after (Trunk NCCs) neural tube is formed and migrate away from the Dorsal Midline to other parts of embryo (epithelial to mesenchyme transition/EMT).
- They divide as they migrate (both dorsally and ventrally) and whilst migrating, they are exposed to different signals depending on where they migrate to which restricts their lineage, allowing them to form different cell types depending on where they migrate to.
- EMT is important because it is similar to metastasis of cancer.
- Neural crest is unique to vertebrates.

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 10.38.02.png](%5B009%5D%20Development%20of%20the%20Brain%201%204ec192ca3e01469a843db404ef53bdac/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_10.38.02.png)

### Potency

- NCCs are Multipotent and migrate to form many different cell types:
1. Neurons, Myelinating and Non-Myelinating Schwann Cells of the CNS and glia of sensory, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems (Peripheral Nervous System).
2. Pigment producing cells of epidermis (melanocytes).
3. Adrenaline producing medulla cells of adrenal gland (Chromaffin Cells).
4. Aortic pulmonary septum and smooth muscle of great arteries.
5. Facial skeleton and connective tissue.
6. Odontoblasts (tooth dentin producing cells)

# Migration of Neural Crest Cells

### Migration of Cranial Neural Crest Cells

- Cranial neural crest cells migrate ventrally into pharyngeal arches (PA) and frontonasal process (fnp).
- Hindbrain (H) divided into segments called rhombomeres (r).
- Neural Crest cells from r1 and r2 migrate into 1st arch, r4 into 2nd arch, r6 into 3rd arch and r7 into 4th arch.
- The Different Pharyngeal Arches express different induction signals and hence, depending on which Pharyngeal Arch the NCCs migrate through, the NCCs will form different cell types that contribute to/are associated with the structures formed by their corresponding Pharyngeal Arch

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 10.39.51.png](%5B009%5D%20Development%20of%20the%20Brain%201%204ec192ca3e01469a843db404ef53bdac/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_10.39.51.png)

### Migration of Trunk Neural Crest Cells

- Neural crest cells will migrate ventrally away from the midline on either side
- They only migrate through anterior half of each somite (sclerotome).
- They do not migrate through the Posterior part of the Somite as this region secretes signals that repel the NCCs
- Some do not migrate through the entire Sclerotome and remain within it to become dorsal root ganglia, while others continue migrating ventrally through the Sclerotome and become support/Glial cells of the PNS, adrenal medulla, sympathetic ganglia and other neuronal clusters
- NCCs that migrate ventrally from the Trunk, through the substance of the Sclerotome (Ventral Pathway) will form the PNS, Heart and Adrenal Medulla whereas NCCs that migrate dorsally from the Trunk towards the Epidermis and then ventrally over the Dorsal Surface of the Somite /Ventral Surface of the Epidermis (Dorsal Pathway) will form Melanocytes

# Enteric Nervous System and Hirschsprung's Disease

### Enteric Nervous System

- Neural crest cells from vagal (Between the Hindbrain and Spinal Cord) and lumbosacral region of neural tube migrate into digestive tract where they from enteric nervous system.
- Vagal neural crest migrate posteriorly enters digestive tract in foregut (Between Oesophagus and Duodenum), before migrating caudally into midgut (Small Intestines and Caecum).
- Lumbosacral neural crest migrates directly to hindgut (Rectum) and migrate proximally to innervate more proximal regions of the Hindgut.

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 10.41.37.png](%5B009%5D%20Development%20of%20the%20Brain%201%204ec192ca3e01469a843db404ef53bdac/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_10.41.37.png)

### Hirschprung's Disease

- Frequency = 1 in 500 Live Births
- Neural crest cells fail to populate part of descending colon, which becomes constricted as it is aganglionic/lacks Enteric Ganglia.
- Caused by failure of migration of vagal neural crest cells.
- This restricts movement of bowels’ contents as bowel segments are denervated (no peristalsis of the Aganglionic Bowel Segment so Bowel Contents cannot be moved distally down the GI Tract)
- This causes Bowel Contents to accumulate proximal to the Aganglionic Segment, causing these regions of bowel to dilate (megacolon).
- This is noted soon after birth when baby fails to pass meconium.
- It can be corrected surgically by removing aganglionic/denervated portion of the Bowel and connecting the proximal and distal ganglionic segments
