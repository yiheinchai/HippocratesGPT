# [032] Forebrain II

# Medial Surface of a Hemisphere

- The corpus callosum is the great commissure of the brain
- The commissure connects the two sides of the CNS together
- It is divided into different parts (anterior to posterior):
1. Rostrum (Head)
2. Genu (Bend)
3. Body
4. Splenium
    
    ![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.42.44.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.42.44.png)
    
- It connects cerebral cortex from each hemisphere to each other
- This allows communication between the two hemispheres
- There is another commissure called the anterior commissure which connects neurons in the temporal lobe from one hemisphere to another
- The corpus callosum is cut in individuals with severe epilepsy, to prevent seizures from spreading from one hemisphere to the other
- There are very few harmful effects from this, despite having “two brains” working independently inside the same cranial cavity

The main effects are subtle

- It can manifest in each upper limb going to choose different things as the two different limbs are controlled by the two different hemispheres
- This effect can be demonstrated by feeding information only to the right hemisphere by putting it into the left visual field and the individual would be unable to say what they
are seeing as only the left hemisphere can produce speech
- In some extreme cases of epilepsy, a whole hemisphere or aspects of a hemisphere can be removed
- The child will recover, and prognosis is better with younger children
- The contralateral upper limb does not develop dexterity as it should in the hand

### Association Fibres in the Cerebral Cortex

- There are lots of association fibres deep to the cerebral cortex within the Subcortical White Matter
- They are bundles of axons that connect one area of cerebral cortex to another area of cerebral cortex
- They connect cortical areas in the same area
- Conditions like Multiple Sclerosis disrupt the conduction of information down these Bundles, reducing communication between these areas of the brain
1. Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus runs posteiorly and connects the Prefrontal Cortex anteriorly with the Occipital Cortex posteriorly, giving off lateral branches as it runs to connect nearby regions together
2. The Arcuate Fasciculus runs posteriorly along the Inferior Frontal Lobe on the Lateral Surface, near the Lateral Fissure, curves around the posterior end of the Lateral Fissure and runs along the Superior Temporal Lobe, inferior to the Lateral Fissure
- It connects the Frontal Cortex superiorly with the Temporal Cortex inferiorly
1. The Uncinate Fasciculus connects the Temporal Cortex inferiorly with the Prefrontal Cortex superiorly - It is important in conveying information regarding olfaction to the Prefrontal Cortex
2. Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus connects the Posterior Aspect of the Occipital Lobe to the Anterior Aspect of the Temporal Lobe, running along the Inferior border of the Brain
- The Left Arcuate Fasciculus is important for language as it connects parts of Wernicke's Area inferiorly with parts of Broca's Area, allowing for the integration of Language Formulation + Interpretation and Production

# Blood Supply to the Brain

- The two vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery which runs up the front of the pons
- As the Basilar Artery runs up the Pons, it gives off Lateral Pontine Arteries that supply the Pons
- Just before it bifurcates into the Posterior Cerebral Arteries, it gives off the Superior Cerebellar Artery (to supply the Superior Part of the Cerebellum, including most of the Dentate Nucleus)
- The Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Arteries arise from the Proximal Aspect of the Basillar Artery, just distal to where the Vertebral Arteries fuse and just posterior to where the Labyrinthine Artery arises
- The Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Arteries (PICA) arise from the Distal Aspect of the Vertebral Artery
- 3/4 of the Brain's Blood Supply comes from the ICAs
- It divides into two posterior cerebral arteries which go to the back of the forebrain and medial surface of the occipital lobe as well as the lower surface of the temporal lobe
- The superior cerebellar arteries are inferior to the posterior cerebral arteries and branch from the Basilar Artery just before the Posterior Cerebral Arteries arise
- The internal carotid arteries travel in the Cavernous Sinus carry on laterally into the lateral fissure as the middle cerebral arteries after giving off the Anterior Cerebral Arteries
- The anterior cerebral artery runs forward in the longitudinal fissure on the medial surface of the hemisphere
- The two anterior cerebral arteries come off the Internal Carotids, curve anteromedially and then project anteriorly. They are joined together anteriorly by the anterior communicating artery
- The internal carotid is joined to the posterior cerebral artery by the posterior communicating artery
- This forms an arterial anastomosis (Circle of Willis) at the base of the brain so that blood supply to the whole of the brain is maintained regardless of head position

### Areas Supplied by the Middle Cerebral Artery

- The middle cerebral artery runs along in the lateral fissure
- It supplies the entire lateral surface of the hemisphere, (brown area) except a thin region that runs around the lateral margin of the Brain in the Sagittal Palne

This includes:

1. Broca’s area (dominant - mainly left)
2. Wernicke’s area (dominant - mainly left)
3. The motor and somatosensory area for the hands and upper limb
- Middle cerebral artery cortical lesions therefore cause contralateral upper limb effects and inability to comprehend, formulate and produce speech
    
    ![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.47.55.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.47.55.png)
    

### Areas Supplied by the Anterior Cerebral Artery

- On the medial surface of the hemisphere, the anterior cerebral artery supplies most of the medial surface
- It winds round the superior surface of the corpus callosum, running posteriorly
- This includes:
1. The paracentral lobule which comprises the motor and somatosensory regions for the lower limb
2. The supplementary motor area
3. Prefrontal cortex
- Lesions are thus associated with contralateral lower limb problems

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.50.13.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.50.13.png)

### Areas Supplied by the Posterior Cerebral Artery

- The posterior cerebral artery is wound round the inferior edge of the midbrain
- It gives branches to the medial surfaces of the occipital lobe involved in visual functions
- It also supplies a large part of the lower surface of the temporal lobe with branches
- Lesions are thus associated with defects in the contralateral visual field (there might be little impacts to Macular/Central vision as the Posterior end of the Occipital Lobe receives some blood from the Middle Cerebral Artery)

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.49.55.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.49.55.png)

- As the lesion here is in the left occipital lobe, the right visual field of both eyes will be affected

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.50.38.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.50.38.png)

# Aneurysms of Arteries Supplying the Brain and Alzheimer's

### Aneurysms

- There can be aneurysms of arteries supplying the brain
- They usually affect arteries within or near the circle of Willis
- A berry aneurysm is a thin-walled outpouching
- Aneurysms of cerebral vessels are fairly common and disastrous if they burst
- If they rupture, a subarachnoid haemorrhage with blood in the CSF will result

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.51.33.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.51.33.png)

- Neurosurgeons may place a clip on the neck of the aneurysm to prevent blood from bursting out
- Radiologists fill them up by inserting a cannula into the vessel, entering the aneurysm from within the vessel and filling the aneurysm with a coil, which is more effective as it is less invasive

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.52.20.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.52.20.png)

### Alzheimer's Disease

- The gyri shrink and the sulci and ventricles enlarge as the cerebral cortex is lost due to degeneration of neurones
- There is shrinkage of the forebrain and brain tissue is lost
- There should be no spaces between gyri in a healthy brain
- The ventricles tend to enlarge with a loss of brain matter

**Pathology of Alzheimer’s Disease:**

- This typically involves amyloid plaques (outside neurons) and neurofibrillary tangles (inside neurons)
- It was previously thought that β-amyloid deposits indirectly caused all of the problems
- Treatments targeting β-amyloid have been largely unsuccessful
- Nowadays it is thought that amyloid may trigger changes in tau protein which then goes on to spread throughout and between neurons
- Alzheimer’s can be detected or predicted reasonably early on, as indicated by the hippocampal formation being thin on MRI scans or by Apolipoprotein E4 in blood tests
    
    ![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.57.32.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_13.57.32.png)
    
- However, development of disease cannot be stopped
- Alongside anatomical changes to the Brain, Alzheimer's is characterised by the loss of Cholinergic Supply of the Cerebral Cortex by the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert
- The only current treatment for Alzheimer’s disease involves neurons found in the Basal nucleus of Meynert which is found in the basal part of the brain
- This is found just above the anterior perforated substance (next to optic chiasm)
- The nucleus basalis of Meynert is the main cholinergic nucleus for the whole neocortex whilst the Septal Nuclei are the main cholinergic nuclei for the hippocampus in the temporal lobe
- It sends cholinergic fibres all over the neocortex which speeds up processing and increase cortical activity
- Early on in Alzheimer’s disease, these 2 nuclei and their neurons die, so the efficiency of processing slows down, resulting in the cognitive deficits seen in early Alzheimer's Disease
- The only treatment so far is anticholinesterases so there is increased ACh, which may improve symptoms for a short period of time but does not alter the course of the disease

# Basal Ganglia

- These are nuclei found deep in the brain with motor functions (not exclusively)
- Diseases in the basal ganglia result in dyskinesias, which are problems with motor function (abnormality or impairment of voluntary movement)
- Chorea = a neurological disorder characterised by jerky involuntary movements. It is a type of dyskinesia
- Most of the Basal Ganglia is in the forebrain, except for the Substantia Nigra which is in the Midbrain

The diseases include:

- Huntington’s disease where the corpus striatum (Putamen and Caudate Nucleus) degenerate. It is inherited
- Parkinson’s disease where the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain degenerate
- This results in difficulties initiating movement
- There is also resting tremor
- Emotional control of facial muscles is lost resulting in a “mask-like” face
- Subthalamic nucleus lesions result in hemiballismus, resulting in undesired movements of the limbs
    
    ![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.02.36.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.02.36.png)
    

### Nuclei of the Basal Ganglia

1. Globus Pallidus
2. Putamen
3. Caudate nucleus
4. Subthalamic nucleus
5. Substantia nigra
- The lentiform nucleus is the putamen and globus pallidus
- The neostriatum = putamen + caudate nucleus = striatum

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.03.43.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.03.43.png)

# Corpus Striatum

- This is grey matter deep in the hemisphere
- Corpus striatum = striped body
- The largest parts of the basal ganglia are called the corpus striatum which is grey matter deep in the hemisphere
- It consists of the putamen and caudate nucleus

**Caudate Nucleus**

- The caudate nucleus has a large anterior head, a body and long posterior tail which goes down to the temporal lobe.
- The tip of the tail of the caudate nucleus is not part of the basal ganglia

**Amygdala**

- The amygdala sits on the end of the tail of the caudate nucleus and is found inferior to the Putamen and Nucleus Accumbens
- The amygdala is a phylogenetically old aspect of the brain which is important for emotional responses and attaching emotional significance to a stimulus.
- This role is particularly carried out by the Basolateral nucleus
- It receives nociceptive input whilst information regarding memory goes to and from the Amygdala
- It is found next to the olfactory cortex within the Uncus
- If the amygdala is ablated bilaterally, people become very placid (calm and unemotional)
- It has notable connections with the hippocampal formation, dorsomedial thalamus and medial prefrontal cortex
- It is also important for some aspects of memory
- Its outputs include fibres passing to the cerebral cortex, limbic association cortex, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex

**Putamen and Nucleus Accumbens**

- The putamen is found deep to the insula, just posterior to the Nucleus Accumbens and Head of the Caudate Nucleus, in the middle of the Hemisphere and surrounded by the Caudate Nucleus
- Just anteroventral/anteroinferior to the head of the caudate nucleus, is the nucleus accumbens
- This is the limbic part of the corpus striatum and is related to behavioural roles, connecting emotions and movement
- Cocaine raises dopamine levels here
- It relates to reward pathways and hence, is important in addiction

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.05.32.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.05.32.png)

### Axial Scan Showing the Basal Ganglia

- The head of the caudate nucleus is a circular structure that can be seen bulging into anterior horn of the lateral ventricle
- The insular cortex is grey matter found superficial to the putamen and is found embedded within the lateral fissure
- The putamen and caudate nucleus are effectively the same structure as the head of the Caudate Nucleus is continuous anteriorly with the Putamen (hence the same colour on scans). They are divided up by a strip of white matter
- The Globus Pallidus and Putamen are visible and strips of grey matter, running lateral to the Thalamus and posterior to the Head of the Caudate Nucleus
- The globus pallidus is medial to the putamen and stains much lighter than the Head of the Caudate Nucleus and Putamen
- The head of the caudate nucleus and the putamen is called the neostriatum or striatum
- The putamen and globus pallidus are functionally different but closely related. Together, they are called the lentiform nucleus
- The thalamus is not part of the basal ganglia but is closely associated the basal ganglia and can be seen either side of the narrow 3rd Ventricle

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.06.48.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.06.48.png)

# Internal Capsule

- The diagram below illustrates the region in the pink box
- Just deep to the insular cortex is a thin of grey matter called the claustrum (it is hard to distinguish on scans)
- The claustrum has connections with most of the neocortex/cerebral cortex
- It may have important role in consciousness
- The extreme capsule is white matter between the claustrum and insular cortex
- The Extreme Capsule Contains fibres that connect different regions of the Cerebral Cortex, notably the Temporal and Frontal Lobes and hence, is involved in communication between Broca's and Wernicke's Areas
- The external capsule is white matter between the putamen and claustrum
- The External Capsule contains axons going between the Cerebral Cortex and the Striatum
- The thalamus is medial to globus pallidus
- The two lateral ventricles are separated by the septum pellucidum
- The thalamus forms the lateral walls of the third ventricle

**Internal Capsule**

- The internal capsule is a V-shaped band of white matter that passes through the basal ganglia and separates some of the structures from each other.
- The internal capsule is a very important site of strokes
- The internal capsule contains axons going to and from cerebral cortex
- In horizontal section, it is described as having:
1. An anterior limb between the head of the caudate nucleus and the lentiform nucleus
2. A genu (bend) - This is found just lateral to the Lateral Ventricles
3. A posterior limb between the lentiform nucleus and thalamus
- The posterior limb of the internal capsule contains all the descending motor fibres for the contralateral side of the body
- This is any descending motor tract from the cerebral cortex
- This means a capsular stroke can completely paralyse the patient on the contralateral side of the body (hemiplegia)
    
    ![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.09.32.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.09.32.png)
    
- The head of the caudate nucleus bulges into the lateral ventricle
- The anterior limb of the internal capsule contains fibres connecting the dorsomedial thalamus to the prefrontal cortex, involved in worrying and planning
- These fibres can relate to worrying
- A unilateral lesion here has much less severe effects than a unilateral lesion in the posterior limb of the internal capsule

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.10.28.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.10.28.png)

# Connections of the Basal Ganglia

### 1) Excitatory Input from the Cerebral Cortex to the Striatum

- There are neurons in the cerebral cortex that project to the striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen)
- These are particularly but not entirely from the motor areas of the cerebral cortex
- These fibres are excitatory and from many areas of the cerebral cortex
- Below the thalamus is another bit of basal ganglia called the subthalamic nucleus
- The substantia nigra is in the midbrain and is the only aspect of the basal ganglia not in the forebrain
    
    ![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.12.22.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.12.22.png)
    

### 2) Output from the Stratum Goes to the Globus Pallidus and is Inhibitory

- The corpus striatum contains mostly medium spiny GABAergic neurons
- These project to the globus pallidus
- The output is entirely inhibitory but does not completely inhibit the Globus Pallidus

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.13.31.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.13.31.png)

### 3) Output from the Globus Pallidus to the Thalamus

- The globus pallidus is the main output nucleus from the basal ganglia, producing an inhibitory output
- Inhibitory Axons from the Globus Pallidus project to the thalamus where they inhibits neurons in the thalamus which excite the motor cortex and hence, determine the likelihood of movement
- The neurones come from the medial part/apex of the triangularly shaped globus pallidus

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.15.00.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.15.00.png)

# Direct and Indirect Pathways - Quite Difficult

### Direct Pathway

- One of the pathways through the basal ganglia is direct
1. The cerebral cortex sends neurons to excite neurons in the corpus striatum
2. The inhibitory neurons in the corpus striatum project to the internal/medial part of the globus pallidus
3. The neurons from the globus pallidus inhibit neurons in the thalamus which would otherwise excite motor cortex 
4. However, as the neurons in the internal part of globus pallidus are inhibited by inhibitory neurons from the Corpus Striatum, there is less inhibition of the thalamic neurons leading to a disinhibition
- The effect of the direct pathway is that the neurons from the direct pathway disinhibits neurons in the thalamus by inhibiting the Globus Pallidus, which means these thalamic neurones are more active so that there is more activation of the motor cortex and it promotes movement.
- Overall, the direct pathway promotes movement
- The direct pathway is probably used to select and decide an appropriate motor programme to produce the movement that the cerebral cortex wants (Initiates movement)

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.17.54.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.17.54.png)

### Indirect Pathway

1. Excitatory neurons from the cerebral cortex go to the striatum to excite it.
2. The Striatum sends Inhibitory Neurons to the external part of the globus pallidus
3. The external part of the globus pallidus sends inhibitory neurons that go to the subthalamic nucleus 
4. The subthalamic neurons excite neurons from the internal part of globus pallidus, which inhibit thalamic neurons
- In this pathway, excitation of the Striatum increases inhibition of the external part of Globus Pallidus, decreasing inhibition of the Subthalamic Nucleus. This increases excitatory output from the Subthalamic Nucleus to the Internal Part of the Globus Pallidus, inhibiting thalamic neurones , inhibiting the Motor Cortex and hence movement
- This means there is inhibition of the excitatory neurons from the thalamus to the motor cortex
- There is inhibition of fibres from the external part of the Globus Pallidus that normally prevent the subthalamic nucleus from exciting the internal part of the globus pallidus
- Overall, the indirect pathway makes movement less likely
- The indirect pathway brings the movement that the cerebral cortex wants to an end

# Substantia Nigra and Parkinson's

- This is the only part of the basal ganglia which is outside of the forebrain
- There is a part of the substantia nigra which is compact and referred to as the substantia nigra pars compacta
- This contains dopaminergic neurons
- This degenerates in Parkinson’s
- 70% of these neurons must degenerate in order for symptoms to manifest
- This results in difficulty initiating movement

MTPT:

- This was a designer drug to mimic opiates
- It resulted in acute substantia nigra pars compacta toxicity and resulted in Parkinson’s like syndromes
- It is a specific toxin for dopaminergic neurons
- It is useful for understanding the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease
- For many people, the first neurons that degenerate in Parkinson's Disease are found in the GI Plexi, with the pathology spreading to the Dorsal Nucleus of the Vagus, to other Pontine Nuclei and eventually, to the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta. Hence, its origin in the GI Tract means that Gut Bacteria can influence the development of Parkinson's

- Dopamine from the substantia nigra excites the direct pathway and inhibits the indirect pathway, with both of these effects making movement more likely
- The treatment of Parkinson’s disease, where there is a loss of dopaminergic neurons is to give L-DOPA
- This is a dopamine precursor which can cross the blood brain barrier
- It works but the dose has to be increased progressively after treatment for a few years
- This often results in unwanted movements and dyskinesias (E.g Athetoid Movements - Involuntary writhing movements of the hand)
- It does however work well to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s

### Deep Brain Stimulation as a Treatment for Parkinsons

- Electrodes can be used to stimulate the subthalamic nucleus or internal part of the globus pallidus
- This does no harm to the patients and has a beneficial effect
- This is only effective if the patient is still somewhat responsive to L-DOPA and when successful, it increases the effectiveness of L-DOPA in treating Parkinson's Sx
- This is paradoxical as the subthalamic nucleus and internal part of globus pallidus normally inhibits movement
- The side effects of deep brain stimulations result in behavioural changes
- However, these behavioural changes only appear when the stimulation is present
- The basal ganglia also have cognitive functions, and therefore psychiatric issues are seen in many Parkinson’s patients
- There is difficulty beyond motor issues

# Blood Supply of the Internal Capsule

- Internal Capsule = Main pathway to and from the Cerebral Cortex and hence, is vital for Voluntary functions
- This shows the internal carotid becoming the middle cerebral artery within the Circle of Willis, which runs around the stem of the Lateral Fissure outside the brainstem
- As it runs around the stem of the Lateral Fissure, the middle cerebral artery gives off striate arteries which supply the posterior limb of the internal capsule as well as the corpus striatum (Caudate Nucleus and Putamen)
- They pass through the anterior perforated substance to do this
- The striate arteries (lenticulostriate arteries) come off the Middle Cerebral Artery at right angles and are very fine, which can increase the risk of damage to these arteries (E.g Haemorrhage or Thrombose)
- Lesions in these arteries result in contralateral paralysis as the posterior limb of the internal capsule contains all descending motor tracts (Hemiplegic Stroke)
- The Thalamus is supplied by the Posterior Cerebral Artery
- Capsular strokes are thus very serious

# The Limbic Loop Through the Basal Ganglia

- At this level the putamen and caudate nucleus are continuous
- The nucleus accumbens can also be seen

![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.28.25.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.28.25.png)

- This image below is a PET scan showing the activation of the nucleus accumbens when someone has taken cocaine
- Cocaine results in dopamine release, causing the activation of Dopamine receptors in the Nucleus Accumbens
- The nucleus accumbens is the limbic part of the corpus striatum relating to reward pathways and is important for addictive behaviour
- The limbic loop through the basal ganglia goes from the nucleus accumbens → ventral pallidum → dorsomedial thalamus → prefrontal cortex (Important for personality and emotions)
- Ventral Pallidum = Part of Globus Pallidus found below the Anterior Commissure
- DOPA agonists have been developed for Parkinson’s but have implications in risk taking behaviour
- These appear to be particularly good at activating the limbic circuit of the basal ganglia
    
    ![%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.29.53.png](%5B032%5D%20Forebrain%20II%20181cd69f05ca48ec810520728ac1d524/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.29.53.png)
    
- The nucleus accumbens receives dopaminergic fibres from a region of the midbrain called the ventral tegmental area.
- This is found just posteromedial to the Substantia Nigra, in the region of the Midbrain posterior to the Fissure between the 2 Crus Cerebri
- In Parkinson's Disease, dopaminergic fibres from the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta and Ventral Tegmental Area both die early, with other monoaminergic neurones also die later on, such as those in the Locus Cereleus (Impacts Cognition). As these Nuclei regulate the functions of other areas of the brain, Parkinson's can have wider effects than just on motor
- The ventral tegmental area also projects directly to the prefrontal cortex which is the main behaviour area of the brain which is involved in reward pathways

# Summary of Movement Pathways and Motor Control

- The neocortex has the idea for movement
- This can be seen by the fact that your signature is the same regardless of how big it is when you write it
- Then the direct pathway through the basal ganglia facilitates an appropriate pattern of motor activity to achieve the desired movement
- The information is sent via the thalamus to the supplementary motor area which then communicates with the primary motor cortex which controls motor neurons via the corticospinal tracts
- The cerebellum identifies and corrects errors in the movement
- Finally, the indirect pathway brings an end to the movement

# Braak Staging of Parkinson's Disease

- Many Neurodegenerative Diseases (Including Parkinson's) spreads from neuron-to-neuron across synapses
- Parkinson's Disease is characterised Histologically by the Presence of Lewy Bodies within Neurons inside Neurons
- These are first found in neurons in the GI Tract, spreading up to the Dorsal Nucleus of the Vagus (which projects to the GI Tract) and then to other Nuclei in the Brainstem and finally, the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta of the Midbrain.
- After this, Lewy Bodies spready into the Cerebral Cortex where they cause degeneration, explaining why Dementia commonly develops after an individual develops Parkinson's Disease
