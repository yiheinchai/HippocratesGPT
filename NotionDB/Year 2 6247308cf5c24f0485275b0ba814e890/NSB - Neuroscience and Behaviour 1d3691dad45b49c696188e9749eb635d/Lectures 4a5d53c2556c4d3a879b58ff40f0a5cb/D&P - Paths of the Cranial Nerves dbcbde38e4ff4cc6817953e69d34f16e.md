# Cranial Nerve I

- This may be considered to be an extension of the Brain
1. Around 20 or so Olfactory Nerve Bundles pass superiorly from the Nasal Cavity through the Cribriform Plate of the Ethmoid in the Roof of the Nose to enter the Anterior Cranial Fossa, where the Olfactory Bulb is found (Swollen anterior end of the Olfactory Tract)
- These innervate the Upper Part of the Nasal Cavity
- Anosmia/Loss of Smell could indicate a Fracture of the Cribriform Plate (Damaging the Olfactory Nerves) or a Neuroma/Meningioma compressing the Olfactory Bulb/Tract.
- Anosmia is also common after URT Infections and Colds
- The Olfactory Nerve is tested by asking Px to identify strong smells in each nostril, one at a time

# Cranial Nerve II

1. This passes posteriorly from the back of the Eye through the Orbit and then through the Orbital Canal in the Sphenoid Bone
2. Nerve Impulses from the Lateral Part of the Retina/Visual Field project to the Ipsilateral Visual Cortex whereas Nerve Impulses from the Medial Part of the Retina/Visual Field Decussate in the Optic Chiasm to project to the Contralateral Visual Cortex
- The Optic Chiasm is located anterior to the Pituitary Stalk in the Anterior Cranial Fossa, between the Terminal Segments of both Internal Carotid Arteries
- Bitemporal Hemianopia occurs when a Pituitary Tumour presses on the Centre of the Optic Chiasm
- Here, The Nasal/Medial Parts of the Retina that receive light from the Temporal/Lateral Visual Fields are insensitive to light, causing the Loss of the Lateral Visual Fields bilaterally due to damage to the Decussating Optic Fibre Axons from the Medial Retina
- Nasal Hemianopia occurs if there is compression of the Lateral Aspects of the Optic Chiasm
- Here, there is loss of the Nasal/Medial Visual Field of the Ipsilateral Eye due to Damage of Non-Decussating Fibres that pass through the Optic Chiasm from the Lateral Retina of the Ipsilateral Eye which receives light from the Nasal/Medial Visual Field

# Cranial Nerve III

- Supplies all Extraocular Muscles except Lateral Rectus, Superior Oblique and the Involuntary/Autonomic Component of Levator Palpebrae Superioris
1. It arises from the Anteroinferior Surface of the Midbrain, between the Posterior Cerebral and Superior Cerebellar Arteries 
2. It runs into the Cleft of the Dura between the Tentorial Notch and the Dura over the Petroclinoid Ligament within the Middle Cranial Fossa
3. It then runs anteriorly, in the Lateral Wall of the Cavernous Sinus and through the Medial Aspect of the Superior Orbital Fissure to enter the Orbit within the Tendinous Ring
- This can be tested to ask the Px to look side to side, up and down with the Eye initially placed medially and then initially placed laterally

# Cranial Nerve IV

1. This small thread-like Nerve arises from the Posterior Surface of the Midbrain, running anteriorly under the Tentorial Notch in the Posterior Cranial Fossa
2. It then passes inferolateral to CN III to enter the Dura of the Lateral Wall of the Cavernous Sinus
3. It then enters the Orbit via the Lateral Aspect of the Superior Orbital Fissure (Lateral to the Tendinous Ring)
4. It then Passes medially to supply the Superior Oblique Muscle
- It can be tested by Asking a Px to look medially (towards their nose) and then downwards from this medial gaze

![png-clipart-oculomotor-nerve-optic-nerve-cranial-nerves-human-eye-eye-people-human-eye.png](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/png-clipart-oculomotor-nerve-optic-nerve-cranial-nerves-human-eye-eye-people-human-eye.png)

# Cranial Nerve V

1. The Trigeminal Nerve leaves the anterolateral surface of the Pons and passes anteriorly to the Petrous Crest, over which it runs with an extension of the Dura and Arachnoid from the Posterior Cranial Fossa
2. Here, in a depression on the Apex of the Petrous Temporal Bone (Meckel's Cave), the Sensory Trigeminal Ganglion Is found.
3. Three Large Sensory Divisions extend from this Ganglion and the Motor Part of the Nerve now joints the Mandibular Division/Nerve (CN V3)

![Trigeminal-Nerve2.jpeg](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/Trigeminal-Nerve2.jpeg)

![Trigeminal-Nerve3.jpeg](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/Trigeminal-Nerve3.jpeg)

### Cranial Nerve V1 (Opthalmic Division)

1. The Ophthalmic Division runs through the Lateral Wall of the Cavernous Sinus.
2. It then divides into Frontal, Lacrimal and Nasociliary Branches
- These are sensory to the Conjunctiva, Skin of the Upper Eyelid, Bridge of the Nose, Forehead and to the Cornea and Sclera via the Long and Short Ciliary Branches of the Nasociliary Nerve
- These afferent branches can be tested for touch, temperature, pressure and pain, where appropriate and by appropriate means, over the Dermatomes and the Skin of the Forehead and Face associated with CN V1

![Anatomical-Course-of-the-Ophthalmic-Nerve.jpg](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/Anatomical-Course-of-the-Ophthalmic-Nerve.jpg)

![Maxillary-nerve.jpeg](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/Maxillary-nerve.jpeg)

### Cranial Nerve V2 (Maxillary Division)

- This division of the Trigeminal Nerve also runs in the Lateral Wall of the Cavernous Sinus alongside the Ophthalmic Division
- It is the Sensory Nerve to the Midface, Nasal Cavity and Palate as well as to the Lower Eyelid and Associated Palpebral Conjunctiva via the Infraorbital Nerve
1. CN V2 also runs in the Lateral wall of the Cavernous Sinus
2. In the Pterygopalatine Fossa, it gives off the Infraorbital, Greater Palatine and Nasopalatine Nerves
- These run anteriorly towards the cheek, inferiorly into the Hard and Soft Palate and into the nose and roof of the Nasopharynx respectively
1. In the Infratemporal Fossa, CN V2 gives off the Alveolar Branches, which runs inferiorly to the Maxillary Teeth and Maxillary Antrum
- CN V2 is entirely sensory, but each of its branches pick up Postganglionic PSNS Secretomotor Fibres from the Greater Superficial Petrosal Branch of CN VII that have synapsed in the Pterygopalatine Ganglion
1. These Fibres travel with the branches of CN V2 to glands in the Nasal Mucosa and on the Palate
- The Maxillary Nerve can be tested through response to touch, pressure, pain and temperature over its distribution on the cheek, temple, upper lip and lower eyelid

![3-Figure1-1.png](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/3-Figure1-1.png)

### Cranial Nerve V3 (Mandibular Division)

1. This leaves the Middle Cranial Fossa via the Foramen Ovale and enters the roof of the Infratemporal Fossa
- Its Anterior Division gives motor branches to all the Muscles of Mastication and to the Tensor Tympani and Tensor Veli Palatini
1. This Anterior Division also gives off the Long Buccal Branch, which runs to the inside of the Cheek, and another small Spinosus branch, which ascends with the Middle Meningeal Artery - This supplies the Mucosa in the Middle Cranial Fossa and helps to supply the Mucous Membranes of the Mastoid Air Cells
2. The Posterior Division divides into the Auriculotemporal Nerve, Inferior Alveolar Nerve, The Lingual Nerve and the Mylohyoid Nerve to the to the Mylohyoid and Anterior Belly of the Digastric
3. The Auricotemporal Nerve runs laterally, splitting to pass either side of the Middle Meningeal Artery. 
- It supplies the Skin of the Temple, Scalp, Auricle and Anterior Wall of the External Auditory Meatus
- The Auricotemporal Nerve also picks up Postganglionic PSNS Fbres form the Lesser Superficial Petrosal Branch of CN IX that have synapse in the Otic Ganglion and carried them to the Parotid Gland
1. The Inferior Alveolar Nerve provides sensory innervation to the Pulp Cavity of the Teeth and then runs anteriorly to emerge through the Mental Foramen as the Mental Nerve to supply the skin and Mucous Membrane of the Lower Lip and the Skin over the Chin
2. The Lingual Nerve runs over the Lateral Surface of the Medial Pterygoid and then runs on to the bone of the Mandible, where it lies just beneath the Third Molar Tooth Roots
3. It then passes medially across the floor of the mouth, hooking underneath the Submandibular Duct, before it runs up into the substance of the tongue
- The Lingual Nerve supplies general sensation to the anterior 2/3rds of the Tongue
1. The Lingual Nerve is joined by the Chorda Tympani of CN VII as it leaves the Tympanic Cavity via the Petrotympanic Fissure
2. The Chorda Tympani carries Preganglionic PSNS Nerves to the Submandibular Ganglion, which synapse here
3. Postganglionic Fibres then continue in the Chorda Tympani as secretomotor nerves to the Submandibular and Sublingual Glands
- Taste sensation from the Anterior 2/3rds of the Tongue joins the Chorda Tympani and runs back to the Facial Nerve in the Tympanic Cavity
- The Motor Component of the Mandibular Nerve can be tested by asking a Px to bite their teeth together bilaterally and to protrude the lower Jaw
- The Sensory component of the Nerve can be tested by varying forms of sensation over the dermatome of this nerve in the lower face

![070417_0934_MandibularN1.jpeg](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/070417_0934_MandibularN1.jpeg)

# Cranial Nerve VI

1. This emerges from the Brain from the Anteroinferior Aspect of the Pons
2. It runs a long way up the Clivus of the Basilar Part of the Occipital Bone before it pierces the Dura 
3. It then runs under the Petroclinoid Ligament and into the Cavernous Sinus
- Its long Intracranial Course means it is vulnerable to Injury
1. It then accompanies the Internal Carotid Artery through the Cavernous Sinus to enter the Orbit through the Medial Aspect of the Superior Orbital Fissure (within the Fibrous Ring)
- This can be tested by asking the Px to follow and look at an object held out to the edge of the Temporal/Lateral Visual Field with the ipsilateral eye

# Cranial Nerve VII

1. This emerges from the Brain between the Pons and medulla, passing laterally into the Internal Acoustic Meatus to eventually reach the Muscles of Facial Expression
2. After innervating these muscles, it continues laterally in the Internal Acoustic Meatus until it approaches the Medial Wall of the Tympanic Cavity
3. Here, its sensory route has a Ganglion called the Geniculate Ganglion which contains afferent cell bodies
4. Close to this Ganglion, It gives off the Greater Petrosal Nerve
5. The Facial Nerve has a bend (genu) where it turns posteriorly from laterally within its own bony canal to travel inferiorly down the Posterior Wall of the Tympanic Cavity, still within this canal 
6. Just after it enters its bony canal through the Posterior Wall of the Tympanic Cavity (Petrous Temporal Bone), it gives off the Nerve to Stapedius
7. Just before it leaves the skull via the Stylomastoid Foramen, it gives off the Chorda Tympani,
8. The Chorda Tympani runs anteriorly over the Long Handle of the Malleus (across the Pars Flaccida) to leave the Skull Base via the Petrotympanic Fissure
9. After the Chorda Tympani leaves through the Petrotympanic Fissure, it immediately joins the Lingual Nerve
10. CN VII then leaves the skull via the Stylomastoid Foramen to enter the Parotid Gland and run anteriorly through the substance of the gland superficially
11. At the Anterior Margin of this Gland, it emerges as Temporal, Zygomatic, Buccal, Marginal Mandibular and Cervical Branches
- These are all motor to the muscles of Facial Expression
- CN VII can be tested by asking a Px to blink, screw their eyes up, show their teeth and/or whistle

![facial-nerve-1.jpeg](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/facial-nerve-1.jpeg)

# Cranial Nerve VIII

1. This emerges from the Brain close to CN VII, between the Pons and the Medulla, before passing into the Internal Acoustic Meatus
2. Here, it runs with CN VII and the Labyrinthine Artery (Terminal Branch of the Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery which runs towards the Cochlea and Vestibular Apparatus)
3. The Nerve fibres of the Cochlear Division have their cell bodies in the Spiral Ganglia within the Modiolus of the Cochlea
4. Nerve Fibres of the Vestibular Division have their cell bodies in the Internal Acoustic Meatus
- To test the function of the Vestibular Division of CN VIII, Ask the Px to stand with their feet together and eyes closed - If the Px has a Lesion, they will sway/fall to the Ipsilateral Side as the Lesion
- Testing hearing using a tuning fork will distinguish between Sensorineural Hearing Loss (Due to Cochlear Nerve Lesion/Damage to Inner Ear Structures) or Conductive Hearing Loss (Due to impaired conduction between the External Acoustic Meatus and the Footplate of the Stapes)
- In Conductive Hearing Loss, Bone conduction is better than Air Conduction so a sound produced by a Tuning fork will sound louder when the ringing fork is placed on the Mastoid Process than when the Fork is held near the External Acoustic Meatus.
- In Sensorineural Hearing Loss, Bone Conduction is identical to Air Conduction so there will be no difference in the volume of the sound heard when the tuning fork is placed on the Mastoid Process and when it is held near the External Acoustic Meatus

# Cranial nerve IX

1. This leaves the skull via the Jugular Foramen in the Posterior Cranial Fossa
- This has 2 Sensory Ganglia (Superior and Inferior Ganglion) which contains afferent cell bodies.
- The Superior Ganglion is found within the Jugular Foramen and the Inferior Ganglion is found inferior to it
1. CN IX runs inferiorly between the Internal and External Carotid Arteries with Stylopharyngeus (which it supplies)
2. It then passes between the Superior and Middle Constrictor Muscles to enter the lateral aspect of the Pharynx deep to the Palatine Tonsil Bed to run to the back of the tongue
3. The Tympanic Branch from the Inferior Sensory Ganglion passes up, into the Middle Ear Cavity within the Skull and then reforms on the Medial Wall of the Tympanic Cavity as the Lesser Superficial Petrosal Nerve
4. This runs out through the front of the Petrous Temporal Bone and then inferiorly, out of the Skull again through the Foramen Ovale
5. CN IX then gives off the Carotid Sinus Nerve, which supplies Baroreceptors in the Carotid Sinus and Chemoreceptors in the Carotid Body
6. The Terminal Branches of CN IX are the Pharyngeal Branches, which contribute sensory nerve fibres to the Pharyngeal Plexus
- CN IX is sensory to the back of the Oropharynx
- This nerve can be tested by stimulating the back of the Oropharynx to produce the 'gag reflex'

![Glossopharyngeal-nerve-Course.jpeg](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/Glossopharyngeal-nerve-Course.jpeg)

# Cranial Nerve X

1. It passes out of the skull via the Jugular Foramen
- It contains 2 Ganglia (Jugular and Nodose Ganglion, moving inferiorly) which contain Afferent cell bodies
1. It then passes down the neck in the Carotid Sheath, first with the Internal Carotid Artery and then with the Common Carotid Artery 
2. Its first branch is the Auricular Branch that runs up through the Petrosal Temporal Bone, back into the skull, to supply the skin behind the ear and the Posterior wall of the External Acoustic Meatus 
- Irritating this nerve (E.g in operations involving the ear) may cause vomiting via a Vagal Reflex
1. The Second Branches are the Pharyngeal Branches of the Vagus, which contribute to the Pharyngeal Plexus and supply the Levator Veli Palatini
2. The Third Branch is the Superior Laryngeal Nerve, which arises high up in the neck and descends behind the Internal Carotid Artery
3. It then divides into the External Laryngeal Nerve (Motor to Cricothyroid) and Internal Laryngeal Nerve (Sensory to the Laryngeal Mucosa, above the Level of the Vocal Folds)
4. The Main Vagal Trunk passes into the Thoracic Inlet and can be found in the Thorax, lying against the Trachea on the Rich and on the Aortic Arch on the Left
5. The Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve arises here and loops under the Subclavian Artery (RHS) and Aortic Arch (LHS) - They supply all intrinsic muscles of the Larynx except Cricothyroid and sensation to the Laryngeal Mucosa below the Level of the Vocal Folds
- CN X can be tested by Asking the Px to raise their soft palate (by saying 'Ah'), to swallow and that sensation to the Piriform Fossa and Epiglottis is intact

![Vagus-nerve-course-and-connections.jpeg](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/Vagus-nerve-course-and-connections.jpeg)

# Cranial Nerve XI

1. This arises from the Upper Cervical Spinal Segments (Spinal Accessory) and the Medulla Oblongata (Cranial Accesory)
2. The Spinal Accessory Nerve ascends to enter the Posterior Cranial Fossa via the Foramen Magnum
3. Both the Spinal and Cranial Part then leave the Posterior Cranial Fossa via the Jugular Foramen (Alongside CN IX and CN X)
4. The Fibres of the Cranial Accessory Nerve immediately join CN X and are distributed to the Pharyngeal Plexus (On the surface of the Middle Pharyngeal Constrictor) and to the Laryngeal Nerves
5. The Spinal Accessor Nerve quickly runs into the deep surface of the Sternocleidomastoid, which it supplies with Motor Fibres 
6. It then runs out of this muscle, across the Posterior Triangle of the Neck and into the Trapezius, which it also innervates
- The Spinal Accessory Nerve can be tested by asking a Px to shrug their shoulders against resistance and to turn their face away from the palm of your hand (can be used to judge the force of Trapezius and Sternocleidomastoid respectively)
- Turning their face to one side tests the function of the Contralateral Sternocleidomastoid

![Accessory-nerve1.jpeg](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/Accessory-nerve1.jpeg)

# Cranial Nerve XII

1. The Hypoglossal Nerve leaves the Posterior Cranial Fossa via the Foramen Magnum, but then enters the Hypoglossal Canal, just above the Occipital Condyle
2. CN XII then swings laterally behind CN X and both the Internal and External Carotid Arteries.
3. At the level of the Hyoid Bone, CN XII runs anteriorly and joins the Lingual Artery quite superficially, just lateral to the Hyoid
4. It then runs anteriorly and over the Lateral aspect of Hyoglossus in the floor of the Mouth
5. Branches of the Hypoglossal Nerve run to innervate each of the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Muscles of the Tongue (Except Palatoglossus)
- This nerve can be tested by asking a Px to stick out their tongue, with the tongue deviating to the side of the CN XII Lesion if present

![hypoglossal-Nerve-1.jpeg](D&P%20-%20Paths%20of%20the%20Cranial%20Nerves%20dbcbde38e4ff4cc6817953e69d34f16e/hypoglossal-Nerve-1.jpeg)
