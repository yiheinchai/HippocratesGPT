# [044] Sensory Transduction and Receptors

# Sensory Input to Spinal Cord

- All somatosensory input (not including Visual and Auditory Information) to spinal cord arrives via axons of sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG):
1. Cutaneous (e.g. touch and nociception/pain).
- Nociception = High Level, Strong Sensory Information that tends to produce tissue damage
- Pain = Interpretation of Noxious Stimuli by the Cerebral Cortex
- All Painful Stimuli are Nociceptive Stimuli but the converse is not true
1. Proprioceptive (e.g. muscle length).
2. Visceral (e.g. enteric pain and arterial O₂).
- This information then enters the Dorsal Horn where it can terminate on Interneurons or enter the White Matter to enter Ascending Sensory Tracts (E.g Dorsal Columns)

### Dorsal Root Ganglia

- Different classes of sensory neurons (E.g Mix of Large Myelinated and Small Unmyelinated Fibres) surrounded by satellite cells.
- This contains the Sensory Soma with an Axon that bifurcates into a peripheral axon that extends to Peripheral Receptors and a central axon that enters and ends on the Spinal Cord.
- Information therefore travels from Receptors down Peripheral Processes, past the Sensory Soma in the DRG and down the Central Process to enter the Spinal Cord

# Types of Sensory Receptors and their Functions

### Sensory Receptor Function

- Receptor potential is the Vm change that occurs at the Receptor Terminal of the Primary Afferent when stimulated by a Mechanical Stimulus
- As Stimulus Strength increases, more Mechanically Gated Channel in the Receptor Terminal open, causing more significant depolarisation which increases the Receptor Potential Generated here and establishes a receptor current
- If the Stimulus/Receptor Potential is strong enough, this will cross the Afferent AP Threshold, allowing for the generation of an AP which propagates down the Afferent Axon
- Frequency of Afferent Signalling is proportional to Receptor Potential, which is proportional to stimulus strength.
- The Relationship between Stimulus Intensity and AP Frequency is not linear (Frequency = log(Stimulus Intensity))
- This generates action potentials which are propagated down axon.

### Types of Sensory Receptor

1. **Slowly adapting:**
- Reports sustained pressure/stimulus.
- It responds strongly to the initial stimulus and produces sustained firing (often slightly lower than initial signalling frequency) until the stimulus is removed
- Magnitude of pressure is proportional to firing rate
1. **Rapidly adapting:**
- Fires proportionately to the first derivative of the pressure change
- Reports change elicited by Stimulus (onset of contact stimulus).
- These report changes in stimulus intensity (onset of stimulus) but do not fire when Stimulation Magnitude is kept constant/when stimulus is being maintained (Does not report sustained pressure)
- Magnitude of onset of stimulus is proportional to the firing rate.
- Important for vibration sense, rubbing hand over a surface result in rapidly changing stimulus, allowing us to understand the texture
- Adaptation can be viewed in 2 ways:
1. Economy: The Nervous System tends to only need to know about changes in stimulation vs levels of sustained stimulation therefore, it allows the Nervous System to used specialised RA Receptors to detect this change and different SA receptors to detect basal/prolonged stimulation levels.
2. RA Receptors firing only at the onset of stimulation allows them to have special sensitivity to high frequency vibration used in tactile discrimination (E.g Palpating Surfaces) which is constantly being applied and removed, generating an AP each time which can be detected by the CNS

# Classification of PNS Afferents

- Myelinated = Aα, Aβ and Aδ
- Unmyelinated = C (also small diameter axons)
- Aα = Ia and Ib
- From Small to Large Diameter and Low to High Conduction Velocity = C → Aδ → Aβ → Aα
- C Fibres = Small Unmyelinated Afferents conveying Slow Pain, Itch and Temperature
- Aδ = Small Myelinated Afferents conveying Fast Pain and Temperature
- Aβ = Intermediate Myelinated Afferents which convey touch information from Skin Mechanoreceptors
- Aα = Large Myelinated Afferents conveying Proprioception

# Skin Receptors

- 'Germans are Superficial, Italians are deep'

### Superficial Receptors ('German')

1. Merkel's Disk
2. Meissner's Corpuscles
- These detect low intensity chemical activity on the surface

### Deep Receptors ('Italian')

1. Pacinian Corpuscle
2. Ruffini’s Ending/Corpuscle

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 18.36.34.png](%5B044%5D%20Sensory%20Transduction%20and%20Receptors%208e265a38bdc448f9990a5f22e96b0bed/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_18.36.34.png)

# Cutaneous Receptor Types

### 1. Nociceptors **(Aδ, C)**

- Fast (Aδ fibres) and slow (C fibres) pain, based on Conduction Speed down each neuron type.
- This means that intensely noxious stimuli produce 2 phases of pain:
1. Initial, Mild. Sharp Pain (Short Duration), commonly accompanied with limb withdrawal via Flexion Withdrawal Crossed Extension Reflex via Aδ Afferents
2. Delayed and Prolonged Slow Pain via C Fibres (Strong Pain)

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 18.37.47.png](%5B044%5D%20Sensory%20Transduction%20and%20Receptors%208e265a38bdc448f9990a5f22e96b0bed/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_18.37.47.png)

**Axon Reflex**

- axon bringing in sensory information branches within periphery to produce branches with 3 main targets:
1. Branch to dorsal root ganglion carrying noxious signal (Tissue Damaging, High Level Stimulus) where it enters the Spinothalamic Tract to ascend to S1 to produce the Sensation of Pain.
2. Branch releases substance P, which acts on mast cells to secrete histamine, which sensitises nociceptive receptor/afferent ending, promotes inflammation and swelling, promote bradykinin release, increase [K⁺] and release Prostaglandins.
- These all directly increase the sensitivity of the Nociceptive Afferent Receptor Ending to produce a +ve feedback loop, which means after tissue injury, receptor is more sensitive and hence, more likely to be stimulated to lead to Histamine Release from Mast Cells
- This ensures that the damaged area is protected from further injury, allowing for it to heal
1. Branches also project directly to blood vessels and release Substance P here to produce vasodilation and ↑ blood flow.
- Silent Nociceptors = High threshold Mechoreceptors (Often found in Viscera) that do not usually fire Afferent AP in response to noxious Stimuli in non-inflammed states
- However, when the Nociceptive Axon Reflex establishes a Positive feedback sensitisation loop of Histamine Release (in response to initial Stimulus), this sensitises these Silent Nociceptors so that they can now depolarise above threshold and generate Afferent APs

### 2. Temperature (**Aδ, C}**

- This is conduced by Aδ and C Afferents
- Summation of the inputs from the cold and warm receptors results in a unique mapping of firing rates onto each temperature
- Cold receptors: From, 15°C activity of these receptors increases and peaks at 25°C, then at temperatures above this, activity decreases and goes away by 40°C.
- Warm receptors: Activity of these receptors begins at High 20s°C and peaks at 42°C before decreasing afterwards.
- The Overlap of the Temperatures over which Cold and Warm Temperature Receptors fire (Around Physiological/Body Temperatures) allows for sensitive/accurate detection of temperatures
- Temperatures found either side of the range in which both Cold and Warm Receptors are Active can be distinguished from one another as whilst Cold/Warm Receptors may be firing at identical rates at 2 different temperatures, Warm/Cold Receptor activity is different at each of these temperatures, allowing these different temperatures to be distinguished
- Paradoxical cold: cold receptors activity increases again beyond high 40°C whilst at 50°C, warm receptors stop firing.
- This means that at very high temperatures, individual is not entirely sure if temperature is hot or cold due to this stimulation of Cold Receptors despite the heat.
- These are used more than just as danger signals.
- The specific heat of an object is an important tactile identifier of an object and its composition/properties (e.g. wetness and conductance in metal vs plastic)

### 3. Mechanoreceptor (Aβ and Aδ)

Mechanoception is conducted by Aβ and Aδ Fibres via Superficial and Deep Receptors

# Superficial Mechanoreceptors and their Structure

### Distribution

- Meissner’s Corpuscles: situated on edge of dermal ridges/papillae.
- Capable of detecting vibrations (i.e. when palpating objects). Rapidly detecting type.
- Merkel’s Discs: situated in valleys. Slow adapting.

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 18.56.01.png](%5B044%5D%20Sensory%20Transduction%20and%20Receptors%208e265a38bdc448f9990a5f22e96b0bed/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_18.56.01.png)

### Structure

**Merkel's Disks**

- Linked mechanically by adherent junctions to surrounding keratinocytes within the Superificial Epidermis.
- Merkel's Disks activate afferent fibres via a Synapse between the Receptor and the Afferent Nerve Ending, found in contact with the Deep Surface of the Receptor.
- They are Slow adapting receptors, allowing them to detect levels of prolonged stimulus and maintain firing during the duration of the stimulus.

**Meissner's Corpuscles**

- These are bare nerve endings coiled around eachother in fluid-filled capsule.
- Pressure changes are transmitted through the Corpuscle and activate the Afferent fibres directly
- Rapidly adapting Receptor (Detects Pressure Changes vs Prolonged Levels of Pressure) due to the encapsulation of the Meissner's Corpuscles.
- Initial pressure is compensated by the reforming of Meissner corpuscles, hence resulting in the return of pressure to the normal state. Hence, constant change is required to activate the nerves here.

# Deep Mechanoreceptors

### Pacinian Corpuscle

- This is an encapsulated receptor (Capsule surrounding a linear Afferent Nerve Ending)
- They are rapidly adapting receptors
- Removing the capsule of the Pacinian Corpuscle changes the receptor to becoming slow adapting (reports sustained pressure instead), meaning the Capsule is responsible for the Fast Adapting Properties of the Receptor.
- Therefore, Encapsulated Receptors contain Afferents with Slowly Adapting Properties but become Fast Adapting due to their encapsulation
- This is because the Capsule is able to rapidly transmit the pressure waves to the afferent nerve ending and very shortly after this, absorbs the Pressure Waves to stop further stimulation of the Afferent Neuron, only releasing this stored pressure when the stimulus pressure is released, causing the Afferent to fire (allowing it to detect change in pressure vs sustained pressure)

### Ruffini Endings

- These are slowly adapting

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 18.58.52.png](%5B044%5D%20Sensory%20Transduction%20and%20Receptors%208e265a38bdc448f9990a5f22e96b0bed/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_18.58.52.png)

# Receptive Fields and Function

### Merkel Disks and Ruffini Endings

- Receptive Fields (RF) = The area of skin that when activated/stimulated, activates a single receptor (AKA region of skin that is associated with a single Receptor).
- Both are slowly adapting but have very different functions.
- Merkel discs: smallest RF. This allows them to detect fine discriminative touch as moving small distances along the skin activates a different Merkel Disk, allowing the regions of skin to be distinguished from one another.
- Ruffini endings: large RF. This means that they are not sensitive (don't detect fine touch) and do not detect high frequency vibrations (as they are slow vs fast adapting) but allows them to detect directional stretch.

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.00.25.png](%5B044%5D%20Sensory%20Transduction%20and%20Receptors%208e265a38bdc448f9990a5f22e96b0bed/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.00.25.png)

### Meissner and Pacinian Corpuscles

- Both use capsules to enhance their frequency response (make the receptors Fast Adapting), allowing them to detect high frequency vibration, but to completely different ends.
- Both rapidly adapting
- Meissner's Corpuscles can detect a lower range of Frequencies than Pacinian Corpuscles
- High Frequency Vibration Sensitivity is required as friction generated when the hands move across surfaces produces vibrations on the skin surface, which can be used to detect the texture and surface morphology of an object

**Meissner Corpuscles**

- Small RF. Detect local protuberances/vibrations and hence, detect surface morphology aspects of objects/point separations (E.g Ridges, Grooves and Projections of Objects).

**Pacinian Corpuscles**:

- Very large RFs. Very high sensitivity (Detect High Frequency Vibrations but over a larger region, allowing for accurate Texture Detection).

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 19.03.52.png](%5B044%5D%20Sensory%20Transduction%20and%20Receptors%208e265a38bdc448f9990a5f22e96b0bed/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_19.03.52.png)

### Microneurography Using Braille

- Test studied patients reading Braille on a rotating cylinder.
- Activity recorded on afferent fibres at wrist.
- Merkel discs: Stimulated RFs correlate very well/produce a similar pattern to Braille pattern, allowing the pattern to be read accurately/each dot to be discriminated (due to small RF of Merkel).
- Meissner corpuscles: like Merkel’s (Small RF means that RFs activated correlate very well/produce a similar pattern to the Braille pattern) Smeared/blurred horizontally as these receptors are encapsulated.
- Ruffini endings: RFs stimulated when reading the brain do not resemble the Braille Script (Braille Script and Activated RFs are not well correlated) but Receptors are fired with respect to when the finger read/felt each bump on the Braille Script, producing precise time coding.
- Pacinian corpuscles: Broad spread of RFs, producing erratic responses that are not correlated with the Braille Pattern seen (cannot be used to discriminate points on Braille Script).
- All receptors were used to collectively build an image of Braille pattern but Merkel and Meissner's Receptors are mainly used to read Braille with Ruffini Endings encoding when each dot is read/the order of Braille Figures

# Proprioceptors

- Measure muscle length and tension to inform brain about stance of body and progress of voluntary movements (deemed to be detected unconsciously traditionally but there are some projections to S1 which may produce limited conscious sense of Joint Position that is dependent on Muscle Spindle vs Skin Stretch and Joint Receptors).
- A𝛼=1a and Aβ = Type II Fibres
