# [034 & 035] Glia, Myelination, Degeneration and Regeneration 1 & 2

# Glia

- Half of brain volume is occupied by glial cells.
- Large majority of brain cells are glial cells.
- Nervous system is built from 2 classes of cells:
1. Neurones: can conduct action potentials (electrically excitable).
2. Glial cells: cannot conduct action potentials (not electrically excitable).
- There is a positive correlation between the number and complexity (more dendrites etc.) of Glial Cells (Mainly Astrocytes) in the Brain and the Computational Power of the Brain
- Glial-Like Cells are Multipotent Progenitors (Neural Stem Cells) in development
- They give rise to Neurons, Fibroblasts and Mature Glia in development and neurons in adults
- The Oligodendrocyte has many processes with each process ending in a Myelin Sheath that wraps itself around Large Axons

---

# Classical Functions of the Glia

### Mid 19th Century

- Connective tissue of brain.

### Mid 20th Century

- Homeostasis of extracellular space: ion concentrations/neurotransmitters.
- Metabolic needs of neurones (primarily lactate).
- Myelination of axons to increase conduction velocity.

### Now

- New functions have been discovered  and more functions are still being discovered
- This is changing views on Brain Development, Function and Disease
1. Formation of synapses.
2. Elimination of inappropriate synapses
3. Maintenance of synapses.
4. Control of synaptic function.
5. Control neuronal survival
6. Control brain blood flow.
7. Regulate repair after injury.
8. Control Pain

# Glia in the CNS

## Astrocyte

- Most common glial cell in brain.
- Processes end on blood vessels so that Astrocyte End Feet envelop/surround them completely and envelope/surround synapses.
- They positively affect information processing in the Brain, notably memory formation

### Synaptic Modulation/Control of Synaptic Function

- Most synapses in brain are enveloped by astrocyte processes.
- Neurotransmitter from the Presynaptic Membrane diffuses out of synaptic cleft.
- Astrocytes express neurotransmitter receptors, which become activated during Synaptic Transmission to ↑
Ca²⁺ influx to increase Intracellular [Ca²⁺]
- This activates secondary messengers (not AP generation) and causes the release of gliotransmitters.
- They act on Glioreceptors on pre or postsynaptic membranes to modulate synaptic transmission (↑/↓ sensitivity of synapses/synaptic transmission often by affecting receptor expression on the Pre and Postsynaptic Membranes).

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 08.25.29.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_08.25.29.png)

- Bipartite Synapse (Classical) = Presynaptic and Postsynaptic Membrane, involving the action of Neurotransmitters
- Tripartite synapse (New): Synaptic Transmission involves neurotransmitter and gliotransmitter release involving the Presynaptic, Postsynaptic and Astrocyte cells.

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 08.24.53.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_08.24.53.png)

- The role of Astrocytes in the Tripartite synapse shows that like Neurons, Glial Cells are signalling cells that are involved in information processing in the Brain (receive signals and responds by sending signals)
- Main Gliotransmitters = Glutamate, d-serine, ATP/Adenosine, TNFα, BDNP

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 08.28.02.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_08.28.02.png)

### Astrocytes and Canabinoids

- Cannabinoid Type-1 Receptor (CB1R) is one of the most abundant GPCRs in the Brain
- They are found on Neurons and Glia
- One of the major side effects of marijuana intoxication is memory impairment
- In the Hippocampus between CA3 and CA1, there are Glutamatergic Synapses involved in Memory formation and recall, which are excitatory via Postsynaptic AMPA-R Stimulation
- When Cannabinoids are present, They stimulate CB1R on Astrocytes, triggering Ca²⁺ Influx which leads to Glutamate release from the Astrocyte
- Glutamate activates NMDA-R which downregulates AMPA-R Expression (AMPA-R is internalised), reducing the magnitude of the depolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane in the CA3:CA1 Synapse in the Hippocampus due to Glutamate release
- This means the synapse is ineffective, leading to memory impairment due to poor synaptic transmission in synapses involved in Memory Formation

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 08.35.17.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_08.35.17.png)

- This means therefore that Neuron:Neuron and Neuron:Glia Neural Circuits are involved in communication and computation within the brain, notably in Memory and Consciousness
- Astrocytes communicate with one another via Gap Junctions involving Ca²⁺ waves and Gliotransmitters

### Canabinoid Receptors

- CB1R are primarily localized to presynaptic nerve
terminals in the central and peripheral nervous system.
- Stimulation of the CB1R causes the dissociation of the βγ subunits of pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins from the α subunit.
- The α subunit inhibits adenylyl cyclase resulting in a fall in intracellular [cAMP]
- The βγ subunits open G protein-gated inward rectifier K+ (GIRK) channels,
causing a more negative resting membrane potential.
- This combination of cannabinoid actions brings about an acute inhibition of synaptic neurotransmitter release, Suppressing neuronal activity in both CNS excitatory and inhibitory pathways

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 08.46.55.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_08.46.55.png)

### Homeostasis of the Extracellular Space

### K⁺ Buffering

- When an AP Propagates down an Axon, there is K⁺ Efflux which causes an accumulation of extracellular K⁺
- This increased Extracellular [K⁺] can depolarise nearby membranes via K⁺ Influx and hence, has to be rapidly reduce in order to prevent nearby neurons from generating APs and firing
- Astrocytes and Oligodendrocytes express Kir4.1 K⁺ Buffering Channels through which Excess K⁺ (generated during the AP) flows and this high [K⁺] dissipates across Microglia (connected via Gap Junctions) in order to keep Extracellular [K⁺] to normal levels

### Ending of Synaptic Transmission

- In order to end Synaptic Transmission, The Neurotransmitter must be removed from the Synaptic Cleft to prevent further activation of Postsynaptic Receptors
- Astrocytes express Neurotransmitter Transporters (Different to Neurotransmitter Receptors that are also expressed) through which Excess Neurotransmitter influxes into the Astrocyte, where they can be broken down or recycled
- This decreases [Neurotransmitter] in the Synapse, which stops Synaptic Transmission

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 08.57.43.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_08.57.43.png)

### Regulation of Cerebral Blood Flow

- Astrocytes signal to blood vessels as well as to Synapses and Each Other
- Brain Function is limited by the energy/ATP available so blood flow is increased to areas where nerve cells are active
- These changes in Blood Flow is controlled by Astrocytes and Neurons by shifting blood flow to active areas of the Brain
1. Neurotransmitters (E.g Glutamate) Signal to Astrocytes at Synapses
2. This causes Ca²⁺ Influx into the Astrocyte to increase Intracellular [Ca²⁺] and activate Intracellular Signalling Mechanisms
3. This Ca²⁺ spreads to the Astrocyte End Feet, where it causes the release of Glial-Derived Vasoactive Molecules (Commonly Arachidonic Acid Metabolites like Prostaglandins)
4. This causes Local Vasodilation, which increases Blood flow through the Vessel and hence, increased Oxygen and Glucose Delivery to the Active Nerve

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 09.07.11.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_09.07.11.png)

# Microglia

- Related to other immune cells of body (not derived from Neural Tube or NCCs). They are immune cells of CNS.
- They migrate into CNS during development and take up permanent residence.
- Cell bodies are stationary, but processes are constantly moving, monitoring brain tissue (This is called the surveillance/resting mode).
- When encountering specific Molecules, Microglia switch
- They are Plastic cells because they can change their phenotype - If they detect a virus/Antigen (Any  Disturbance in Cerebral Homeostasis) in surveillance resting state, they become activated. They can then become phagocytic.
- Morphologically, the Activated Microglia have shorter, thicker Processes and secrete Inflammatory Mediators
- Morphologically, Phagocytic Microglia have little to no processes and phagocytose dead cells and Pathogens
- Astroglia are involved in:
1. Acting as a HIV reservoir
2. Neurone/synapse elimination during development (and potentially, age related degeneration).
3. Chronic Pain
4. Migration to Sites of Injury/Infection

---

# Chronic Neuropathic Pain

- Acute Pain = Transient and related to overt tissue damage
- Chronic Pain = Persistent and typically not due to Overt Damage
- Neuropathic: pathology of neurons.
- This pain function is persistent and believed to be due to subtle nerve damage (e.g. amputation, back, hip or leg problems, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, shingles, cancer).
1. Subtle Damage to Sensory Neurons (Primary Nociceptors - Detect High intensity Stimuli) leads to a change in Central (Spinal Cord) processing of sensory input Between Primary and Second Order Nociceptive Neurons 
2. This processing involves GABAergic Interneurons and Glial Cells, with Damage to Primary Afferents leading to the amplification of non-noxious and noxious stimulation by improving the effectivess of Synapses involved in Central Processing (Neurons involved in the Synapse are Hyperexcitable)
3. This leads to increased sensitisation and activation of 2nd Order Pain Projection Neurons, meaning that normally non-noxious stimuli becomes painful, amplifying responses to Noxious Stimuli
- This subtle damage to Primary Nociceptive Afferents could be modelled artificially via Nerve Ligation, just distal to/around the DRG

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 09.23.11.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_09.23.11.png)

### Amplificiation of Central Nociceptive Processing by Microglia

- GABAergic Interneurons synapse on and hyperpolarise 2nd Order Pain (via Cl⁻ Influx) Neurons to inhibit these
- Distress signals (CCL2, ATP etc.) from damaged/ligated nociceptive axons activate local resting Microglia and Astrocytes
- ATP (As a Distress Signal from Damaged Nociceptive Afferents and Activated Astrocytes) binds to P2X4R on Activated Microglia to stimulate BDNF Release
- BDNF binds to BDNF receptors on the cell membrane of the Second Order Nociceptive Neurone, downregulating KCC2 channel activity, which normally mediates Cl⁻ Influx
- This reduces GABA Mediated Hyperpolarisation via Cl⁻ Influx via KCC2, Making 2nd Order Pain Neurons Hyperexcitable/More Sensitive to Stimuli, leading to Hyperactivity of Nociceptive Fibres which causes Chronic Neuropathic Pain
- P2X adenosine receptor blockers can block pain by preventing ATP from binding to Activated Microglia, reducing BDNF Release and hence, Chronic Pain Development.

# Astrocytes and Microglia

### Neurone/Synapse Elimination During Development

- As Synapses form in Mixed Neuron-Glial Cultures but not in pure neuron cultures, Glial-Derived Signals (From Astrocytes but not Oligodendrocytes) promote Synapse formation
- Synaptic pruning occurs in Adolescence eliminates weaker synapses, while stronger are maintained (Competitive Vs Random Elimination).
- Experience/Activity determines pruning: synapses that have been activated most frequently are stronger and hence, maintained.

![Screenshot 2021-11-29 at 00.42.59.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-29_at_00.42.59.png)

- Astrocytes promote synapse formation during development via TGFβ, Cholesterol, BDNF, Thrombospondin, Glypicans by forming the morphology of the Synapse and then inducing receptor expression to make it functional.
- Phagocytic Microglia can eliminate synapses via similar mechanisms as Macrophages (via Complement Proteins).

![Screenshot 2021-11-29 at 00.43.29.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-29_at_00.43.29.png)

- There is a reduction in synaptic number in Age-Related Degeneration, Dementias, Alzheimer's and Schizophrenia
- Therefore as Glial Cells control Synapse formation and elimination, failure of these mechanisms constitutes a new module of brain pathology
- In Schizophrenia, there is reduced synaptic support via Astrocytes and there is Increased Aggression/Activity of Phagocytic Microglia, increasing Synapse Elimination

---

# Oligodendrocytes

### Myelination of Axon

- Myelination makes rapid conduction of action potentials possible.
- 1 oligodendrocyte can make 40-50 myelin segments around 40-50 axons.
- Myelin is formed by apposition/folding of plasma membranes to form a double membrane, which wraps itself in concentric layers around axon.
- CNS myelin contains proteolipid protein (9PLP/DM-20) and myelin basics protein (MBP).

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 09.47.47.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_09.47.47.png)

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 09.49.06.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_09.49.06.png)

### Multiple Sclerosis

- Sclerotic Plaques are formed in areas of Demyelination where there are no Oligodendrocytes present
1. Healthy Myelinating Oligodendrocytes become damaged via an Autoimmune Attack, leading to Demyelination
2. This Demyelination disturbs brain Homeostasis, activating Microglia which release Inflammatory Mediators, leading to Death of Oligodendrocytes
3. The Death of Oligodendrocytes means that there is a lack of Trophic and Metabolic Support of Axons which are usually surrounded and supported by the Oligodendrocyte Processes, causing Axonal Death
4. Axonal and Oligodendrocyte Death release DAMPs (Danger Associated Molecular Patterns), which further stimulate Microglia Activation and Inflammatory Mediator Release
5. This leads to further Oligodendrocyte and Neuronal Death in a Positive Feedback loop to cause Multiple Sclerosis to progress
- Immunosuppression in attempts to reduce the Autoimmune Attack of Oligodendrocytes and Inflammatory Microglia Activation (E.g IFN-β, Glatiramer Acetate, Mitoxantrone and Various mAbs), which reduces Oligodendrocyte Demyelination and Death, preventing the development of Multiple Sclerosis
- NG2 cells: found throughout CNS and make up 5-10% of all glia.
- Unlike other Glia, Neurons form synapses on NG2 Cells and can act as Postsynaptic Cells
- Key function is to migrate into Demyelinated Plaques (such as those found in MS) and differentiate to form oligodendrocytes, which can remyelinate axons, presenting an Endogenous Myelin Repair Mechanism
- Therefore, by administering drugs that stimulate NG2 Cells into Px with MS, there is potential of the formation of new myelinating Oligodendrocytes, remyelinating and hence, preventing Axonal Death, preventing MS Development

# Peripheral Nervous System

- Schwann cells are glial cells of peripheral nerves.
- Myelinating Schwann cells are the PNS equivalent of oligodendrocytes.
- Non-myelinating Schwann cells are the PNS equivalent of astrocytes

![Screenshot 2021-11-29 at 00.51.01.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-29_at_00.51.01.png)

### Schwann Cell Myelin

- Dedicate themselves to 1 myelin sheath only (unlike oligodendrocytes which are associated with multiple axons).

---

# Axonal Injuries

- Peripheral fibre tracts (nerves) regenerate in principle following axonal death distal to the injury (but there is debate about whether it can regenerate sufficiently to restore function) - This is still a significant clinical problem.
- Central fibre tracts do not regenerate.
- Axon regeneration depends on:
1. Intrinsic capacity of neuron to build a new axon (PNS Neurons can potentially switch to a growth phenotype whereas CNS Neurons cannot very well)
2. Growth-permissiveness of axonal environment.
- Both in CNS and PNS, the environment of injured and regenerating axons is glial cells.
- PNS: Schwann cells (myelinating and non-myelinating (Remak) cells).
- CNS: oligodendrocytes and astrocytes.
- By testing the role of the Neuronal Environment on the Regenerative Capacity of Neurons, PNS and CNS Neurons were injured and the Regenerated PNS Segment of the Neuron was transplanted to the Site of CNS Injury
- They found the CNS Axon now regenerated through the transplanted PNS Segment
- Therefore, in principle, both CNS and PNS Neurons can regenerate but it is the differences in the PNS and CNS environment which is the main reason as to why PNS Neurons can regenerate whilst CNS Neurons cannot due to differences in the Injury Response to PNS and CNS Glia

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 10.37.01.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_10.37.01.png)

- If a nerve is cut and its proximal stump is deflected into a normal, uncut parallel nerve, the expectation is that good regeneration of the Injured Nerve down the Parallel axon will occur due to Schwann Cell Support
- However, in reality, the Growth Cone of the Injured Neuron collapses, leading to poor regeneration

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 10.41.55.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_10.41.55.png)

- This shows that the Schwann Cells in the PNS do not support regeneration when they are already associated with an axon
- This is because axons grow through Schwann Cells that are denervated but not innervated Schwann Cells as Injury and Axon Degeneration (Schwann Cell Denervation) triggers the reprogramming of Myelin and Remak Cells to specialise to support repair (Become Repair Schwann Cells)

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 10.46.54.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_10.46.54.png)

### Schwann Cell Injury Response

- Schwann Cells Breakdown myelin which contains inhibitors of axon growth = MAG, Omg, Nogo.
- Axonal Death triggers cellular reprogramming of Schwann Cells, becoming Elongated and forming Processes that aggregate together end-to-end.
- This forms regeneration tracks (Bands of Bungner) that guide axons back to targets via the secretion of Trophic Molecules whilst expressing Surface Molecules that prevent Axonal Death and Promote Regenertion
- Once Axons have successfully regenerated, Repair Cells transform back into Remak and Myelin Schwann Cells

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 10.48.16.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_10.48.16.png)

### CNS Glia Prevent Repair After Injury

- Oligodendrocytes fail to break down myelin fragments (therefore growth inhibitory molecules MAG, Omg, Nogo from Myelin persist).
- Astrocytes start expressing growth inhibitory molecules (proteoglycans, tenascin, Semaphorins, ephrin-B2, Slit),
- Astrocytes enlarge and proliferate to form glial scar alongside Microglia and NG2 Cells around the site of Injury.
- Glial scar isolates/surrounds the injury to prevent further damage of area.
- The Glial Scar Inhibits Axonal Regeneration by forming a physical barrier to prevent axons growing through it but also by expressing Molecular Inhibitors of Axonal Growth:
1. Chondroitin Sulphate Proteoglycans (CSPGs)
2. Myelin Molecules (MAG, Omg)
3. EphrinB3 and Nogo
- However, if the Glial Scar is prevented from forming, the CNS does not regenerate but rather, there is increased inflammation of the Injury Site, leading to increased Neuronal Death, Axon Die-Back and Demyelination

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 10.52.10.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_10.52.10.png)

# Regenerative Capacity of CNS and PNS Neurons

- CNS Neurons can regenerate when the environment is particularly favourable (Surrounded by Denervated Schwann Cells that can become Repair Schwann Cells)
- But in comparison to PNS Neurons, their regenerative Capacity is very low
- During Axonal Regeneration, The Proximal PNS Neuronal Stump readily form Growth Cones and Switches to a Growth Phenotype via Changing Gene Expression, readily promoting growth
- In Comparison, Most CNS Neurons have a reduced ability to form Growth Cones and switch gene expression to develop a Growth Phenotype, preventing sufficient regeneration
- By increasing Microtubule Stabilisation within the CNS, this can potentially increase the ability of the CNS to form and maintain Growth Cones, increasing their regenerative capacity

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 11.02.56.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_11.02.56.png)

# Neurogenesis

- During development, large numbers of CNS neurones are generated from radial glial cells (early glia related to astrocytes).
- In adult, neurones continue to be generated in adult brain in 2 regions:
1. Subventricular zone of lateral ventricles.
2. Hippocampus
- New neurones are generated from adult neural stem cells that are very similar in appearance to astrocytes via the generation of Neuronal Progenitors, Neuroblasts and then Mature Neurons.

![Screenshot 2021-11-30 at 11.07.49.png](%5B034%20&%20035%5D%20Glia,%20Myelination,%20Degeneration%20and%20Re%2044090ad9c4ff44d3a3514bb66a9cd1ab/Screenshot_2021-11-30_at_11.07.49.png)

- The rate of neurogenesis is inversely correlated with depression (As Neurogenesis Decreases, Risk of Depression increases)
- Reduced depression and Increased neurogenesis = exercise, enriched environment, learning.
- Increased depression and Reduced neurogenesis = stress, alcohol, ageing.
- ↑ neurogenesis: (seen with a delay of 2-3 weeks) and can be stimulated by:
1. Antidepressants (e.g. Prozac/Fluoxetine) - take weeks to work.
2. Electroconvulsive treatments
