# [072] Imaging the Brain and Spinal Cord

# Brain Imaging

### X-Ray

- Radiography - Bones
- Myelography - Contrast around Spine (CSF Space)
- Cisternography - Contrast in Cistern of the Skull (CSF Space)
- Angiography - Visualise inside, or lumen of blood vessels
- CT - Allows visualisation of soft tissue. Scan is completed in 1 minute

### MRI

- T1/T2 Weighted Image
- Angiography (MRA) - Generate images of arteries (less commonly veins) to check for stenosis, occlusions and aneurysms.
- Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) - Use of specific MRI sequences as well as software that generates images from resulting data, that uses diffusion of water molecules to generate contrast in MR images.
- Perfusion weighted - Looks at perfusion of tissues by blood.
- Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)- Measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow.
- Spectroscopy

### Ultrasound

- Doppler

# CT

- Used to assess skull (bone) for trauma and fractures.
- Visualises brain.
- Air: black (no absorption).
- Bone: white (lots of absorption).
- Grey matter: lighter (absorbs more than white matter).
- White matter: darker (absorbs less than grey matter).
- CSF: darker (absorbs less).
- Skull base has horizontal streaks across/artefacts.
- Computer has problem computing image, because temporal bone is so
dense.

### CT Bone Windows on Skull Base

- Bone is quite dense.
- To visualise any structures, use bone windowing
- Windowing (grey-level mapping, contrast stretching, contrast enhancement): CT image grey scale component of an image is manipulated via CT numbers.
- This changes appearance of picture to highlight particular structures.

### CT Bone Windows in Trauma

- In patients with trauma, can lead to contusion (region of injured tissue or skin in which blood capillaries have been ruptured; a bruise).
- [Top left] Hypodensity oedema (blood).
- [Top right] Left hand side.
- Bone window to see/exclude fracture.
- [Bottom left] Epidural haematoma.

# Hypo and Hyperdense Structures

- When looking at CTs of the Brain, assess symmetry (Both sides are not completely symmetrical but are similar) and then look for signs of Mass Effect (Midline Shift)
- How does pathology reveal itself in brain?
1. Density ↑/↓, causing pathology to darken or lighten.
2. Volume ↑/↓ in size.
- [Left] ↓ density (darker). No ↑ in volume. Scar tissue (infarct).
- [Right] ↓ density (darker) with ↑ volume, pushing brain to right. Intrinsic tumour.

### Hyperdense (Bright) Structures

- Brain is not exactly symmetrical, and skews to left (dominant side) slightly.
- Can either be calcification or blood.
- Calcification appears extremely Hyperdense and uniform in density whereas blood appears slightly less Hyperdense and has varying density

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 16.50.37.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_16.50.37.png)

- [Left] symmetrical calcification in putamen and geniculate bodies.
- Amorphous Fahr’s syndrome (possibly genetic) causing cognitive impairment.
- Fahr’s syndrome: rare, genetically dominant, inherited neurological disorder.
- Characterised by abnormal deposits of Ca²⁺ in areas of brain that control movement.
- Through CT, calcification is seen primarily in basal ganglia and other areas of cerebral cortex.
- [Middle] Meningioma (tumour) with central calcification.
- No structures normally cross the anterior cranial fossa.
- Calcification of pineal gland (behind 3rd V).
- [Right] Shift in symmetry.
- Haemorrhage in parenchyma of brain, which leaks into ventricular system.
- If patient is in 50s-60s, this is where hypertensive haemorrhage occurs. Calcification (in right side) of choroid plexus.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 16.52.47.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_16.52.47.png)

# Haemorrhage and Haematoma

### Location of Haemorrhage

- [Left] Internal capsule, most often due to hypertension if patient is in 50s-60s. If a young patient, have a different approach.
- Think more of vascular abnormalities (like cavernomas, anterior venous
malformations).
- [Right] Subarachnoid haemorrhage in lateral fissures.
- Often results from hypertension. 80% caused by aneurysms, 15% arteriovenous malformations (AVM), 5% idiopathic.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 16.54.07.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_16.54.07.png)

### Extra-Axial/Intracranial Haematomas

- Extra-axial (intracranial) haematoma: bleeding that occurs within skull but outside of brain tissue.
- Epidural: from middle meningeal artery.
- Subdural: venous origins. Grows slowly for a long period of time.
- [Left] Epidural. More than 2 cm displacement from midline.
- If not sorted immediately, patient will die within a few hours.
- Open skull to remove pressure.
- [Middle] Could be epidural. Older patient with no severe clinical presentation.
- [Right] Subdural haematoma. Crosses midline by 1 cm (mass effect).
- Not immediately urgent (hours), but still urgent (within day).

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 16.55.20.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_16.55.20.png)

### Subdural Haematoma

- Can tell it is subdural because there has been time for blood to separate.
- [Left] Compression of brain.
- Patient could have had this for weeks months.
- Patient can present with a simple headache.
- [Middle] Midline displacement into left hemisphere.
- [Right] Midline displacement. Harder to spot than [middle].

- White matter is dark, grey matter is lighter.
- [Middle] Anterior commissure (top horizontal line).
- Posterior commissure (horizontal line above white central structure).
- [Right] Shows skull base.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 16.57.37.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_16.57.37.png)

- Can be seen in some conditions (e.g. meningitis, encephalitis, haemorrhage, tumours).
- [Right] Pachymeningeal enhancement (dura-arachnoid enhancement).
- Seen in some conditions (e.g. infections, intracranial tumour, intracranial hypotension, RA).

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 16.58.20.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_16.58.20.png)

### T1 and T2 Weighting

- [Left] T2 weighting.
- [Right] Kind of a T1 (CSF is black, fat is whiter, good grey and white matter differentiation).
- Coronal view (CT was only axial until recently).
- MRI can be in any plane.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 16.58.57.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_16.58.57.png)

### Subarachnoid Cyst

- [Left] Cyst is white (T2).
- [Right] Cyst is dark (T1).
- This is a subarachnoid posterior fossa cyst. Displacing tumour

### Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)

- This is mainly used for T2 weighted image where it becomes difficult to identify pathologies (Bright structures) that are adjacent to a bright structure (E.g Ventricles)
- Suppresses signal from water/CSF which produces the bright signal (CSF stains dark).
- Multiple sclerosis: indicative through multiple lesions and a young patient.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.00.31.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.00.31.png)

- [Top right] Better contrast difference seen in coronal flair
- [Bottom left] Without contrast
- [Bottom right] With contrast.
- Images show a low-grade glioma.
- Usually patients in 30s-40s.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.01.07.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.01.07.png)

### Subacute Subdural Haematoma

- Subdural haemorrhage
- [Left] Subdural haemorrhage.
- Hyperintense in T1 because it is subacute.
- [Middle] Hyperintense in T2 (most of time).
- [Right] Coronal T1. 2 subdural haematomas.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.01.45.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.01.45.png)

### Basal Ganglia Haemorrhage

- T2 weighted
- Blood is not bright, but dark, because it is hyperacute (recently occurred) and then appears bright afterwards.
- Hyperacute haemorrhage couple of hours ago.
- Hyperintensity because of vasogenic oedema.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.02.21.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.02.21.png)

### Internal Structures of the Skull Base

- CN VIII leaves the Skull Base through an extremely thick part of the Skull, which is difficult to visualise on normal CT
- On CT, you cannot see Internal Structures within the Skull base very well, only indentations that are made by these structures
- On MRI, you cannot see the indentations in bone made by these structures but where Structures are Fluid-Filled (E.g Cochlea), the fluid within these structures and hence, the structures themselves can be visualised

![Screenshot 2022-01-17 at 08.15.04.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-17_at_08.15.04.png)

### Hippocampus

- 1.5 Field Strength (Standard Clinical)

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.03.05.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.03.05.png)

- 4.7 Field Strength

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.03.15.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.03.15.png)

# Microscopic MRI

- Can see various sub-structures and correlate to diagrams and histology.
- 9.4 field strength scanner.
- For human use is quite rare (only experimentally used).
- Scanned for 30 hour (no movement, no palpation).

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.04.55.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.04.55.png)

# Angiography

- Used to diagnose:
    1. Rupture: leads to haemorrhage.
    2. Occlusion: leads to ischaemia.
    3. Vascularisation: of a pathological process.
    4. Large tumour: surgeons want to take it out, but are concerned about blood loss
- Implications:
1. Injury to entrance site. This is reparable.
2. 0.5% of patients will develop a stroke.

### Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA)

- Taking images with and without contrast, and subtracting 1 from other so that the structures where the contrast is found can be easily visualised without the bone

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.08.09.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.08.09.png)

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.09.18.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.09.18.png)

### CT Angiography

- Inject contrast into vein, not artery (usually into arm).
- Additional advantage is visualisation of calcification around vessels.
- This cannot be seen in DSA.
- CT also gives aspects of vessel wall.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.10.11.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.10.11.png)

### MR Angiography

- Can image vessels without contrast using flow sensitive sequences.
- Better resolution
- Wider field of view.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.10.51.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.10.51.png)

# Diffusion Weighted (DW) MRI

### Water Diffusion (Brownian motion) in Stroke

- In cytotoxic oedema, cells balloon in site, causing restriction in diffusion of molecules between those cells through the Extracellular Space.
- Areas of restricted diffusion appear bright in DWI.

### White Matter tracts on Diffusion Tensor Imaging

- White matter can be thought of as axonal tracts.
- Diffusion therefore occurs in 1 direction down these tracts, and is more limited in other directions.
- Anisotropy: property of being directionally dependent.
- This is primarily done to visualise tracts before surgery to identify relationship between pathology and tracts to try and minimise damage to these tracts when correcting the Pathology
- This is also used to visualise Strokes by identifying areas of Cerebral Infarct

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.12.02.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.12.02.png)

### Arcuate Fasciculus

- [Image] Tracts consider important. Blue is arcuate fasciculus.
- Arcuate fasciculus: important for language, and usually in left hemisphere.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.12.39.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.12.39.png)

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.16.03.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.16.03.png)

### DWI in Posterior Fossa Stroke: Basilar Artery Occlusion

- [Left] Occlusion. Should continue upwards.
- This can lead to locked-in syndrome.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.17.44.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.17.44.png)

# MR Perfusion Weighted Imaging

- Give contrast and compare region of interest in both hemispheres.
- See how contrast is perfused to both hemispheres by taking many regular images over a specified time period.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.18.47.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.18.47.png)

### Acute Stroke - PWI/DWI Mismatch

- PWI - Information about perfusion and DWI - Information about location of Ischaemia
- Gives idea of what is likely/not likely to be able to be salvaged (where Brain is Hypoperfused but not yet Ischaemic and hence, salvagable).
- IV thrombolysis is what you start with until patients gets to interventional radiologist to remove thrombus (thrombectomy)

---

# fMRI

- Measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow.
- This relies on fact that cerebral blood flow and neuronal activation are coupled.
- When an area of brain is in use, blood flow to that region also ↑.
- Use an internal contrast (no need to inject).
- Certain areas of brain become active, leading to dilation of supplying vessels which ↑ O₂ supply to the active region.
- Would expect [de-oxy Hb] to ↑, but it actually ↓ due to increased supply of Oxygenated Blood to this region.
- Images can then be taken regularly over a period of time to see how metabolic activity and hence, neural activity in that region varies when a specific movement/action is carried out, allowing for Functional Localisation
- Experimentally induced signal change: use fMRI to monitor brain activity with simple activity (i.e. opening and closing fist).
- Relate cerebral changes in signal to movement of hand.
- Task related signal can then be projected onto a brain and these regions of
brain therefore relate to movement.

---

# fMRI Vs PET (H₂O)

- Produce similar images.
- PET:
1. Not available everywhere.
2. Contrast is quite expensive (fMRI doesn’t need contrast).

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.20.59.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.20.59.png)

### Validation

- fMRI of language function activates many areas of brain.
- From surgical point of view, many of these areas can be removed without a speech language deficit.
- Patient is kept awake, and asked to speak.
- Regions of brain electrically stimulated, and if these prevent speech, disturbance is noted.
- Compare this to fMRI [Left image], and there is a reasonable correlation
- This allows for localisation of ‘safe’ areas of the Brain/Tumour where surgery can be performed with minimal neurological defects

# Interventional Neuroradiology

### Flow Impairment

- Stenosis → Shunting
- Occlusion → Thrombolysis

### Rupture

- Aneurysm → Coiling
- Arteriovenous Malformation → Embolisation

### Carotid Stenting

- [Left] Patient with carotid stenosis.
- [Middle] Stent mesh.
- [Right] Flow restored.
- Don’t need to get to same diameter as above and below stenosis but need to dilate the vessel sufficiently to restore normal blood flow.

### Thrombolysis of Left MCA Occlusion

- Microcatheter Inserted through a larger Catheter and then the Thrombolytic Agent is released

### GDC (Guglielmi Detachable Coil) Occlusion of an Aneurysm

- Coil is expensive: £500-£1,500 each.
- Detached by a small electrical current passing through the guide wire.
- Coil provides a framework for thrombosis in aneurysm.
- Important to put coil in aneurysm without bursting through aneurysm itself.
- 2 catheters are used. 1 enters aneurysm, and other crosses neck.
- Inflate balloon, in such a way that when balloon is deflated, coil itself doesn’t come out.

![Screenshot 2022-01-15 at 17.24.59.png](%5B072%5D%20Imaging%20the%20Brain%20and%20Spinal%20Cord%20a6302e63441f4062b13dc715982c5ecd/Screenshot_2022-01-15_at_17.24.59.png)

### Palliative Tumour Embolisation (Skull Metastases)

- [First] Large highly vascularised tumour.
- [Second] Contrast shows ‘blush’ of tumour.
- [Third] Inject large number of small particles that get stuck in small arteries.
- Tumour de-vascularises.
- Few days later becomes necrotic, losing its mass effect.
