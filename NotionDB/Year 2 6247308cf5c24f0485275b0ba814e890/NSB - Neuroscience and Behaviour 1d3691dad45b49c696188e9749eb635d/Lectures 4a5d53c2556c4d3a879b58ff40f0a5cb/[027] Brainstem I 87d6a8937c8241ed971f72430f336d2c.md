# [027] Brainstem I

# General Somatosensory Systems

- These are responsible for allowing sensation by transmitting sensory information from the periphery (often via skin) to the sensory areas of the cerebral cortex
- Sensory axons in peripheral nerves are called primary afferents
- Spinal nerves are attached to the spinal cord by two routes
- There is a dorsal root for sensory/afferent information and ventral/efferent root for motor information
- Different types of primary afferent axons in peripheral nerves carry different types of sensation (Mechanoception, Nociception etc.)
- The intensity of the stimulus is coded for by the frequency of the action potentials
- Not all afferents give rise to sensation as some information goes to the cerebellum and are used in reflexes
- Afferent fibres go to the dorsal root
- If it is a sensory fibre of a cranial nerve, they are found in cranial nerve ganglia
- Cranial nerve ganglia and dorsal route ganglia are sensory ganglia

### Dorsal Root Ganglia

- The dorsal root ganglion is found on the dorsal root and contains cell bodies of primary afferents
- Each primary afferent has an axon which bifurcates into a central axon which goes to the CNS and a peripheral axon which goes out into the periphery and detects a stimulus
- There are different sizes of primary afferent neurons which determines how they are classified and what their function is

# Primary Afferent Neurones

Different types of primary afferent neurons carry different sorts of information

- Muscle Physiologists defined primary afferents in terms of size (I, II, III and IV, with IV being the smallest diameter)
- Skin Physiologists defined primary afferents as A,B and C, with C being the smallest diameter
- The larger diameter of the Primary Afferent, the Deeper in the Dorsal Horn that it ends

**C-Fibres**

- The smallest diameter primary afferent are c-fibres in peripheral nerves which have the smallest cell bodies and unmyelinated axons
- These convey nociceptive information and temperature
- As they are unmyelinated, they are the slowest of the primary afferent fibres. Any activity going up a c-fibre will be interpreted as pain
- C-Fibre axons enter the spinal cord and end in the Superficial Dorsal Horn of the Grey Matter (Notably Lamina II/Substantia Gelatinosa)

**Aβ Fibres**

- Aβ fibres are larger and myelinated and end deep in the Dorsal Horn (Deeper than c-fibres)
- They include a large number of mechanoceptive fibres
- They detect touch and vibration
- They are faster at conducting impulses than c-fibres
- If these are stimulated, it will be interpreted by the nervous system as mechanoceptive information e.g. touch

**1a Fibres**

- The fastest conducting primary afferents are the 1a afferents that innervate the muscle spindles (act as muscle stretch receptors)
- 1a afferents are large diameter, myelinated fibres with large cell bodies.
- The afferents from muscle spindles are mainly 1a afferents
- 1a afferents carry proprioceptive information about muscle stretch up towards the spinal cord, synapsing on motor neurones in the ventral horn of the spinal cord
- If these are stimulated, it will be interpreted by the nervous system as muscle stretch
- The thinner the axons, the more superficially in the grey matter of the spinal cord they end
- C-fibres all end in the superficial dorsal horn
- There are some other thinly myelinated fibres (Aδ fibres) that convey nociceptive information as well as c-fibres

# Sensory Tracts in the Spinal Cord

- These are bundles of sensory axons that carry information up from the spinal cord to the brain
- Information from sensory receptors has to be carried up to the cerebral cortex as we experience sensations with our cerebral cortex
- Cerebral cortex covers the cerebral hemisphere
- Somatosensory information has to arrive at the cerebral cortex from the spinal cord, so there have to be tracts going up the spinal cord conveying somatosensory information
- There are at least three neurons on every somatosensory tract conveying information from the spinal cord towards the cerebral cortex:
1. Primary sensory neurons/afferents (1) have cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia. The central processes of these axons go to the spinal cord and synapse on the same side of the CNS
2. Second order neurons/afferents (2) have their cell bodies on the same side of the CNS where the information comes in. Their axons ascend in the spinal cord and cross the midline and go up to the thalamus where they synapse
3. Thalamic/third order neurons/afferents (3) project up to somatosensory areas of cerebral cortex from the thalamus, where the sensation is felt
- There can be more than three neurons on these pathways but there are always at least three neurons

![%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.02.08.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.02.08.png)

# Spinothalamic Tract

- There are different sorts of somatosensory information which are conveyed by different tracts
- It is called spinothalamic tract as the spinothalamic axon originates in the spinal cord and ends in the thalamus
- The Spinothalamic Tract primarily conveys **nociceptive information**, temperature and non-discriminative touch towards the cerebral cortex
- Touch is carried by several different pathways
- The primary afferents are mainly unmyelinated c-fibres but there are also some Aδ fibres
- The most numerous fibres going into muscles are not motor axons but c-fibres
- C-fibres are the most numerous nociceptive axons and end as free nerve endings in the skin
- Their axons have cell bodies in the DRG
- The central processes of the c-fibres end in the superficial horn end on the same side that they came in
- The second order neuron (spinothalamic tract axons) projects across the midline/decussates just anterior to the central canal and ascends the spinal cord in the spinothalamic tract, towards the thalamus where it synapses
- The decussation means the spinothalamic tract conveys information from the contralateral side of the body
- Second Order Spinothalamic Tract Axons = Tract Cells
- The spinothalamic tract axons give a lot of collaterals into the brainstem, including into the reticular formation. The reticular formation has many functions but, in this context, relates to maintaining alertness in response to the painful stimulus
- The thalamic neuron projects from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex where the pain is felt

# Dorsal Column/Medial Lemniscus System

- This conveys **two-point discrimination** (identifying that 2 nearby points touching the skin are 2 separate points - Normally via Meissner's Corpuscles), conscious proprioception and vibration sense
- The axons travel up the dorsal columns in the spinal cord and they go up the medial lemniscus in the brainstem to get to the thalamus
- Two-point discrimination is the ability to feel how many points are touching the skin without looking
- This ability is greatest in the palms of the hands and fingers + face, where the points need to be very close together before one cannot tell whether it is two or one points touching the skin
- The back of the hand is much less sensitive, and this occurs when the points are much further apart
- Conscious proprioception is knowledge of the position of the body without directly seeing it. E.g. wrist behind the back
- Vibration sense is tested by banging a tuning fork (normally on the malleoli) and asking the patient whether they can feel it
- The primary afferent fibres are larger diameter and myelinated and are Aβ or 1a afferents
- The central process of this axon goes into the spinal cord
- It travels up the spinal cord ipsilaterally in the dorsal columns (white matter tracts on the dorsal side of the spinal cord)
- It synapses in the lower part of the medulla (upper closed medulla) in the dorsal column nuclei
- The second order neuron is in the dorsal column nucleus
- Its axon crosses the midline and goes up to the thalamus in a bundle called the medial lemniscus
- The thalamic neuron then conveys information from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex
- It does not carry nociception and does not send collaterals to the Brainstem Reticular Formation, unlike the Spinothalamic Tract
- Main difference between Spinothalamic Tract and Dorsal Column/Medial Lemniscus Tract is that Spinothalamic Tract has synapse in Spinal Cord whereas DC/ML Tract has synapse in Medulla. They also carry different forms of sensation

# Cross-Sections of Tracts in the Spinal Cord

### Spinothalamic Tract

- The red circles show lateral corticospinal tracts which are by far the largest
- Second order sensory neurons which synapse with C-fibres and Aδ fibres that enter the superficial dorsal horn have axons which cross the midline to join the contralateral spinothalamic tracts, where it ascends to the thalamus
- C-fibre Nociceptive Afferents likely end in Lamina II (Substantia Gelatinosa) whereas Aδ Nociceptive Afferents likely end in Lamina I
- The axons cross just ventral/anterior to the central canal
- They are found in the ventrolateral white matter of the spinal cord

![%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.24.19.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.24.19.png)

### Dorsal Column/Medial Lemniscus Pathway

- The primary afferents enter the spinal cord to reach the dorsal columns of white matter, which are found on the dorsal side of the spinal cord and are columns in the white matter
- The columns contain central processes from DRG neurons
- In the upper part of the spinal cord (above T6), there are two columns (fasciculus cuneatus and gracilis) on each side
- The medial one is fasciculus gracilis whilst the lateral one is called fasciculus cuneatus - Can remember it is medial as gracilis is on the medial side of the thigh
- In the lower part of the spinal cord (below T6) there is one column (fasciculus gracilis) on each side
- Fasciculus gracilis is present in the lower part of the spinal cord, whilst fasciculus cuneatus is only present above T6
- Fasciculus gracilis conveys information from the lower limb (hence gracilis) whilst fasciculus cuneatus conveys information from the upper half of the body
- Afferents involved in the DC/ML Tract from body segments above T6 (Upper half of the body) ascend in the Fasciculus Cuneatus and Afferents involved in the DC/ML Tract from body segments below T6 (Lower Half of the Body) ascend in the Fasciculus Gracilis
- The central processes of the primary afferent do not synapse and go straight up the dorsal column ipsilaterally

# Somatosensory Tracts in the Brainstem

- This is at the level of the lower closed medulla, where the pyramidal decussation is found
- The Fasciculus Gracilis and Cuneatus are found in the most dorsal region of the medulla, in the same place that they are found in the spinal cord
- The blue circles in the lateral part of the white matter are the spinothalamic tracts, found lateral to the decussation of the Pyramids (found slightly more dorsally as to where they are found in the Spinal Cord)

![%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.28.19.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.28.19.png)

- This is a section through the upper part of the closed medulla
- There is a synapse between the dorsal column axon (first order neurons) and the neurons in the dorsal column nucleus (second order neurons).
- At the top of the dorsal column, at the level of the upper closed medulla, is a nucleus which is named after each dorsal column.
- The medial nucleus is the nucleus gracilis
- The lateral nucleus is the nucleus cuneatus
- These nuclei contain the cell bodies of the second order neurones that project anterior to the central canal and decussate to synapse on third order neurones in the medial aspect of the medulla on the contralateral side to form the medial lemniscus.
- The Spinothalamic Tracts are still found laterally in the same position that they were found in the lower closed medulla
- Second Order Afferents of the Dorsal Column/Medial Lemniscus Pathway = Internal Arcuate Fibres

![%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.30.17.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.30.17.png)

- This shows the back of the spinal cord and medulla
- The bump on the top of the fasciculus gracilis (column found either side of the median fissure) is where the nucleus gracilis is found
- From the synapse, the second order neurons have axons which cross the midline ventrally and form the medial lemniscus which go up towards the thalamus
- The gracile nuclei neurons decussate and go into the ventral part of the medial lemniscus
- The cuneate nuclei decussate and go into the dorsal part of the medial lemniscus
- The medial lemniscus is therefore a large somatosensory bundle travelling up towards the thalamus
- The spinothalamic tract is still in the same position

![%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.31.28.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.31.28.png)

- This is a section through the open medulla (olives and fourth ventricle)
- The spinothalamic tracts are still lateral to the medial lemnisci
- The Medial Lemniscus and Spinothalamic Tracts have not changed position within the Brainstem from the Closed Medulla and are comprised of second order neurons projecting to the thalamus
- The Medial Lemniscus is curved triangular shaped, with its base found just posterior to the Pyramids and its apex found centrally within the medulla

![%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.32.14.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.32.14.png)

- This is a section through the lower pons
- There are lots of corticospinal tract axons broken up into bundles (red circles ventrally)
- Dorsal to these axons are where the great somatosensory fibres of the Spinothalamic and Dorsal Column/Medial Lemniscus Tracts are found
- The DC/ML and Spinothalamic Tracts are now flattened and stretched laterally.
- Whilst inferiorly, the spinothalamic tracts were found anterolateral to the DC/ML, they are now lateral to each other, in the same coronal plane as they have moved closer together (as they are projecting to the same region of the thalamus)

![%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.33.41.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.33.41.png)

- This is a cross-section through the midbrain at the superior colliculus (top) - White matter stains dark whilst grey matter stains light
- The substantia nigra is just dorsal to the crus cerebri
- The medial lemnisci are lateral to the red nuclei, and the spinothalamic tracts are further  dorsolateral/posterolateral to these
- Anteriorly, the Medial Lemnisci and Spinothalamic Tracts are in contact with one another as they project to the same nucleus in the thalamus
- The cerebral aqueduct is surrounded by periaqueductal grey
- Periaqueductal grey acts as a descending analgesic system, which 'turns off' pain perception
- This is one reason why pain is only noticed some time after an injury
- Information from the cerebral cortex conveys the severity of a situation and can turn off nociception by sending axons/activating axons that project to the periaqueductal grey, which in turn projects to the medulla. The medulla then projects to the spinal cord to turn off nociceptive processing in the superficial dorsal horn to make you not feel pain until after the event has passed.
- PAG can be stimulated electrically, resulting in profound systemic analgesia

# Conditions Affecting the Spinothalamic Tracts

### Syringomyelia

- A fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) forms around the central canal usually in the cervical part of the spinal cord, commonly due to trauma or idiopathically
- The formation of the Syrinx results in the loss of decussating second order fibres going into the spinothalamic tracts from the superficial dorsal horn, which leads to loss of pain and temperature sensation over affected segments (Nociceptive Information from that segment cannot feed into the Spinothalamic Tracts)
- This is normally in the upper limbs bilaterally as it occurs in the cervical region normally
- The sensation from below the lesion is unaffected as second order neurones are able to decussate below the syrinx to enter the spinothalamic tract
- The spinothalamic tracts themselves and dorsal columns are undamaged, only second order decussating neurones are damaged at the level at which the syrinx is found. Second Order Neurons that have already decussated inferiorly are unaffected
- The corticospinal tracts are also unaffected

![%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.38.14.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.38.14.png)

### Ventrolateral Cordotomy

- This is deliberate lesioning in order to destroy ascending spinothalamic tracts for pain relief in terminally ill patients by ablating the ventrolateral white matter
- It results in pain relief as well as loss of temperature and conscious proprioception from segments below the lesion (often several segments below where the lesion was introduced) whilst not affecting the corticospinal tracts and hence, motor function.
- If the patient lives for 3-8 weeks more, the pain returns
- The pain retuning is not due to the spinothalamic tracts regenerating as there is no regeneration in the CNS
- The fact that the pain returns therefore suggests that there are other pathways which convey nociceptive information up towards the forebrain
- However, these are clearly not used for most of the time as a ventrolateral cordotomy would otherwise not work in the first place

# Other Nuclei Relevant to Pain

### Parabrachial Nucleus

- This shows a section through the rostral pons and shows the fourth ventricle and parts of cerebellum as well
- The corticospinal axons are ventral with the great somatosensory pathways behind them
- Near the floor of the fourth ventricle, the parabrachial nuclei are found (between the anterior aspect of superior cerebellar Peduncle and 4th Ventricle)
- It is medial to the superior cerebellar peduncle and lateral to the fourth ventricle
- They are very important for nociception above the level of the superficial dorsal horn, particularly in experimental animals (They convey nociceptive information to the Cerebral Cortex in pathways other than the Spinothalamic Tract)
- The pneumotaxic centre is also found in this region

![%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.41.56.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_14.41.56.png)

### Modulation of Pain

- Nociceptive Transmission and Processing of Nociceptive Information in the Superficial Dorsal Horn can be turned down by collaterals from Mechanoceptive Aδ Fibres (which synapse deep in the Dorsal Horn) or up or down by fibres in Descending Tracts from the Brainstem

![Screenshot 2021-11-01 at 16.02.23.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screenshot_2021-11-01_at_16.02.23.png)

### Raphe Nuclei

- Neurons using monoamines as their transmitter have many different functions
- Neurons that use 5-HT as their transmitter are found in the raphe nuclei, in the midline of the brainstem (between the 2 Medial Lemnisci), extending down the entirety of the brainstem
- Raphe nuclei contain a lot of serotonergic neurons, which project all over the CNS, including down the spinal cord
- The Raphe Nucleus Magnus is found in the Open Medulla between the Medial Lemnisci.
- Periaqueductal Grey projects axons to the Raphe Nucleus Magnus, which projects axons down the spinal cord. This allows the Raphe Nuclei to control nociceptive transmission in the superficial dorsal horn, thus affecting the gain of the nociceptive information going into the superficial dorsal horn.
- They can therefore increase or decrease the gain, resulting in more or less pain
- They therefore modulate pain transmission and motor functions in the spinal cord
- The Serotonergic nature of neurones within the Raphe Nuclei means that drugs that increase the concentration of 5-HT in the synapse (E.g SSRIs) can reduce the gain of nociceptive information into the superficial dorsal horn, reducing pain. These can sometimes be useful in the management of Chronic Pain

### Locus Ceruleus

- In the upper part of the pons close to the parabrachial nuclei (Just anterior to the anterolateral edge of the 4th Ventricle), the locus ceruli are found
- It is the main Noradrenergic Nucleus of the CNS
- This sends noradrenergic axons all over the CNS, influencing pain, memory and wakefulness
- The descending fibres that project down the spinal cord from these nuclei have an analgesic effect, as they turn down the gain on the processing of nociceptive information in the superficial dorsal horn
- The Locus Cerleus, like the Raphe Nucleus Magnum, is also controlled by axons from the Periaqueductal Grey, which is in turn controlled by axons from the Cerebral Cortex

![%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screenshot_2021-07-19_at_21.00.28.png](%5B027%5D%20Brainstem%20I%2087d6a8937c8241ed971f72430f336d2c/Screenshot_2021-07-19_at_21.00.28.png)

### Congenital Insensitivity to Pain

- This results in a large degree of self-harm and is an extreme evolutionary disadvantage as pain is a protective sensation to protect against injury
- There are two types of pain:
1. Physiological Pain - Protective function that prevents an individual from carrying out harmful/damaging tasks
2. Neuropathic Pain - Pain that arises due to damage to Nerve Damage/Inflammation and hence, is pathological (no protective function)
- Can be caused by a mutation in the SCN9A gene

# Afferent Fibres in Cranial Nerves

- Sensory fibres in Cranial Nerves have their Cell bodies in Ganglia, found along the course of the Cranial Nerve
- The Central Processes of Cranial Nerve Sensory Fibres originate in Cranial Ganglia and end in Cranial Nuclei

### Trigeminal Nerve

- The trigeminal nerve (CN V) is the great somatosensory cranial nerve of the head, which therefore must have somatosensory nuclei in the brainstem
- The trigeminal nerve supplies sensory fibres to:
- The face
• The ophthalmic division (cornea included)
• The maxillary division (including nasal cavity)
• The mandibular division (including oral cavity)
- The trigeminal sensory nuclei receive all the somatosensory information from all cranial nerves that contain somatosensory fibres.
- The primary sensory afferents to the trigeminal sensory nuclei have their cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion, found in the middle cranial fossa. This is by far the largest sensory ganglion in the body
- They contain the primary afferent cell bodies that are mostly projecting their central processes to end in the trigeminal nuclei.
- The trigeminal nuclei extend all the way along the brainstem and is comprised of 3 sensory nuclei
• Midbrain: Mesencephalic Nucleus (Extends into Midbrain)
• Pons: Chief/Principal Sensory nucleus (It is more circular than the other two nuclei, which are more cylindrical)
• Medulla: Spinal nucleus (Very Long Nucleus. This extends all the way down to the spinal cord, where it is continuous with the superficial dorsal horn)
- They are therefore a long set of nuclei that receive information from the trigeminal ganglion
- The primary afferent cell bodies in the trigeminal ganglion will give rise to different primary afferent fibres (e.g. an Aβ fibre which conveys discriminative touch from the upper lip)
- The central sensory processes of these axons go to the brainstem via the Sensory Root of the Trigeminal Nerve and ascend/descend in the Spinal Tract of the Trigeminal Nerve to end in the caudal part of a given trigeminal nucleus
- Chief nuclei receive the central process of a cell body that sends out Aβ fibres
- Spinal nuclei receive the central processes of a cell body that sends out c-fibres due to the continuous nature of the Spinal Nucleus with the Superficial Dorsal Horn which also receives c-fibres from Spinal Nerves.
- Nociceptive information from the distribution of the trigeminal nerve is received by the spinal nucleus (notably the caudal aspect)
- The Mesencephalic Nucleus contains the cell bodies of Primary Afferents that innervate proprioceptors for the Jaw. Hence, it is the only region of the body where primary afferents arise/originate in the CNS
- Sensation received by the spinal trigeminal nuclei:
• Mesencephalic nucleus: Proprioception of the Jaw
• Chief nucleus: Discriminative touch on the ipsilateral side (incoming trigeminal nerve fibres end on the same side) via Aβ fibres that innervate Meissener's Corpuscles 
• Spinal nucleus: Crude touch, temperature and **pain** from the ipsilateral face

# Conditions Affecting the Trigeminal Nerve

### Trigeminal Neuralgia - Not Covered in Much Detail

- The basilar artery can be seen going up the front of the pons
- At the top of the pons, the basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries
- Before doing this, the superior cerebellar arteries are given off
- The sensory roots of the trigeminal nerve pass in between the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries
- Trigeminal neuralgia is often caused by the superior cerebellar artery irritating the trigeminal nerve root
- Trigeminal neuralgia results in a burning sensation on one side of the face, normally one or two of the trigeminal divisions unilaterally is involved.
- Neuralgia = pain felt along the course of a nerve
- Neuralgia is a neuropathic pain which means that it is not controlled by typical analgesics
- It is chronic, and may never go away
- It can be solved by taking a Teflon sponge and putting it between the nerve and the artery
- Alternatively, the artery can be anchored elsewhere to pull it away from the nerve
- As it occurs in the posterior cranial fossa, there are many nerves and blood vessels in close proximity to the pathology and thus the neurosurgeons have to be highly skilled to perform this

### Post-Herpetic Neuralgia

- Varicella zoster virus can remain latent in primary sensory neurons for many years, becoming activated occasionally and may be successful in establishing infection depending on the state of the immune system
- Any event resulting in downregulation of the immune response or immune system strength, will result in the virus coming out of the sensory neurons, into the skin and replicate in the skin cells and cause blistering (as seen in primary chickenpox)
- This normally occurs over the distribution of just one nerve AKA a single dermatome
- It can be any division of the trigeminal nerve or spinal nerve
- In the image below, the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve has been affected by shingles (reactivation of herpes zoster virus)
- It is treated with anti-viral medication
- The inflammation due to the viral infection causes changes in the trigeminal sensory nuclei
- This can lead to a post-herpetic trigeminal neuralgia which can be chronic with little to no treatment options (Neuralgia usually originates in one/two of the divisions of the Trigeminal Nerve, on one side of the face only)
