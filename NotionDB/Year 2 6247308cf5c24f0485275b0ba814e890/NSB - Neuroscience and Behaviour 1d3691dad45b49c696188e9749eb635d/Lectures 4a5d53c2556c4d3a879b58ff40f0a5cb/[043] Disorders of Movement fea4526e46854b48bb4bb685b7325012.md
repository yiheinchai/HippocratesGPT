# [043] Disorders of Movement

# Motor Disturbances in Disease

- Spasticity ‚Äì a resistance to movement which is unidirectional and velocity dependent
- Rigidity ‚Äì a resistance to movement which is bidirectional and not velocity dependent
- Ataxia ‚Äì loss of co-ordination in the action of muscles
- Akinesia, hypokinesia or hyperkinesia ‚Äì no movement, reduced movement or excessive movement
- Apraxia ‚Äì the loss of purposeful movement ‚Äì a loss of motor planning
- Weakness ‚Äì movements lack force and are tiring to make

# Distribution and Development of Abnormalities

- The Distribution of Motor Abnormalities allows lesions to be localised to:
- Single nerve innervation.
- Single limb
- Bilateral proximal musculature.
- Unilateral upper and lower limbs.
- Global: across entire body.
- The Development of Motor Abnormalities over time indicates a progressive pathology such as:
- An immediate loss or change in motor control indicates a Cerebrovascular Event/A Stroke most commonly and sometimes, a physical tumour.
- A tumour usually produces slowly progressive symptoms and signs.

# Descending Motor Pathways and Diagnosing Lesions

- Corticospinal tract: through which cerebellum and basal ganglia
exert.
- Vestibulospinal tract: important in balance and postural control.
- When localising spinal cord lesions, it is important to consider where the Main Descending and Ascending Tracts run in the Spinal Cord and what regions of Grey Matter these tracts project to

- Localising lesion is 1st step in making a correct diagnosis.
- Useful conceptually to divide nervous system into functional subdivisions. 2 functionally distinct divisions:
1. Lower motoneuron (LMN): ùõº motoneurons.
2. Upper motoneuron (UMN): motor cortex and corticospinal tract (Pyramidal Neurons).
- LMN and UMN lesions produce entirely different symptoms.

---

# Lower Motorneuron (LMN) and Lesions

- ùõº-motoneurons loss or damage produces LMN Lesions/Signs.
- LMN Syndrome is revealed by testing the Muscle Stretch Reflex via a Tendon Tap Test to test the integrity of ùõº-Motor Neurons.
- If the Px is Hyporeflexive (Weak Tendon-Tap Response) and has weak voluntary movements, this is a sign of a LMN Lesion
- LMN signs accompany damage to muscle spindles, primary afferents, spinal cord, ùõº-motoneurons, motoneuron axons, NMJ and muscle as these are also components involved in the Muscle Stretch reflex and hence, damage to these components can also produce Hyporeflexia.
- Therefore, whilst Hyporeflexia is an indicative sign of a LMN Lesion, it is not Pathognomonic (LMN Signs does not always indicate ùõº-Motor Neuron Disease/Damage)
- Therefore, LMN Syndromes involve much more than just the ùõº-motor neurons

### LMN Signs

1. Muscle Weakenss
2. Weakness of Voluntary Movement
- 1+2 = Flaccid Paralysis (Loss of Muscle Tone)
1. Hyporeflexia (Weak Tendon Rap Reflex)
2. Muscle Atrophy (Due to denervation)
3. Muscle Fasciculation (Spontaneous Activity of Individual Motor Units causing Muscle Fascicles to contract)
4. Muscle Fibrillation (Spontaneous activation of Individual Muscle Fibres - Cannot be seen usually but can be detected using an EMG)

### LMN Lesion (Indicated by Hyporeflexia/Weak Muscle Stretch Reflex) Causes

- Peripheral neuropathies: damage to
nerve in periphery.
- Injury in dorsal/ventral root: e.g.
herniated vertebral disc.
- Poliomyelitis: virus kills motoneurons.
- Myasthenia gravis: ‚Üì neuromuscular transmission.
- Muscular dystrophy: primary muscle disease.
- LMN disease cause muscle weakness, and if muscle loses innervation, muscle atrophy.

---

# Upper Motor Neuron Lesions

- Always involve corticospinal tract (with or without rubrospinal tract and reticulospinal tract).
- As the Corticospinal Tract is commonly known as the Pyramidal Tract, UMN Lesion Signs are also known as Pyramidal Signs
- Damage may be in motor cortex or any part of descending corticospinal tract (Most often in the
lateral columns in the Spinal Cord).
- They do not affect individual muscles (which can be the case with LMN Lesions) due to the Divergence seen in the Corticospinal Tract, where 1 Pyramidal Neuron innervates Multiple Different Œ±-Motor Neurons/Muscle Fibres.
- Muscles affected as groups that can involve whole limbs or whole side of body.
- Damage to other parts of motor system (e.g. basal ganglia and
cerebellum) does not produce this pattern of deficits.

### Signs

1. UMN lesions cause weakness ‚Üí Voluntary movements are weak and tiring to produce.
2. UMN lesions cause unusually brisk muscle stretch (tendon jerk) reflexes (Hyperreflexia) due to disinhibitory effect of UMN Lesion on Spinal Motor Neurons.
- 1+2 = Spastic Paralysis (Weaker Voluntary Movements yet Increased Muscle Tone)
- Muscle tone is relatively normal here, but there is exaggerated reflex contraction to muscle stretch.
- UMN lesions reverse some Flexor Reflex Afferent (AŒ¥) driven reflexes (E.g Flexion Withdrawal Crossed Extension produces Extension of Ipsilateral Limb and Flexion of Contralateral Limb).
- UMN lesions show no signs of muscle denervation.
- Spasticity of gait (scissor walking): The Subject walks with flexed hips and knees, plantar flexed ankles
- An increase in muscle tone of the agonists and antagonists leads to stiffness in limbs.
- There is Inward rotation of each lower limb, meaning the Px walks by circumduction at hip, to give a swivelling movement.
- Bing sign: tests for UMN lesions - Multiple Pinpricks on the Dorsum of the foot causes the foot to moves towards the Stimulus instead of away (Dorsiflexion and Foot Spreading vs Plantarflexion)

### Why do UMN Lesions cause Hyperreflexia

- There are significant numbers of inhibitory interneurons in the spinal circuitry which control/synapse on Œ±-motor neurons.
- They include the 1a inhibitory interneurons, the 1b inhibitory interneurons and the Renshaw cells.
- They outnumber the excitatory interneurons in spinal cord so that the predominant drive on Œ± Motor Neurons is Inhibitory
- All of these spinal inhibitory interneurons are modulated by descending, excitatory corticospinal influences, meaning that normally, there is Greater Inhibitory than Excitatory Drive provided by Interneurons on Œ±-motor Neurons here (Œ±-Motor Neurons tend to be more inhibited normally due to Net Inhibitory Drive from Interneurons).
- When there is Damage to the Corticospinal Tract, the loss of descending excitation to all spinal interneurons leads to net disinhibition of spinal motoneurons as this Net Inhibitory Drive from Interneurons onto Œ± Motor Neurons is lost ‚Äì Œ± Motor Neurons become more excitable.
- This means that when Œ± Motor Neurons are activated in Reflex Circuits, they produce more active/pronounced responses, causing Hyperreflexia (Brisk and Exaggerated Reflexes)
- Tendon tap responses and others are stronger but voluntary control of the motoneurons is weak or absent through the damaged or lost corticospinal tract which is the main tract mediating Voluntary Movement.
- This Hyperreflexia does not occur immediately after an UMN Lesion develops, mainly as there are additional synaptic changes that contribute to this Hyperreflexia/Hyperexcitability of Œ± Motor Neurons in the Long Term (Initial Hyperreflexia tends to be mainly due to Disinhibition of Œ±-Motor Neuron due to loss of Net Inhibitory Drive from Interneurons)

### Why do UMN Lesions Reverse  some Flexion Reflexes?

- One part of the flexion withdrawal reflex to a strong stimulus on the sole of the foot is plantar flexion, causing the toes push down upon the standing surface to raise the sole away from the noxious stimulus.
- This is tested clinically by drawing a blunt point across the sole of the foot to elicit the Flexion Withdrawal Crossed Extension Reflex (Babinski Reflex).
- Normally, the ankle will plantar flex. but with UMN lesions, the Damage to the Corticospinal Tract reverses the reflex as there is the loss of inhibition of the Dorsiflexion Response to the Noxious Stimulus, producing Dorsiflexion and fanning of the toes if the Babinski Reflex is elicited .
- This sign is also seen in babies < 6 months before the corticospinal tract has myelinated and become fully functional but in adults.
- Once the Corticospinal Tracts become myelinated and the baby can walk, Plantarflexion becomes appropriate as the Dorsiflexion Response is suppressed/inhibited

### UMN Sx According to Region

- Assessment cannot be once injury has occurred as Spinal Shock produces Loss of Reflexes (Typical of LMN Lesion).
- It must be done days-weeks after once system has compensated and Hyperreflexia and Spasticity has developed.
- Spinal Cord Lesions produce effects on structures at the level of the lesion and Regions innervated by Spinal Segments below it
- Spinal cord lesions produce :
1. Immediate Loss of voluntary movement.
2. Immediate Total anaesthesia
3. Initially after Spinal Cord Injury, there will be temporary loss of reflexes (spinal shock) followed by hyper-reflexia after 1-4 Weeks due to Loss of Inhibitory Interneuron Drive to Œ±-Motor Neurons and Synaptic Alterations which contribute to Hyperexcitability.
4. There is the gradual development of Spasticity over 4 weeks - 1 year
- Effects will be Ipsilateral to the Lesion as the Corticospinal Tracts have already Decussated more superiorly in the Lower Closed Medulla, before they reach the Spinal Cord
- Complete Cervical transections produce quadriplegia (Loss of Movement in All 4 Limbs due to Damage to the Brachial and Lumbosacral Plexi).
- Transections below cervical enlargement = Paraplegia of Lower Limbs (as innervation to Upper Limbs is not affected as Cervical Enlargement is where Brachial Plexus arises).
- For Descending Motor and Ascending Sensory Pathways, Damage Above/Proximal to Decussation Produces Contralateral Effects whereas Damage Distal/Inferior to the Decussation produces Ipsilateral Effects

**Brainstem Lesion:**

1. UMN deficits present on contralateral side of body (This is because the Corticospinal Tracts have not yet decussated and hence, innervation to the Contralateral Side is compromised here - This includes Corticospinal fibres that decussate to enter Motor Cranial Nerve Nuclei to control the Head and Neck).
2. At the level of the Lesion, there is often Ipsilateral LMN deficits for cranial nerve nuclei found here as Fibres from Cranial Nerve Motor Nuclei (which do not decussate and hence, project to the Ipsilateral Side) could be damaged at this level as they project through the Brain Stem (This ipsilateral LMN Lesions to CN Nuclei can also accompany Contralateral LMN Lesions to CN Nuclei found At or inferior/Distal to the Lesion)

**Lesions of Internal Capsule and Cerebral Cortex**

- Damage is often caused by cerebrovascular disease (stroke) with 3 main causes: thrombosis, embolism, haemorrhage.
- Lateral Aspect of the Cerebral/Motor Cortex is supplied by the Middle Cerebral Artery (Head to Trunk) and Medial Aspect of the Motor Cortex (Hips and Legs) is supplied by the Anterior Cerebral Artery
- This means that MCA Stroke can cause Local UMN Lesion Signs for a region of the Upper Body (Depending on the Affected MCA Branch and what Cortical Region(s) of M1 it supplies)
- ACA Strokes can cause Local UMN Lesion Signs for a region of the Lower Body (Depending on the Affected ACA Branch and what specific Cortical Region(s) of M1 it supplies)
- Cortical Strokes are often extremely localised in their damage and hence, do not tend to cause UMN Signs affecting the entirely of one half of the Body as this would require a simultaneous MCA and ACA Stroke which is very rare
- Lesions of cerebral cortex also cause apraxia (inability to conceptualise and plan a movement) often due to damage to the PMC (SMA and PMA).
- The Internal capsule and Other Deep Structures of the Brain such as the Thalamus are supplied by small, Penetrating Arteries from the MCA (Notably the Striate Artery from the MCA)
- Occlusions of the Striate Artery can compromise Blood supply to the Posterior Limb, where Corticospinal Axons are found descending following their Convergence, producing significant UMN Motor Lesions.
- As Sensory Fibres also ascend in the Posterior Limb (Clustered More towards the Posterior 1/3rd of the Posterior Limb), Larger Lesions of the Striate Artery can compromise the Anterior Corticospinal Fibres and the Posterior Somatosensory Fibres, producing Mixed Motor and Sensory UMN Sign
- Occlusions of a single penetrating branch produces a small Infarct.
- Infarcts < 20 mm diameter = Lacunar Stroke
- Lacunar Stroke in the Posterior Limb of the Internal Capsule can produce a Pure Motor Stroke affecting the Entire Contralateral Side of the Body due to Damage to the Converged Corticospinal Axons without damaging the Sensory Fibres found more Posteriorly in the Posterior Limb (Hemiplegia/Hemiparesis - Complete/Partial Loss of Motor Control to one half of the body)

### Diseases of Basal Ganglia and Cerebellum

- Produces unique and particular symptoms.
- Diseases in these systems cannot be characterised using LMN and UMN concepts.

---

# Basal Ganglia Disease

- Produce dyskinesia (bad movement) either:
1. Hyperkinesia: excess, involuntary spontaneous movement.
2. Hypokinesia: lack of spontaneous movement, slowing of
voluntary movement.
- They do not produce muscular weakness (they do not impact innervation by targeting motor neurons) or apraxia (movements can be conceptualised as there is no affect on the Cerebral Cortex).
- Disease and Damage of the Basal Ganglia was traditionally considered to be outside the Corticospinal/Pyramidal System so Basal Ganglia Injury and Disease Signs are often seen as Extrapyramidal Signs (Despite the fact that the Basal Ganglia exerts significant influence on movement via the Corticospinal and Non-Corticospinal Descending Systems such as the Reticulospinal Tract)

---

# Hyperkinetic Movements and Disorders

### Hyperkinetic Movements

- **Chorea**: continuing series of rapid, jerky movements that are fragments of purposeful movements.
- **Athetosis**: continual uncontrolled writhing.
- **Dystonia**: extreme contractions (often long duration and static) forcing unusual movements and long held and often painful posture.
- **Ballismus**: jumping about.
- **Tics**: repeated, stereotypes fragments of movement (can involve vocalisations)

### Basal Ganglia Disease with Hyperkinetic Sx

**Ballism**

- Degeneration of subthalamic nucleus, leading to disinhibition of movement via
indirect pathway
- Ballism = Bilateral Degeneration and Hemiballism = Unilateral Degeneration
- This is because there is reduced Glutamatergic Stimulation of the GPi by the Subthalamic Nucleus, which disinhibits the Thalamic (Thalamus becomes hyperexcited), causing hyperexcitement/overactivation of SMA and hence, leads to Hyperkinesia
- This is characterised by large amplitude, involuntary limb movements (most commonly in lower limbs)

**Huntington's Disease**

- Degeneration of Medium Spiny Neurons in striatum that express D2 and hence, are the source of the Indirect Pathway, causing Choreiform Movements.
- This causes reduced inhibition of GPe, which increases inhibition of the Subthalamic Nucleus, reducing Excitation of GPi and SNr via the Subthalamic Nucleus and directly via inhibition of GPi by GPe
- This reduces thalamic inhibition, causing excessive Thalamic Excitatory output to the SMA which produces Hyperkinesia
- This loss of the Indirect Pathway causes reduced inhibition of movement, causing Hyperkinesia
- Characterised by sudden, brief involuntary twitches
- Affect all parts of body so that Voluntary movements slowed.

### Basal Ganglia Disease with Hypokinetic Sx

**Parkinson‚Äôs Disease**

- Degeneration of dopamine producing neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta.
- Low dopamine input to striatum (Dopaminergic Drive) decreases excitation of the Direct Pathway and decreases Inhibition of the Indirect Pathway, meaning the Px cannot energise movement through both of these pathways
- The net effect of Low Dopaminergic Drive on the Direct and Indirect Pathways increases Inhibitory Drive from the GPi to the Thalamus via reduced Inhibition of GPi (Direct) and Increases disinhibition of Subthalamic Nucleus, increasing GPi Stimulation (Indirect)
- This increased Inhibitory Outflow from GPi to the Thalamus decreases excitatory output of the SMA, producing Hypokinesia (Reduced Outflow via M1 to produce movement)

**Sx:**

- Bradykinesia (Movements are slow)
- Resting Tremor - This is notably of the Upper Limb, producing circular movements of the hands and fingers (Pill-rolling Tremor)
- Rigidity to Displacement of the Limbs - This produces segmented/on and off Resistance/rigidity between movements known as Cogwheel Rigidity (Movements occur in series of rapid/discrete steps)
- Postural instability.

**Drug Therapies:**

- Levodopa (L- DOPA) - Dopamine Precursor that crosses the BBB to allow Residual Dopaminergic Neurons from the SNc to maintain Dopaminergic Drive onto the Striatum
- Dopamine Agonists - Stimulate D1 Receptors to increase activity of Direct Pathway
- Monoamine Oxidase-B Inhibitors - Reduce Dopamine metabolism to maintain [Dopamine] in the Striatum

**Surgical Treatment**: 

- Deep brain stimulation (DBS) via
electrodes implanted and stimulated long term, close to basal ganglia circuitry can restore thalamic excitability and restore movements by increasing excitatory drive to the SMA and hence, M1 and Corticospinal Tract.

# Cerebellar Lesion Signs

- Balance is impaired, so patients adopt a wide stance, for extra stability.
- Cerebellar Control is Ipsilateral due to Decussating of Cerebellar Fibres on their way to Thalamus/M1 and Decussating of Corticospinal Fibres from M1 to Motor Neurons
- As the Flocculo-nodular Lobe/Vestibulocerebellum controls balance and eye movements, damage usually results in deficits in visual tracking, nystagmus (oscillating eye movements at rest), Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex errors and balance problems
- Vermis and Pars Intermedia (Spinocerebellum) adjust ongoing/active movement of the Entire Body.
- The Anterior Lobe Vermis is particular sensitive in Alcohol Misuse and degenerates rapidly here in Alcoholics.
- Anterior Lobe Vermis Lesions cause Gait Ataxia (Hallmark Sign) as Proprioceptive information cannot be coordinated with vestibular information, causing agonist/antagonist relationships in the lower limbs and trunk to break down and balance to be impaired.
- This means the Px adopts a wide stance for additional stability to compromise for their poor balance
- Cerebellar Hemispheres/Pontocerebellum help coordinate planning of limb movements, notably of reaching movements of the Upper Limb, as they project to M1 and PM notably.
- Damage to the Cerebellar Hemisphere leads to Limb Ataxia and Intention Tremor (Slow, High Amplitude Tremor that is greatest at the end of a voluntary/purposeful movement but not during rest - Often tested by Asking Px to touch nose, point to examiner and then repeat)

### Signs

- **D**ysdiadochokinesia
- **A**taxia
- **N**ystagmus
- **I**ntention tremor
- **S**lurred speech
- **H**ypotonia

**DANISH**
