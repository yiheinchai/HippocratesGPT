# Descending Motor Pathways

### Corticospinal Tract

- Important for voluntary movement especially of limbs.
- This is organised into the Lateral and Anterior/Ventral Corticospinal Tracts
- The Lateral Corticospinal Tracts contains Decussated Fibres from the Motor Cortex and Somatosensory Cortex.
- Fibres from the Motor Cortex in the Lateral Corticospinal Tract enter Lateral Aspects of the Ventral Horn where they control Distal Muscles and control the Fine Movements of the Distal Limbs (Hand/Feet and Digits)
- Fibres from the Somatosensory Cortex within the Lateral Corticospinal Tract travel medially to synapse on Interneuron Pools in the Dorsal Horn which modulate Sensory Inflow from Receptors before it ascends to reach the Brain or influences other Interneurons involved in the Control of Movement
- Anterior/Ventral Corticospinal Tract is found in the Anterior White Matter, either side of the Anterior Medial Fissure, containing IpsilateralUndecussated Fibres
- These project into posteromedially into Medially Positioned Interneurons in the Ventral Horn, which influence Medial Motor Neurons
- Hence, the Anterior Corticospinal Tract influences Proximal Muscles (E.g Postural Muscles)

### Rubrospinal Tract

- The Position of the Rubrospinal Tract is found just ventral/anterior to the Lateral Corticospinal Tract but overlaps significantly with it
- It is believed to work similarly to the Lateral Corticospinal Tract but its exact role is unknown.
- It does not tend to project to Motor Neuron Pools but does projects medially to Interneurons between the Dorsal and Ventral Horns which in turn project to Motor Neuron Pools to influence Movements.

### Reticulospinal Tract

- Fibres of the Reticulospinal Tract originate from the Pontine or Medullary Reticular Formations
- Fibres from the Pontine Reticular Formation form the Medial Reticulospinal Tract in the Ipsilateral Ventral Aspect of the Ventral White Matter (Near Anterior Border of Ventromedial White Matter)
- It projects posteromedially to Interneuron Pools that control the Proximal/Axial Musculature (particularly trunk) and its therefore is involved in the Maintenance of Posture
- Fibres from the Medullary Reticular Formation contribute to both the Ipsilateral and Contralateral Lateral Reticulospinal Tracts (Some Fibres decussate and some do not), found just Anteromedial to the Rubrospinal Tract (Just Lateral to Ventral Interneurons at the Posterior Aspect of the Ventral Horn)
- Fibres from the Lateral Reticulospinal Tract project to Interneuron Pools that control the Proximal/Axial Musculature (particularly trunk) and its therefore is involved in the Maintenance of Posture and Locomotion

### Vestibulospinal Tract

- These originate in the Vestibular Nuclei and project to contribute to the Ipsilateral and Contralateral Medial and Lateral Vestibulospinal Tracts
- Medial Vestibulospinal Tracts are found Posterior to the Anterior Corticospinal Tracts, just Ventral/Anterior to the Central Canal (Lamina X)
- Lateral Vestibulospinal Tract is found in a similar Position to the Medial Reticulospinal Tract, just Anteromedial to the Ventral Horn within the Ventromedial White Matter
- The Medial and Lateral Vestibulospinal Tracts project to Interneurons in the Medial Aspect of the Ventral Horn where they control Proximal Postural Muscles to regulate Posture and Balance
- Lateral pathways: corticospinal and rubrospinal.
- Ventromedial pathways: vestibulospinal and tectospinal tracts - These control the Posture of the Head and Neck.

# Motor Regions of Cerebral Cortex

- Motor Areas of the Cerebral Cortex were defined based on the Minimum intensity of Stimulation required to produce movement
- From Low to High Threshold (Low to High Current) it goes:
1. M1 = Primary Motor Cortex = Brodmann Area 4
- It is located in the Precentral Gyrus, immediately anterior to the Central Sulcus
1. PM =  Premotor Area (Immediately Anterior to M1) = Brodmann Area 6
2. SMA = Supplementary Motor Area = Brodmann Area 6
- Other Non-Motor Areas of the Cerebral Cortex can also produce movement when stimulated but this is likely due to strong/numerous Cortico-Cortical Connections between these areas and Motor Areas
1. S1 = Primary Somatosensory Cortex.
- This has strong Cortico-Cortical Connections with M1
1. Area 5 = Brodmann Area 5 of Posterior Parietal Cortex
2. Area 7 =  Brodmann Area 7 of Posterior Parietal Cortex
- Area 5 and 7 are where Egocentric and Allocentric Visual Spacial Coding are determined, feeding forward into the Motor Regions to help an individual plan movements
- Allocentric Spacial Coding encodes information about the location of one object relatively to the location of other objects (independent from your body position
- Egocentric Spacial Coding encodes information about the location of objects in respective to the Individual's body

1. Prefrontal Cortex
- Premotor cortex (PMC) is comprised of the premotor area (PM) (lateral part) and supplementary motor area (SMA) (medial part - extends down the Medial Surface of the Precentral Gyrus).

# Thalamocortical Connections

- Ventral lateral nucleus (VL): major input to primary motor cortex
(M1).
- Ventral anterior nucleus (VA): supplies premotor cortex (PM and
SMA).
- Lateral geniculate: projects to visual cortex.
- Medial geniculate: projects to auditory cortex.

# Corticospinal System

- There is a large cortical territory and hence, number of Corticospinal Neurons dedicated to the Movements of the Fingers, Face and Tongue and very little to the Trunk
- There is significant Corticospinal Projects to the Fingers in order to produce the fine, skilled movements of the Hands whilst much less to the trunk as much less fine movements are needed here
- Within the Pons, Corticospinal Tract gives off Collaterals to the Contralateral Trigeminal Motor Nucleus to supply the Contralateral Muscles of Mastication, in the Midbrain to Contralateral CN III, IV and VI to control Contralateral Extraocular Muscles and in the Medulla to Contralateral CN IX-XII to control other Head and Neck Muscles
- The Majority of Corticospinal Axons decussate to form the Lateral Corticospinal Tract (Larger) whilst the few fibres that do not decussate remain in the Ventral Aspect of the White Matter to form the Anterior/Ventral Corticospinal Tract (Smaller)
- All the Corticospinal Axons project down the Posterior Limb of the Internal Capsule, often deemed to be in the Anterior 2/3rds but some evidence suggests it extends more posteriorly than this (extends into the Caudal 1/3rd) and varies at which level through the Internal Capsule the Cross-Section is Taken
- Cortical stroke: entire territory lost (middle cerebral artery), and loss of movement of hands and arm (Upper Body).
- There is No loss of hip, knee, ankle and toes (Lower Body as these regions are supplied by the anterior cerebral artery).

# Motor Cortex Mapping

- Motor cortex mapping is not a simple 1:1 projection between M1 and Muscles in Various Body Parts, meaning the Somatotropic Organisation of M1 is not as clearly defined
- Whilst there are regions of M1 that tend to project more axons to Motor Neurons controlling a specific location, there is often crossover between these two regions of M1 where M1 Neurons control other Motor Neurons controlling different areas
- This means that there is convergence ****from M1 pyramidal neurons upon spinal motor neurons so that multiple Patches of Pyramidal Neurons from widespread area of M1 converge to synapse on a single Spinal Motor Neuron.
- These Patches of Pyramidal Neurons may be found surrounded by other Neuron Patches supplying other muscle groups in different areas
- This convergence means that if a specific region of M1 is damaged (Limited Cortical Territory Stroke), initial Motor Weakness/Impairment can be compensated for by patches of Pyramidal Neurons in other Cortical Areas that project to a specific motor neuron.
- These undamaged (but fewer) Neurons can increase their synaptic efficacy to allow for substantial recovery of motor function, despite damages to Cortical Areas traditionally associated with a specific region of the body.
- However, convergence means that many Pyramidal Neurons are found packed very close to one another within the Posterior Limb of the Internal Capsule
- This means that Internal Capsular Strokes can damage significant numbers of Pyramidal Neurons from widespread M1 Territories, producing widespread pronounced Contralateral Motor Deficits (Sometimes even Hemiplegia)
- This damage cannot be recovered effectively as it is likely that in Internal Capsular Strokes, Fibres from all areas of M1 are tightly packed together and hence, likely damaged together when they pass through the Internal Capsule (There are no undamaged Pyramidal Neurons originating in widespread Cortical Areas that can provide functional recovery, unlike that is seen in Localised Cortical Strokes)

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 14.52.10.png](%5B041%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Supraspinal%20Control%201%200b02b4ca24314d1bba7afd8a6df6cddd/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_14.52.10.png)

- As well as Convergence, there is also Divergence in the Projection of Pyramidal Neurons
- This means that Pyramidal Neurons branch widely in the Interneuron and Motor Neuron Region of the Spinal Cord, to synapse on many Interneurons and Motor Neurons controlling many widespread muscles
- This further means that territories of M1 associated with Motor Innervation to Specific regions become blurred as One Pyramidal Neuron controls multiple Neurons which control various different Muscles (Divergence) and multiple Pyramidal Neurons from widespread Cortical Areas branch widely and supply an individual muscle (Convergence)

# Primary Motor Cortex

- Simple Mapping of Individual M1 Neurons shows that M1 Neurons code for muscle force so that as firing frequency of the M1 Neurons increases, Muscle Force/Tension increases.
- Some code for ****dynamic ****aspects of force to produce rapid changes in muscle force/tension.
- Most code for dynamic and static aspects of force, providing small contributes to rapid changes/increases in Muscle Tension as firing frequency but also involved in maintaining constant levels of Force/Tension.
- Some code for static aspects of force and maintain constant levels of force (usually constant levels of High Force).
- Recent studies also seem to show that whilst Individual M1 Neurons may code for Muscle Force, Populations of M1 Neurons also code for Directionality of Movements
- Divergence and Convergence of Pyramidal Neurons means that connections between the Corticospinal Tract and Muscle Innervation is extremely complex and overlapping in many areas
- This means that movements of a single muscle are often controlled by  populations of M1 Neurons vs Individual Neurons and therefore, these population must be studied in order to understanding the true motor functions encoded by these Neurons

# Premotor Cortex

- Premotor cortex contains:
1. Premotor area (PM) and supplementary motor area (SMA).
- PM and SMA are important for higher levels of Motor Planning, formulating motor plans that are passed to M1 for delivery/execution by Neurons that descending from M1, down the Spinal Cord, as the Corticospinal Tract
- The PM and SMA both have some direct projections to the Spinal Cord so they can directly influence Spinal neurons but they are particularly important due to their projections to M1
- PM and SMA project to M1 via thalamus.
1. Via thalamus, PM has strong inputs from cerebellum.
2. Via thalamus, SMA has strong inputs from basal ganglia.
- PM is involved with planning movements based on external/sensory
(especially visual) cues.
- The influence of Visual Cues on the Premotor Area is notably because Area 5 and Area 7, which form the Parietal Visual Regions (found Posterior to the Premotor Cortex M) project to the Ventral and Dorsal Aspects of the Premotor Area, conveying Information regarding Egocentric and Allocentric Spacial Coding
- This Spacial Encoding and input into the Premotor Area to enable Motor Plans for visually guided movements to be formulated which produce movements that occur and end in the correct points in space
- These regions also have Feature Extraction abilities so that Movements involving objects can be planned in such a way that they are appropriate to the dimensions of the Object and the nature of the object
- SMA is involved with planning movements based on internally generated strategies that are not based on External/Sensory Cues (e.g. learned sequences of movements)
- The Prefrontal Cortex projects to both the PM and SMA, which provides Executive Control over Motor Function, which provides higher level decision making regarding actions (E.g In what situations would X movement be appropriate vs the SMA/PM which just create the plans for movement and ensures these plans are appropriate regarding objects and the environment)

**Experiment**

- Neurons within PM are continuously active when planning to execute a movement between given an instruction and carrying out the movement, with Activity in PM Neurons decreasing whilst that in M1 Neurons increases when the Movement is being carried out
- PM active in visually cued task.
- SMA active in internally cued task.
- M1 active in both tasks as both the PM and SMA Project to and influence M1 to produce movement.

### Cued Tasks and the Motor Areas

**Experiment**

- During Movements of the Fingers, there is activity in the Contralateral M1 (Due to Activity of Pyramidal Neurons via the Corticospinal Tract) and S1 (Due to Proprioceptive Information from the finger movement feeding into S1)
- Functional imaging studies show primary motor cortex (M1) is active during simple flexion and sequenced movement tasks (simple movement).
- Supplementary motor area is active alongside S1 and M1 during sequenced movement tasks (E.g Performing Movement Sequences that were taught previously)
- If the Subject thinks about/mentally rehearses the sequenced movement tasks but does not actually carry out the movement sequence, SMA is active but M1 and S1 are not active
- Therefore, the SMA is involved in movement planning.
