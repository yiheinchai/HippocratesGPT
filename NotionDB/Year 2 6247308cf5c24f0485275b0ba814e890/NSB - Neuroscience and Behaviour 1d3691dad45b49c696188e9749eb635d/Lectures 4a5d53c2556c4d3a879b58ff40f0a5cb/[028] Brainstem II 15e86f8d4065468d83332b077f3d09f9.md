# [028] Brainstem II

# Trigeminal Sensory Nuclei

### Spinal Nucleus

- This is found at the level of the open medulla, in the dorsolateral aspect.
- In the Caudal part of the Open Medulla, it is found just posterolateral to the Corticospinal Tracts AKA Where the Decussation of the Pyramids ends posteriorly. In the Rostral Part of the Open Medulla, it is located just anteromedially to the Inferior Cerebellar Peduncles
- It is important for nociception and temperature sensation from the face amongst other areas
- The nociceptive fibres end in the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve

### Chief Sensory Nucleus

- The chief nucleus is found at the level of the upper pons and is found just posterolateral to the Spinothalamic Tract
- It receives Aβ fibres which convey discriminative touch information into the brain
- This will end in the chief nucleus in the dorsolateral column

![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.10.49.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.10.49.png)

### Blood Supply to the Dorsolateral Medulla

- On the posterolateral side of the medulla, there is the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) on both sides
- It supplies part of the cerebellum, as well as giving branches into the dorsolateral medulla
- The dorsolateral medulla will die if those branches are damaged or there is lesion to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery
- This results in damage to:
1) The vestibular nuceli which will result in a loss of balance
2) The spinal nucleus resulting in loss of nociception of the ipsilateral face, cornea, nasal + oral cavities and teeth (As CN V does not Decussate)
3) The spinothalamic tract resulting in contralateral loss of nociception and temperature of the contralateral body (Contralateral body as Spinothalamic Tract decussates in the spinal cord/below the Medulla)
4) Inferior cerebellar peduncles resulting in dysdiadochokinesia and ataxia
- This is called Dorsolateral Medullary Syndrome

# Vestibular and Cochlear Nuclei and the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract

- This is at the level of the open medulla
- The vestibular and cochlear fibres (special sense fibres conducting information about balance) arise in the Vestibular Ganglion and Spiral Ganglion end in the vestibular or cochlear nuclei
- The vestibular and cochlear nerve nuclei are close to each other, found in the lateral floor of the 4th Ventricle (Posterior to the Spinal Nucleus and Directly Medial to and in contact with the Inferior Cerebellar Peduncles)
- There are 4 vestibular Nuclei - Only one is drawn in on the diagram
- Visceral afferent fibres convey taste (useful evolutionary) and other information from viscera (E.g Baroreceptors and Chemoreceptors) end in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS)
- The Nucleus of the Solitary Tract is found just medial to the Spinal Nucleus of the Trigeminal Nerve and Anteromedial to the Vestibular Nuclei.
- It has a hole in the middle = solitary tract
- The surrounding nucleus is therefore the nucleus of the solitary tract
- It receives all the visceral afferent information and hence, is important in autonomic reflexes (Blood Pressure and Respiration)
- A lot of the information received is from the vagus nerve. This is in the form of visceral afferent fibres to the GI and respiratory tract
- It also receives fibres from the glossopharyngeal nerve which sense information from the carotid body and sinuses
- Special Visceral Afferents that conduct information regarding Taste pass through the Glossopharyngeal and Facial Nerves and end in the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract, but at a more rostral level than those of the General Visceral Afferent Fibres
- Stimulation of the Vagus Nerve can be used to relieve Sx of conditions like Epilepsy (Reduce fitting), likely by stimulating the NTS, which projects to the Raphe Nuclei and Locus Coeruleus, with stimulation of these Nuclei reducing the fitting Sx seen in Epilepsy

# Motor Nuclei - Hypoglossal Nucleus and Dorsal Nucleus of the Vagus and Nucleus Ambiguus (CN X)

- Motor axons in cranial nerves arise from neurons in motor nuclei
- All Somatic Motor Nuclei are found near the midline of the CNS

### Hypoglossal Nucleus

- This is a section through the open medulla
- The hypoglossal (XII) nucleus is found at that level, in the mediodorsal/posteroaspect aspect (In the Medial Aspect of the Floor of the 4th Ventricle)
- The hypoglossal nerve is motor to the tongue and tested by sticking out the tongue
- The tongue points to the side of the lesion
- It is a motor nucleus where neurons have axons that project anteriorly and go out of the Medulla between the olives and pyramids (just lateral to the pyramids) and supply the muscles of the tongue

![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.17.54.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.17.54.png)

### Dorsal Nucleus of the Vagus and Nucleus Ambiguus (CN X)

**Dorsal Nucleus of the Vagus - PSNS**

- Lateral to the hypoglossal nucleus, is a parasympathetic nucleus called the dorsal nucleus of the vagus. It is the main parasympathetic nucleus
- These are preganglionic fibres which go to the GI tract, heart and respiratory tract (Thoracic and Abdo viscera). They will synapse within or close to the viscera
- It also sends branchial efferents to the larynx and pharynx.

**Nucleus Ambiguus - Motor**

- The Nucleus Ambiguus is found deep to the ventricular floor, ventral/anterior to the nucleus of the solitary tract, medial to the Spinothalamic Tracts and just dorsal to the inferior olivary nucleus (Inferior Olivary Nucleus has a wavy C shape, found in the anterior aspect of the Open Medulla, that starts and ends medially - Grey in the image below).
- It sends branchial efferents via the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves to the muscles of the larynx, pharynx and soft palate
- It supplies the fourth and sixth pharyngeal arch musculature
- It also supplies the heart via the vagus nerve
- This means it is important for speaking and swallowing
- If one is unable to swallow properly due to damage to the Nucleus Ambiguus, this may result in aspiration of food or drink, resulting in an untreatable pneumonia
- Cells in and around the nucleus ambiguus form the ventral respiratory centre

# Motor Nuclei - Abducens and Facial Motor Nuclei

### Abducens Nucleus

- This is located at the floor of the fourth ventricle at the level of the pons
- It is at the level of the inferior cerebellar peduncle, ventral to the fourth ventricle
- The abducens nerve supplies the lateral rectus (LR₆)
- This is tested by asking the Px to look to one side with both eyes and then to the other side (E.g Look Left then Right).
- Both eyes should move together and there should be no double vision
- Damage to this nucleus/Abducens Palsy will present with the ipsilateral eye being unable to move laterally/abduct
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.21.46.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.21.46.png)
    

### Facial Motor Nucleus

- The facial nerve nucleus is found in the pons, ventrolaterally to the abducens nerve nucleus and posterior to the Medial Lemniscus and Spinothalamic Tract (Between these 2 Tracts and Posterior)
- The facial nerve motor axons project posteriorly, then laterally around the abducens nucleus to project anteriorly to leave the pons
- It supplies 2nd pharyngeal arch musculature
- They supply all of the muscles of facial expression as well as stapedius (as well as other muscles)
- In order to test the facial nerve, you smile (lower part of the face) and ask them to screw up their eyes (upper part of the face)
- This will tell you when there is facial paralysis whether there is a problem with the facial nerve or the descending control from the motor cortex
- You look for symmetry, facial nerve issues will result in asymmetry
- Bell’s palsy is a facial nerve palsy of unknown origin (Idiopathic) - This is likely to be mainly due to Herpes Virus Infections due to their neurotropism
- There will be weakness on the ipsilateral side
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.23.07.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.23.07.png)
    

### Path of the Facial and Vestibulocochlear Nerve

- The Facial Nerve passes through the Internal Acoustic Meatus alongside the Vestibulocochlear Nerve
- Acoustic Neuroma/Vestibular Schwannoma = Benign Tumour growing on the Vestibular Part of the Vestibulocochlear Nerve.
- This can grow into the Posterior Cranial Fossa and compress the Facial Nerve (and parts of the Medulla and even parts of the Cerebellum) and cause a Facial Nerve Lesion
- This causes deafness in one ear (due to Vestibulocochlear Nerve Palsy) and a facial palsy on the ipsilateral side

# Motor Nuclei - Motor Nucleus of the Trigeminal Nerve and Oculomotor Nucleus

### Motor Nucleus of the Trigeminal Nerve

- This is found just medial to the chief sensory nucleus at the level of the rostral pons and leaves the brainstem via the Motor Root of the Trigeminal Nerve to be distributed through CN V3
- It supplies muscles of mastication and tensor muscles (1st pharyngeal arch musculature)
- This is tested by clenching the jaw and feeling the masseter or temporalis contracting
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.25.32.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.25.32.png)
    

### Oculomotor Nucleus

- This section goes through the superior colliculus and the midbrain
- This is found just ventral/anterior to the periaqueductal grey (PAG) in the midbrain
- PAG is associated with descending pain pathways
- The substantia nigra is grey in the diagram
- The trochlear Nucleus is in a similar position to the Oculomotor Nucleus at the level of the inferior colliculus
- It has a parasympathetic part (Edinger-Westphal nucleus) as well as somatic motor neurons
- The oculomotor nerve supplies all of the muscles in the orbit except the superior oblique and lateral rectus
- The Edinger-Westphal nucleus gives rise to preganglionic parasympathetic fibres which control pupillary constriction by innervating and controlling the constrictor pupillae
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.26.38.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.26.38.png)
    

### Trochlear Nucleus

- The Trochlear Nucleus is found just ventral/anterior to the medial aspect of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) in the midbrain
- These axons project posteriorly around the PAG and leave the Midbrain just inferior to the Inferior Colliculi (junction between Midbrain and Pons)
- These axons then decussate and run anteriorly around the contralateral side of the Midbrain to go and supply the Superior Rectus in the Contralateral Orbit
- Trochlear Nerve Palsy present with difficulty looking downwards and medially due to paralysis of Superior Oblique (Contralateral Eye tends to drift up when at Neutral Gaze)

![Screenshot 2021-11-01 at 18.14.27.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screenshot_2021-11-01_at_18.14.27.png)

# Pupillary Light Reflex and Posterior Cerebral Artery Blockage

### Pupillary Light Reflex

- All reflexes have an afferent and an efferent limb
- The afferent limb is in the optic nerve
- The efferent limb is in the oculomotor nerve
- Unlike the accommodation/convergence reflex it does not require visual cortex
- The light goes down the optic nerve which sends fibres to the pretectal nucleus - This is found at the junction of the brainstem and thalamus
- The pretectal nucleus sends fibres to both Edinger-Westphal nuclei on either side, which send fibres to the ciliary ganglia
- These send fibres to the constrictor pupilae muscles resulting in constriction of both pupils via action of the constrictor pupilae muscles
- Thus, light being shone in one eye results in constriction in both eyes (Direct and Consensual Pupillary Light Reflex in the eye in which light is being shone and the other eye respectively)
- This is checked multiple times in clinic and tests the function of:
1. Sensory Fibres within the Optic Nerve
2. Edinger-Westphal Nucleus within the Oculomotor Nucleus
3. Motor Fibres within the Oculomotor Nerve
4. Midbrain

![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.28.02.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_15.28.02.png)

### Posterior Cerebral Artery Blockage

- The posterior cerebral artery supplies the anteromedial aspects of the midbrain and runs laterally around the Upper Midbrain
- If there is damage to the part that supplies the medial aspect of the cerebral peduncle/crus cerebri, Ipsilateral Oculomotor Nerve fibres and the Corticospinal Tract here will be damaged
- This is called Weber’s syndrome
- This results in oculomotor nerve damage on the ipsilateral side
- This would present as diplopia, enlarged pupil, ptosis and the eye looking down and out
- This is because the parasympathetic supply comes via the oculomotor nerve and so the eye would be dilated
- The eye would look down and out as only the lateral rectus and superior oblique muscles are functioning as the other muscles are paralysed due to the Oculomotor Nerve Palsy
- The ptosis is due to the lack of voluntary supply to levator palpebrae superioris
- The corticospinal tract are also destroyed, resulting in contralateral hemiparesis (unilateral weakness) or hemiplegia (unilateral paralysis) - same signs as seen in UMN Lesion of Corticospinal Tract

# The Cerebellum

- This coordinates movements, mainly via the thalamus and motor areas of the cerebral cortex. It doesn't directly control motor neurones itself
- The Cerebellum is found in the Posterior Cranial Fossa, below the Occipital Lobe and the Tentorium Cerebelli
- The lateral part coordinates voluntary movements, especially those of the upper limbs
- The anterior lobe is important for walking
- The floccular-nodular lobe is important for balance and eye movement (via vestibular connections)
- There is some thought it has role in psychology
- The cerebellar cortex is grey matter which covers the Cerebellum. It is folded into folia and deep to the cortex is white matter (mainly found laterally, with very little white matter found medially)
    - The white matter of the Cerebellum looks tree-like (with the trunk being the medial linear region that connects the Brain Stem and the Cerebellum) and hence is sometimes known as The Arbor Vitae)
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_16.51.36.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_16.51.36.png)

- The cerebellar cortex is thrown into folia - This increases the surface area
- The midline part of the cerebellar cortex is called the vermis (worm) - This is not distinctly visible when viewed from above
- The anterior end of the vermis, close to the posterior wall of the 4th Ventricle, is known as the Nodule and is important in balance
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-20_at_16.30.18.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-20_at_16.30.18.png)
    
- The region of the Cerebellum just lateral to the Vermis is called the Paravermal region
- The lateral part is called the hemisphere and forms the largest part of the Cerebellum
- The cerebellar hemispheres and vermis have different functions
- The orange part at the front is called the anterior lobe, whilst the rest of it is called the posterior lobe
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_16.53.11.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_16.53.11.png)
    
- This image below shows a transverse section of the cerebellum
- The Anterior Lobe is Separated from the Posterior Lobe by the Primary Fissure, which lies in the Transverse Plane
- Folia are enormous areas of grey matter in the cerebellar cortex
- There is subcortical white matter deep to the cerebellar cortex
- Buried inside the white matter, are the small regions of grey matter that form the deep nuclei
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_16.54.02.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_16.54.02.png)
    

### Deep Nuclei of the Cerebellum

- There are lots of deep nuclei but the largest is called the dentate nucleus
- The denate nucleus is located centrally within the white matter and is C-shaped and jagged, with its start and end found medially (Similar in appearance to the Inferior Olivary Nuclei of the Medulla)
- This has a role in coordinating movements of the upper limbs on the ipsilateral side
- The deep nuclei give rise to most of the axons that leave the cerebellum (output of the Cerebellum)
- The dentate nucleus receives information from the lateral cerebellar hemispheres and projects to the contralateral motor area of the thalamus, which can then subsequently influence the motor cortex.
- The fastigial nucleus are found close to the midline and receive afferents from the vermis and projects to the vestibular nuclei (of the medulla) and reticular formation
- Many of the Axons leaving the Dentate Nuclei project anteriorly and pass through the Superior Cerebellar Peduncle to enter the Midbrain

# The Organisation of Neural Connections in the Cerebellum

- This image below shows the axons going into and out of the cerebellum
- Afferent axons going into the cerebellum give off excitatory collateral branches to the deep cerebellar nuclei
- The green axon is excitatory to the cerebellar cortex
- Purkinje cells are large cells in the cerebellar cortex that send out axons
- They are the only output from the cerebellar cortex
- Their axons are inhibitory and travel to + synapse on the deep cerebellar nuclei
- The output from the cerebellum comprises the axons of the deep cerebellar nuclei which leave the cerebellum
- There is lots of complicated circuitry in the cerebellar cortex
- Afferents to the cerebellar cortex are mainly mossy and climbing fibres
- The ideas for movement originate from the cerebral cortex (as this is where thought occurs)
- This information has to be conveyed to the cerebellum so that movement can be co-ordinated properly
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_16.57.14.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_16.57.14.png)
    
- The cerebellum also needs to receive information from the Cerebral Cortex (predominantly motor areas) on what state the body is in at a given time
- All this information goes through two types, mossy fibres and climbing fibres

**Mossy Fibres**

- Pontocerebellar fibres are a major (not sole) source of mossy fibres, which connect the Cerebral Cortex (Notably Motor Areas) and Cerebellum to allow for voluntary/conscious movements to be coordinated.
- The information goes from the cerebral cortex, to ipsilaterally to the pontine nuclei of the pons to the cerebellum
- The pontine nuclei are neurons interspersed between the bundles of corticospinal axons
- The Cerebral Cortex projects to the Ipsilateral Pontine Nuclei, which project Pontocerebellar Fibres that decussate and enter the Contralateral side of the Cerebellum via the Contralateral Middle Cerebellar Peduncle, where they form Mossy fibres in the Cerebellar Cortex
- The pontocerebellar axons decussate and then only pass through the middle cerebellar peduncle to become mossy fibres in the contralateral cerebellum, where they are now called mossy fibres
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_16.58.41.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_16.58.41.png)
    

**Climbing Fibres**

- Olives are landmarks on the anterior surface of the Medulla, found lateral to the Pyramids
- Olivocerebellar fibres form climbing fibres in the cerebellar cortex
- Climbing fibres originate only from the inferior olivary nuclei from the Medullary Olives
- Olivocerebellar fibres cross the midline, go via the inferior cerebellar peduncle into the
cerebellum and form climbing fibres in the contralateral cerebellum

# The Cerebellar Cortex

### Layers of the Cerebellar Cortex

- There are three layers in the cerebellar cortex:
- From superficial to deep:
1.  Molecular layer
2. Purkinje cells
3. Granule cell layer
- The Purkinje cells (green dots) are seen arranged in one single layer, send dendrites into the molecular layer
- The axons of the Purkinje cells pass through the Granule Cell Layer, deeply into the subcortical white matter and form the only output of the Cerebellar Cortex. These form inhibitory synapses on the deep nuclei
- Purkinje cell axons are the only axons that leave the cerebellar cortex
- The layer deep to the Purkinje cells is called the granule cell layer
- Granule cells are found here and are extremely small neurones
- There are more granule cells (Around 10¹²) than all other neurons in the brain put together
- Deep to the Granule Cell Layer is the Subcortical White Matter

### Cerebellar Cortex Connections:

### Mossy Fibres

- Mossy fibres may send excitatory collaterals that synapse on the deep cerebellar nuclei
- The Central Process of Mossy Fibres project to form excitatory synapses on Granule Cell Dendrites (Glomeruli). These Granule cells then send axons deep into the Molecular Layer of the Cerebellum, running up and down the Folia, where they form many excitatory synapses on the dendrites of Purkinje Cells
- Mossy Fibres → Granule Cell Dendrites/Glomeruli → Purkinje Cell Dendrites → Deep Cerebellar Nuclei → OUT

![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-20_at_16.59.19.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-20_at_16.59.19.png)

### Climbing Fibres

- Climbing fibres may send excitatory collaterals which synapse on the Deep Cerebellar Nuclei
- Each Purkinje Cell only has one climbing fibre, which travels up (from the cell body down the dendrites) through the Molecular Layer, forming a Large Excitatory Synapse directly on the Purkinje Fibres themselves
- The presence of these massive synapses between Climbing Fibres and Purkinje fibres means that Purkinje Cells have the largest concentration of Ca²⁺ buffering proteins of any neurones.

- Mossy and Climbing Fibres are likely to be carrying error signals
- These are signals that movement is going wrong and needs to be corrected

### Sensory Input into the Cerebellum

- It must receive sensory information in order to establish the state/position the body is in at a given time in order to coordinate movement properly
- The sensory information from the spinal cord comes from the spinocerebellar tract
- There are dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tracts
- The dorsal spinocerebellar tract is regarded as being more important
- Proprioceptive Afferents enter the Spinal Cord, travel up the Dorsal Columns and enter the Grey Matter, where it synapses in Clarke's Column/Thoracic Nucleus
- It comes from thoracic spinal cord
- Clarke’s column is a column of neurons found in the medial side of the deep dorsal horn in C8 – L2
- The Axons of Clarke's Column project Laterally to enter the Dorsal Spinocerebellar Tract, found at the Lateral Edge of the Spinal Cord
- The axons go up the Ipsilateral Spinocerebellar Tract and through the inferior cerebellar peduncle into the cerebellum

# Cerebellar Lesions and Agenesis

**Hemisphere Lobe Lesion Signs - All Ipsilateral:**

1. Intention tremor
o Lesions effect limbs ipsilaterally
o Intention tremor would manifest when the limb goes in the wrong direction, it would be
corrected under visual guidance (as the Cerebellum is unable to correct an errors in the movement that originates within the Cerebral Cortex) and the movement would be jerky and unsteady
o This is distinct to a resting tremor (Parkinson’s)
o An intention tremor manifests when one is trying to carry out an action (Voluntary Movement)
2. Dysdiadochokinesia:
o This is the inability to do rapidly alternating movements (e.g. rapid pronation and supination)
o Again, the effect is ipsilateral
3. Speech problems

![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-20_at_17.18.31.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-20_at_17.18.31.png)

**Anterior Lobe Lesion Signs:**

1.  Gait ataxia:
o Uncoordinated/staggering gait
o It is common in alcoholics as the anterior lobe is affected first
o Walking is not organised in the anterior lobe, but it is coordinated there

### Mechanism behind the Ipsilateral Effects of Cerebellar Lesions

1. Purkinjie cell axons from the cerebellar hemisphere synapse on the Dentate Nucleus
2. A neuron in the dentate nucleus sends out an axon which leaves the Cerebellum via the Superior Cerebellar Peduncle, crosses the midline/decussate to synapse on the contralateral thalamus, which in turn sends axons which synapse on the motor cortex on that side
3. The corticospinal axons from the cerebral cortex descend and decussate again on their way down to the muscles
- This means the pathway from the cerebellar cortex to motor neurons for the limbs involves a double cross (Axon from Dentate Nucleus and Corticospinal Axon both decussate) and thus the effects of lesions are ipsilateral
- One cerebellar hemisphere coordinates movement on the ipsilateral part of the body
- The lateral cerebellum influences movements via the thalamus, motor cortex and corticospinal tract

![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_17.07.07.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_17.07.07.png)

### Cerebellar Agenesis

- People can fail to develop a fully-grown cerebellum, and there is always a much smaller cerebellum hidden in the brainstem (often only on one side) - This is not fatal
- They will also likely have a small pons as the small cerebellum means there is little input into the cerebellum from the Pons
- The cerebellum should be around the size of a fist
- The patients are always clumsy and have some cognitive issues

# Floccular-Nodular Lobe

- The flocculus (region of the cerebellum found slightly inferoposterior to the Middle Cerebelalr Peduncle - Labelled F on the Brainstem Image) is connected to the anterior part of the vermis called the nodule (Found inferior to where the cerebellum is connected to the Brainstem via Peduncles)
- Together they comprise the floccular-nodular lobe which is important for balance and eye movement amongst other things (Vestibular Functions).

![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screenshot_2021-07-21_at_13.55.30.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screenshot_2021-07-21_at_13.55.30.png)

- This is the only aspect of the cerebellum that fish have (They lack limbs so they do not need Cerebellar Hemispheres to coordinate movement) and hence, it is the oldest part of the cerebellum in evolutionary terms
- Fish only need to stay upright
- This region influences motor function via the fastigial nucleus and hence to the vestibulospinal and reticulospinal tracts and medial longitudinal fasciculus. This is in contrast to the Hemispheres which influence motor function via connections with the Cerebral Hemisphere

![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_17.12.44.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_17.12.44.png)

- Problems with the floccular-nodular lobe (E.g Lesions) result in truncal ataxia (difficulty sitting upright), nystagmus (abnormal eye movements) and other eye movement problems
    - The Floccular-Nodular Lobe can be damaged and its function impaired by Medulloblastomas that grow anteriorly towards the Cerebellum
    
    ![%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_17.10.55.png](%5B028%5D%20Brainstem%20II%2015e86f8d4065468d83332b077f3d09f9/Screen_Shot_2021-07-15_at_17.10.55.png)
    
- The fastigial nucleus in the cerebellum (one of the deep nuclei) receives information from the floccular-nodular lobe and sends axons to the vestibular nuclei and reticular formation (Floccular-Nodular Lobe → Fastigial Nucleus → Vestibular Nuclei and Reticular Formation)
- The medial longitudinal fascicles are a group of axons in the medial floor of the 4th Ventricle (Posterior to the Medial Lemnisci)/Posterior Wall of the Brainstem.
- These axons are found all along the brainstem and connect the nuclei of CN III, IV, VI and VII (Responsible for Eye Movements) in order to co-ordinate vestibulo-ocular reflexes

# Vestibulospinal Tracts

- The lateral vestibular nuclei give rise to the vestibulospinal tracts
- It is a descending tract that comes from the lateral vestibular nucleus and is found in the most ventral/anterior aspect of the white matter (Slightly Anterolateral to the Ventral Horn)
- They are involved in coordinating keeping one upright
- The lateral vestibular nucleus receives a lot of information from the vestibular apparatus which monitors the position of the head and the floccular-nodular lobe
- The information concerns linear and angular acceleration relating to the head
- The vestibular nerves end in the vestibular nuclei
- Axons travel down ipsilaterally from the lateral vestibular nucleus and synapses on interneurons in the spinal cord
- These interneurons innervate/synapse on motor neurons, which normally innervate erector spinae muscles
- Postural muscles (e.g. erector spinae) need to be contracting all the time in order to maintain posture
- The Vestibulospinal Tracts are not involved in voluntary movement, it coordinates posture without thinking about it and keeps you upright
- They are normally subject to descending inhibitory influences to prevent tonic contraction of extensor muscles to allow for movements at joints whilst maintaining posture. Decerebrate rigidity is produced if this inhibition is lost
- If someone gets a lesion in their brainstem above the level of the vestibular nuclei the descending inhibition is lost, and the patient becomes rigid (Decerebrate Rigidity) as the extensor muscles are constantly contracting.

# The Reticular Formation and Reticulospinal Tracts

- The reticular formation is a complicated network of nuclei in the brainstem that give rise to reticulospinal tracts which are important motor pathways, which can be influenced by axons from the Cerebral Cortex which synapse upon the Reticular Formation
- The brainstem reticular formation receives information from the cerebral cortex
- It receives sensory information, particularly nociception (as the spinothalamic tracts give many collaterals to the reticular formation) and this forms the reticular activating system which keeps one alert and conscious
- Some nuclei form respiratory centres
- Monoaminergic nuclei project all over the CNS, modulating synaptic activity

# Important Points From The First 3 Lectures

What tract carries nociceptive information to the forebrain?

- Spinothalamic tract

What tract carries discriminative touch information to the forebrain?

- Dorsal column/medial lemniscus system

What is the lowest number of neurons on any somatosensory pathway to the cerebral cortex?

- 3

Where do all somatosensory pathways synapse?

- Thalamus

What is the main pathway controlling voluntary motor activities?

- Corticospinal tract
- The big difference in motor function between experimental quadrupeds and primates is that primates depend on their cerebral cortex for most of their motor activity
- The cerebral cortex can influence motor activity via the corticospinal tracts (which is mostly used for voluntary movements)
- There are other descending pathways from the cerebral cortex that can control voluntary motor activity except for the fine movements of the hands which can only be done via the corticospinal tract
- Quadrupeds can walk around without their cerebral cortex, primates cannot

If you cut the right side of the cervical spinal cord, which lower limb is paralysed and what are the effects on nociception and discriminative touch sensation in the lower limbs?

- Ipsilateral side would be affected as tracts have already decussated before they reach the lesion
