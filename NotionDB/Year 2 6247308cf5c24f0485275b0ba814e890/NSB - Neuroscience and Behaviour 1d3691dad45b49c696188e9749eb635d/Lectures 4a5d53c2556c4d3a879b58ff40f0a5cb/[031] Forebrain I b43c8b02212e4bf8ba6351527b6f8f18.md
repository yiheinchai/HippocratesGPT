# Functional Localisation within the Cerebral Cortex

### Functional Localisation

- This is clinically important
- When an individual has had a stroke, the blood supply to an aspect of their cerebral cortex may be impaired, resulting in specific symptoms due to the location of damage

### Cerebral Cortex

- "The names and other details of this do not need to be learnt, it is for context”
- Nearly all of the cerebral cortex is called neocortex (as it is newer evolutionarily as it has developed in mammals)
- The olfactory and limb areas are allocortex
- The neocortex has VI layers of grey matter, I superficially and VI as the deepest layer.
- The thickness of each layer of the neocortex varies in different regions for the cerebral cortex

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.31.13.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.31.13.png)

- The corticospinal tracts arise from layer V
- Pyramidal neurons in layer V give rise to corticospinal tract axons
- Pyramidal Neurons have an apical dendrite that projects superficially and an axon that projects deep into the Subcortical White Matter
- Association, commissural and projection fibres come from pyramidal neurons and are the axons that leave the cerebral cortex
- Association Fibres leave the Cerebral Cortex and go to Cortical Regions in the Ipsilateral Hemisphere
- Commissural Fibres leave the Cerebral Cortex and decussate to go to the Cortical Regions in the Contralateral Hemisphere
- Projection Fibres leave the Cerebral Cortex and go to Non-Cortical Regions deep in the Forebrain or down the Spinal Cord (E.g Corticospinal Axons)
- Layer IV is where the thalamocortical fibres end, conveying information from the Thalamus
- This region is rather thick in regions receiving lots of somatosensory information
- These conveys all the information from the thalamus

# Lobes of the Cerebral Hemisphere

- The Cerebral Cortex is organised into folds called gyri and grooves called sulci - This is done to increase the surface area of the cortex to allow for more complex processes to be computed/performed by the brain

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.33.13.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.33.13.png)

- The cerebral cortex is divided into several lobes, which are named after the bones of the skull to which they are associated with
- The lateral/Sylvian fissure is very deep and separates the temporal lobe (below) and frontal lobe (in front) on the lateral surface of the cortex - It originates anteroinferiorly and ends midway along the cortex
- The central sulcus of Rolando divides the frontal (in front) and parietal (behind) lobes
- It is easily identified as it travels all the way round the lateral surface of the hemisphere but does not reach the lateral fissure
- It is the only sulcus that has a gyrus in front of and behind it.
- It has a gyrus inferiorly which separates it from the Lateral/Sylvian Fissure
- The occipital lobe is at the back
- There are no clear landmarks on the lateral surface of the hemispheres for separating the occipital lobe from the parietal and temporal lobes

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.32.45.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.32.45.png)

- The lateral ventricles, which are inside each cerebral hemisphere extends into each lobe of the cerebral hemisphere and follow the same shape as the hemispheres
- The anterior horn of the lateral ventricle is found in the frontal lobe and is connected to the third ventricle
- The posterior horn extends into the occipital lobe
- The inferior/temporal horn extends into the temporal lobe

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.36.09.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.36.09.png)

- The grey matter is cerebral cortex which covers gyri superficially
- The Corpus Callosum/Great Commissure is found running along the superior border of the Lateral Ventricles
- The cortex comes round and lifts up an aspect of the lateral fissure, goes inwards and is continuous with the insular cortex, buried beneath the lateral fissure
- This, in turn, is continuous with the cortex that goes out from the lateral fissure and over temporal lobe
- The thalamus can be seen on each side of the third ventricle

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.44.29.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.44.29.png)

- The insular cortex (Island of Reil) is buried inside the lateral fissure, along its floor
- There are gyrae on the surface of the insular cortex which have multiple complex functions (E.g Somatosensory Region that is important in nociception)
- It is rarely investigated by Clinicians as the Middle Cerebral Artery runs closely associated with the length of the Insular Cortex which can be damaged during procedures of the Insular Cortex
- The Opercular Parts of the Temporal, Parietal and Frontal Lobes are those lobe regions that cover the Insular Cortex

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.45.18.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.45.18.png)

# Sulci and Gyri

### Parieto-Occipital Sulcus

- On the medial surface of the hemisphere, there is a deep parietooccipital sulcus which separates the parietal (in front) and occipital (behind) lobes (It can be seen originating from half-way along the Cerebellum and running superiorly)
- There is no such landmark on the lateral sulcus

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.46.59.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.46.59.png)

### Frontal Lobe Gyri

- Directly, in front of the central sulcus is the precentral gyrus
- There are two sulci running laterally across the lateral surface of the frontal lobe:
• Superior frontal sulcus
• Inferior frontal sulcus
- They separate out three frontal gyri:
• Superior frontal gyrus (Found Along the Superior Margin of the Lateral Surface of the Frontal Lobe)
• Middle frontal gyrus (Runs Superoposteriorly and is usually continuous with inferior part of the precentral gyrus posteriorly in life)
• Inferior frontal gyrus (It runs along the inferior border of the Frontal Lobe on its lateral surface, just superior to the Lateral/Sylvian Sulcus)

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.49.46.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.49.46.png)

### Temporal Lobe Gyri

- In the temporal lobe, the lateral lobe is demarcated by the superior and inferior temporal sulci
- These separate the:
    1. Superior Temporal Gyrus - Runs along the superior margin of the Temporal Lobe on its lateral surface, just Inferior to the Lateral/Sylvian Sulcus
    2. Middle Temporal Gyrus - Runs between the Superior and Inferior Gyrus
    3. Inferior Temporal Gyrus - Runs along the inferior margin of the Temporal Lobe on its Lateral Surface
    
    ![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.52.22.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.52.22.png)
    

### Parietal Lobe Gyri

- Directly Behind the central sulcus is the postcentral gyrus
- There are two more difficult gyri:
1.  The Supramarginal gyrus is just posterosuperior to the lateral fissure, found at the Posterior blunt-end of the Lateral Fissure
2. The Angular gyrus is posterosuperior to and at the posterior blunt-end of the superior temporal sulcus. It has roles in reading and writing
- The Intraparietal Sulcus divides the Parietal Lobe into an Inferior and Superior Parietal Lobule

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.54.09.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.54.09.png)

- The region of grey matter where the motor and somatosensory cortices for the lower limbs meet on the medial surface of the hemisphere is called the paracentral lobule. This is found on either side of/lateral to the Central Sulcus
    - The Fusiform Gyrus is found lateral to the Parahippocampus Gyrus and is visible on the Inferior Surface of the Temporal Lobe and is important in recognition
    
    ![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.54.56.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.54.56.png)

# Functional Localisation and Brodmann's Areas

- Brodmann areas divide the cerebral cortex up into different areas which are numbered based upon histology
- These reflect the different functions of the regions to an extent
- “The numbered areas do not need to be remembered beyond the relevant ones”
- They reflect the fact that the structure of the cerebral cortex is different in different areas due to different functions
- Functional localisation can be done by observing patients with lesions, which can convey a significant amount of information

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.57.11.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_19.57.11.png)

# Broca's Area

- Paul Broca was a French doctor who had a patient who could only say one word
- He could understand speech but not produce speech (expressive aphasia)
- After his death, the lesion was localised to Brodmann areas 44 and 45 (Broca’s area)
- Broca's Area (Brodmann Areas 44 and 45) is demarcated by 2 small sulci that extend into the Temporal Lobe from the Anterior end of the Lateral Sulcus
- It is found in the lower part of the frontal lobe, above the lateral fissure and ventral/anterior to the premotor area
- It is an important motor speech area (AKA involved in production of fluent speech vs comprehension) that is only found in the dominant hemisphere (typically left, even in left-handed people)
- It helps to define the dominant hemisphere (Dominant Hemisphere is functionally more significant in speech production than the Non-Dominant Hemisphere)
- The equivalent of Broca’s area in the non-dominant hemisphere is responsible for synchronised speech and is thus important for singing/musicality
- In young children who have lesions in Broca's Area, the corresponding site in the non-dominant hemisphere can take over the function of Broca's Area to maintain speech motor ability - This becomes more difficult to achieve as an individual ages and rarely can occur in adults
- Some people who have a lesion in Broca’s area can sing things that they cannot speak

# Motor Functions

- Motor function has been studied extensively by electrical stimulation and functional MRI
- Electrical stimulation is possible on conscious patients as there is no nociception in the brain
- This means neurosurgery can be done under local anaesthetic in certain circumstance to get into the brain,  and then the patient can stay conscious so that neurosurgeons can test that they are not damaging language areas of the brain
- Motor Areas have been differentiated and identified via electrical stimulation of conscious individuals, with electrical stimulation in different areas producing different effects
- The precentral gyrus (red on the left) was the place that could be stimulated with the lowest intensity to produce a contralateral movement - This is the Primary Motor Cortex.
    
    ![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.01.17.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.01.17.png)

# Motor Regions

### Primary Motor Cortex

- The area below the precentral gyrus is called the primary motor area or M1
- This is Brodmann area 4
- This area can produce the movement with the least amount of electrical stimulation
- The Primary Motor Cortex contains most of the cell bodies of Corticospinal Neurons
- The motor cortex extends to the medial surface of the hemisphere
- Different regions of the Primary Motor Cortex correspond to specific regions of the body and hence, there is Somatotropic Organisation
- Inferiorly within the PMC, Larynx Motor Neurones are found and moving superiorly, there is Tongue, Face (Large Area), Upper Limb (Large Area - Notably for the hand) and on the superior region of the PMC on the lateral surface is the perineum.
- On the medial surface of the PMC, the lower limb area is found

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-21_at_15.26.35.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-21_at_15.26.35.png)

- In front of it, there is a poorly defined triangular area (orange on the left, with the base located on the medial surface and its apex on the lateral surface of the hemisphere) called the premotor area

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.02.39.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.02.39.png)

### Premotor Area

- If this is stimulated, it will produce a movement on the contralateral, but a more intense stimulus is required (The movements produced will also be more complex than those produced by PMC stimulation)
- This is Brodmann area 6
- The lateral part of the premotor area is formed by the premotor cortex whilst the part of the premotor area on the medial surface of the hemisphere is called the supplementary motor area.
- On the medial surface of the hemisphere, continuous with the premotor area on the lateral hemisphere is the supplementary motor area
- The Supplementary motor area is distinct from the PMA and M1 and some corticospinal neurones arise here but it is mainly involved in planning movements
- This is active bilaterally when planning movement
- It can also be stimulated to produce movement
- Actual movement is contralateral, but planning movement is bilateral
- Both the PMA, SMA and M1 are found on the Precentral Gyrus
- Mirror Neurons were first identified in the inferior region of the Premotor Area on the Lateral Hemisphere, which are active during Movement but also when seeing another individual carrying out the same movement

# Frontal Eye Field and Somatosensory Cortex

### Frontal Eye Field

- Just in front of the premotor cortex/area, on the posterior end of the middle frontal gyrus is the frontal eye field
- It is found in both hemispheres
- It controls eye movements and ensures conjugate movement of the eyes (allows eyes to move together)
- If you stimulate the frontal eye field, both eyes look towards the contralateral side
- If there is a lesion in the frontal eye field, both eyes look towards the side of the lesion
- It is the highest control for movements of the eye

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.10.05.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.10.05.png)

### Somatosensory Cortex

- The Somatosensory Cortex is found in the Postcentral Gyrus of the Parietal Lobe, Posterior to the Central Sulcus
- This is the cortex where somatosensory information arrives first
- It is then analysed with other parts of cerebral cortex
- This consists of Brodmann areas 3, 1 and 2
- The somatosensory cortex (Postcentral Gyrus) and M1 (Precentral Gyrus) can be distinguished histologically as the Precentral Gyrus has large Pyramidal Neurones in Layer V of its Neocortex called Betz Cells
- They are only found in the Layer V of the Neocortex of the precentral gyrus and give rise to the largest diameter corticospinal neurons (Fast Conduction Velocity) which are important for control of the hands and fingers

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.11.04.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.11.04.png)

### Somatotopic Organisation of M1 and S1

- There is a body map in both the motor and somatosensory cortices (they both have the same somatotopic organisation)
- From medial to lateral, it goes from the lower limb, perineum and genitalia, a big area for the hands, a big area for face, tongue, mouth, pharynx and larynx (near the lateral fissure)
- A bulge backwards/posteriorly can be seen in the hand areas (hand knob)
- The hand part of cerebral cortex is so large as we are able to carry out many delicate movements with the hands as well as have excellent ability of sensation from the hands
- The organisation of the motor cortex is more complex than this, it is not the case that each corticospinal neuron controls one muscle, they have widespread terminals, synapsing on many different muscles in different regions

# Visual Areas

- At the back of the brain there is a horizontal fissure on the medial surface called the Calcarine sulcus, which runs anteriorly between the Parieto-Occipital Sulcus and the Occipital Pole
- Visual information mainly arrives at the calcarine sulcus and V1 here first
- Primary visual cortex = V1 = Brodmann area 17. V1 = The region of the Cerebral Cortex found just surrounding and within the Calcarine Sulcus, extending to the Occipital Pole posteriorly
- The region of Visual Association Cortex found surrounding V1 is Brodmann's Area 18 and is called V2 = Secondary Visual Cortex
- There is a Retinotopic Map along V1, with the posterior part of V1 near the Occipital Pole is for Macular/Central Vision (Where most cones are found within Retina, producing the sharpest, colour vision). the Anterior part of V1 is for the peripheral field of vision (Where most of the rods are found in the retina, responsible for black and white vision, which is the most sensitive region of vision)
- Due to the Posterior Region of V1 being responsible for Coloured, Macular Vision, If an individual is struck at the back of their head, they may temporarily lose coloured vision
- Each area of V1 receives visual information from the contralateral visual field of both eyes
- The right primary visual cortex will receive the left visual field of both eyes and vice versa
- Both eyes have left and right visual fields
- A lesion in the right primary visual cortex would result in a loss of vision in the left visual fields of both eyes (E.g a lesion in V1 on one side causes a loss of vision in the contralateral visual field of both eyes)
- A lesion in both primary visual cortices results in cortical blindness (blindsight)
- This is when the eyes work and optic nerves work, but they would not be able to consciously see things
- These patients can often guess what is in their visual field (more than would be predicted by chance) even though they cannot see anything
- Some patients will be able to detect moving objects in their visual field as there is another visual pathway to the Cerebral Cortex that arrives at a different aspect of visual cortex (Not V1) which is important in conveying information about moving objects
    
    ![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.14.57.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.14.57.png)
    
- From V1, visual information is sent to V2 and then to other visual association areas (Visual Association Areas are found along the Superior and Inferior Border of the brain as 2 streams, extending anteriorly from the Occipital Pole)
- There is said to be two streams of information which go from V1 to be interpreted
- These fields were discovered by the Sx of Pxs with Focal Epilepsy in the Visual Association Area stream extending into the Temporal Lobe and Parietal Lobe
- Information that is sent superiorly towards the parietal lobe is the “where” stream
- This relates to where in the visual field an object is
- This is related to area 7 of Brodmann in the posterior region of the Parietal Lobe (in the Superior Parietal Lobule) - It is also important for visually guided movements (E.g Throwing a ball at a target)
- Information that is sent anteriorly to the temporal lobe is the “what” stream
- This relates to the identity of an object in the visual field
- These 2 streams of information are then combined to create a cohesive and conscious visual image

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.16.54.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_20.16.54.png)

- At the junction between the Occipital Lobe and the Temporal Lobe, there is a ridge called the Extrastriate Body Area, which is used to identify body parts
- In the Dominant/Left Hemisphere, just anterior to the Fusiform Face Area is the Fusiform Word Area, which allows individuals to identify words by their shapes

---

# Fusiform Gyrus

- The parahippocampal gyrus is medial to the fusiform gyrus on the inferior surface of the brain

![Screenshot 2021-11-02 at 09.57.22.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-11-02_at_09.57.22.png)

- In the fusiform gyrus, the fusiform face area is found

- This is the area necessary to allow the identification of people by their faces
- This is an extension of the “what stream” from V1 into the Temporal Lobe
- There are areas for identifying different classes of objects and the fusiform face area analyses face

- This is an fMRI showing where there is activity in the fusiform face area
- It is active bilaterally, but it is typically lesions in the right fusiform face area that cause prosopagnosia (instead of the left)
- Prosopagnosia = loss of the ability to identify people by their faces
- This suggests that the right fusiform face area is more important
- In the left area, close to the fusiform face area, there is a fusiform word recognition area
- This is unsurprising as the left hemisphere often relates to language processing

- Just posterior to the Fusiform Face Area is the Fusiform Body Area, which allows individuals to identify others by their bodies

# Parahippocampal Gyrus

- Near the back end of the corpus callosum in the Posterior aspect of the Parahippocampal Gyrus is the parahippocampal place area
- It contains a region necessary for identifying places
- It is active bilaterally

# Primary Auditory Cortex and Wernicke's Area

- On the superior surface of the lateral temporal lobe (mainly hidden within the Lateral/Sylvian Fissure), there is a transverse temporal gyrus
- This is where the primary auditory cortex, which is the area that first receives auditory information in the cerebral cortex is found
- It is present in both hemispheres, both ears project to both primary auditory cortices
- Hearing is still present if one auditory cortex is lost as the other auditory information is still receiving information from both ears
- Around the primary auditory cortex, Wernicke’s area is found - This is the cortex that surrounds the posterior end of the Lateral/Sylvian Sulcus (It starts just anterior to the Primary Auditory Cortex in the Temporal Lobe and extends into the Inferior region of the Parietal Lobe)
- This consists of Brodmann areas 22, 39 and 40 but is rather poorly defined
- It is an important sensory language area (Interpreting and Forming Language)
- The lateral surface of the temporal lobe is an important language area
- The function of the temporal lobe aspect (22), proximal to the Primary Auditory Cortex, is understanding and producing speech
- Further away from the temporal lobe (22), in the lower part of the parietal lobe (39 and 40), its function is in understanding other aspects of language, like writing or sign language
- This is only found in the dominant hemisphere (normally left)
- The angular gyrus is particularly important for reading and writing
- Alexia is an inability/difficulty to read
- Agraphia is an inability/difficulty to write

**Broca’s versus Wernicke’s Lesion:**

- A lesion in Broca’s area will result in difficulty producing fluent speech
- A lesion in Wernicke’s area will result in difficulty formulating and understanding any form of language

# Parietal Lobe Functions

- Behind the Hand Knob/Area of S1, within the Postcentral Sulcus, is a region important for stereognosis:
- This interprets sensory information (such as texture and weight, notably Discriminative Touch from the DC/ML Pathway) of an unseen object which is being held, thus working out what an object is
- This function is present in both hemispheres (but for different hands)
- The intraparietal sulcus is a sulcus that runs straight backwards down the parietal lobe
- The cortex in the intraparietal sulcus, found just posterior to the hand area of the somatosensory cortex and medial to the intraparietal sulcus, seems to be important for aspects of arithmetic
- Here, number specific neurons are present, with specific neurons becomin activated when a certain number of objects are in the visual field
- This is the case for both parietal lobes, but it is perhaps more important in the left parietal lobe

**Constructional ability is a function of the Right Parietal Lobe:**

- This is the ability to build something from composite parts
- It is usually tested by giving someone a very simple jigsaw (e.g. three-piece)
- A lesion in the right parietal lobe would prevent someone from doing this properly
- They may be normal in all other aspects

**Body Image - Function of Left and Right Parietal Lobe:**

- We all have an image of our own body and the size/structure of it, both in itself but also relative to other structures
- This translates to the size of a car
- If there is an open door or entrance, we can assess whether we will fit through or not
- Strokes in the right parietal lobe, they will often be unable to recognise their left side of the body as their own, there is a loss of body image on the contralateral side
- It is much less common to get loss of body image on the right-hand side (E.g Lesions in Right Parietal are more common than those in Left Parietal - This is likely due to the fact that Left Parietal Stroke would also impact communication of language and hence, communication over loss of right-sided body image)
- Hemineglect is commonly seen following Parietal Lobe Lesions, where Individuals often ignore the details of the contralateral side of an image due to an unawareness/unresponsiveness of features on the contralateral side

**Mirror Neurones**

- The Inferior Region of the Intraparietal Sulcus and Premotor Cortex of the Temporal Lobe contain Mirror Neurones
- These are active when you produce a movement and when you watch someone else produce a movement

# Prefrontal Cortex

- The prefrontal cortex is the cortex in the frontal lobe which is in front of the motor area, premotor cortex and Broca’s area
- It has functions in personality, planning for the future and relationships with people

![%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_21.32.02.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-07-15_at_21.32.02.png)

**Phineas Gage:**

- He was a railway worker in Victorian times
- He served as the basis of analysing prefrontal cortex function as a 3-foot metal rod went into the right side of his face through his orbit and out through the left side of his skull, demolishing his prefrontal cortex bilaterally
- He survived and had preserved all motor function and seemed normal other than his personality changing drastically to the point that he never worked again and lost concern for his family
- This showed prefrontal cortex to be involved in relationship planning and planning for the future

**Prefrontal Lobotomy:**

- In the 1930s, Antonia Egas Moniz invented prefrontal leucotomy/lobotomy which involved cutting off the prefrontal cortex
- If the only the connections between 2 regions are cut = leucotomy
- If it is all cut = lobotomy
- The effects of both are the same
- He won the Nobel Prize for developing this procedure
- He also developed cerebral angiography
- 40-50,000 people were lobotomised in the US
- It was carried out as a mass procedure where a small amount of local anaesthetic was placed on the upper part of the orbit and then a device could be pushed through the roof of the orbit into the frontal lobe
- 17,000 people in the UK were lobotomized
- It eliminates an individual’s intellect and personality despite being used for mental health conditions

# Orbital Gyri

- The prefrontal cortex extends on to gyri on the inferior surface of the frontal lobe, lateral to the Gyrus Rectus (found just lateral to the Longitudinal Fissure), to form the orbital/orbitofrontal gyri
- This is comprised of the Medial Orbital Gyrus, Anterior Orbital Gyrus, Posterior Orbital Gyrus and a Lateral Orbital Gyrus, demarcated by an H Shaped Occipital Sulcus
- They are also part of the prefrontal cortex and have a role in decision making, assessing risk and reward and the integration of olfaction and taste with other sensory experiences so that flavours can be appreciated (notably the Posterior Orbital Gyrus)

# Limbic Cortex

- The corpus callosum is the great commissure that connects the two hemispheres together
- Cutting the Corpus Callosum has very little effect on the Px  but is done in Interactive Epilepsy to stop seizures spreading from one hemisphere to the other
- The main Sx are seen when the Px is trying to integrate functions of each cortex E.g Showing Px something in Left Visual Field goes to the Right Hemisphere, which cannot communicate with the Left Hemisphere where speech is produced, preventing the Px from being able to tell you what is in their left visual field)
- If Person is born with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum, it often has more severe effects (E.g Cognitive Abnormalities) than those present when the Corpus Callosum is cut in adults
- The Lamina Terminalis forms the Anterior Wall of the Third Ventricle and attached to its posterior surface is the Anterior Commissure, which connects aspects of the Temporal Lobes and contains fibres involved in Olfactory Processes
- In the Lower Part of the Stalk of the Pineal Gland (Attached to the Posterior Wall of the 3rd Ventricle) is the Posterior Commissure, which connects structures within the Midbrain (E.g Decussating Neurons involved in the Pupillary Eye Reflex)

![Screenshot 2021-11-02 at 10.24.16.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-11-02_at_10.24.16.png)

- Around the corpus callosum is an important gyrus called the cingulate gyrus, which runs along the superior border of the Corpus Callosum
- The Subcallosal Gyrus/Cortex/Area of the Cingulate Gyrus is very active in individuals with Severe Depression
- The experience/Sx of Major Depression can be reduced by Deep Brain Stimulation of the Subcallosal Gyrus
- The Retrosplenial Cortex is the region of the Cingulate Gyrus found posterior to the Splenium of the Corpus Callosum and is important in memory (alongside the anterior aspect of the Parahippocampal Gyrus)
- Olfactory Cortex is also called the Piriform Cortex

![Screenshot 2021-11-02 at 10.31.30.png](%5B031%5D%20Forebrain%20I%20b43c8b02212e4bf8ba6351527b6f8f18/Screenshot_2021-11-02_at_10.31.30.png)

- The cingulate gyrus is connected posteroinferiorly via the narrow isthmus to the parahippocampal gyrus (Here, the Cingulate Gyrus is continuous with the Parahippocampal Gyrus)
- The Parahippocampal Gyrus runs anteroinferorly alongside the Hippocampus and inferior to the Corpus Callosum and Midbrain
- At the anterior end of the parahippocampal gyrus, there is a fold/bump as the gyrus bends to change direction from running anteroinferior to posterosuperior. This is called the uncus
- The uncus makes up the primary olfactory cortex
- The cingulate gyrus has multiple functions:
1. The Anterior Cingulate Gyrus is involved in ANS Control
2. Higher centre of micturition in the anterior cingulate gyrus
o This determines the appropriate area and time to pass urine
o Lesions bilaterally prevent this area from working properly
3. Area for nociception
