# [015] The Nose and Paranasal Air Sinuses

# Bony Elements of the Nasal Cavity

- Most bones of the visceral skull participate in the formation of the nasal cavity
- These include ****the:
1. Ethmoid bone which forms the posterior aspect of the Roof and the Posterior Wall
2. Frontal bone provides some shape of the nose
3. Nasal bones - These are found anterior to the Maxilla and form the Bridge of the nose
4. Sphenoid - This forms the Posterior aspect of the Roof
5. Maxilla forms the lateral walls and floor of the nose anteriorly (posterior aspect of the lateral wall and floor is formed by the Palatine Bone - Here, the Palatine Bone forms the Hard Palate)
6. Inferior nasal concha
7. Vomer is found at the back of the midline of the nose - It is a bony element of the nasal septum
- The Anterior Aspect of the Nose that protrudes anterior to the Face is mainly cartiaginous
- The Anterior Opening to the Nasal Cavity is called the Naris/Nares and the Posterior Opening of the Nasal Cavity into the Nasopharynx is called the Choana(e)

# Ethmoid

- This forms the roof of the nasal cavity
- It conveys the olfactory neurons from the Olfactory Bulb (I) via the Cribiform Plate
- The Cribriform Plate forms the roof of the nose and the floor of the Anterior Cranial Fossa
- The Crista Galli is extended inferiorly as the Perpendicular Plate of the Ethmoid and forms superoposterior part of the midline nasal septum
- On the side of this Perpendicular Plate, inferior to the Cribriform Plate, there are numerous air cells, lined with Respiratory Epithelium, whose lateral walls lie in the medial walls of the orbital cavity
- These air cells are expanded in the superior region of the Nasal Cavity to form the Anterior, Middle and Posterior Groups of Air Cells/Sinuses
- This makes the Ethmoid very thin and hence, highly fragile
- On the Medial Walls of the Ethmoid, there are bony processes
- There are three conchae in the nose:
1. The middle and superior nasal conchae are formed by the ethmoid
- You can usually only see the Crista Galli of the Ethmoid as the rest is embedded between other bones

# Sphenoid

- This forms the roof of the nasal cavity
- The Body of the Sphenoid contains the Sphenoidal Air Sinus just posterior to the Nasal Cavity
- It is connected to the vomer to form the bony posterior nasal septum
- It contains the pterygoid canal which conveys blood vessels into the nose
- Its inferior surface is irregular and extends down as Medial and Lateral Pterygoid Plates on each side, which extend down to the level of the palate, on either side of it
- At its inferior tip of the Medial Pterygoid Plate, the Pterygoid Hamulus is found and this is where the tendon of Tensor Veli Palatini passes around to run into the soft palate
- The Sphenoid Posteriorly and the Maxilla anteriorly do not completely meet, forming the Pterygomaxillary Fissure between these bones
- Deep within this fissure lies part of the Palatine Bone, found wedged between Sphenoid and the Maxilla, opposite the Pterygoid Plates
- The Palatine is L Shaped when viewed anteriorly as the vertical aspect of the bone bifurcates
- The Sphenopalatine Foramen passes through the Bifurcation of the Palatine.

![Scannable Document 2 on 11 Nov 2021 at 3_25_47 pm.png](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/Scannable_Document_2_on_11_Nov_2021_at_3_25_47_pm.png)

- This deepest/most superior region of this fissure bounded by the Palatine Bone superiorly, Maxilla anteriorly and Sphenoid Posteriorly forms the Pterygopalatine Fossa
- From within the Skull, the Foramen Rotundum and the Pterygoid Canal (smaller) of the Sphenoid connect the Middle Cranial Fossa posteriorly and the Pterygopalatine Fossa anteriorly via the Sphenoid Bone

![Scannable Document 3 on 11 Nov 2021 at 4_09_27 pm.png](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/Scannable_Document_3_on_11_Nov_2021_at_4_09_27_pm.png)

- The Foramen Rotundum is found superior to the Pterygoid Canal
- The Infraorbital Fissure and Canal continue anteriorly to the Infraorbital Foramen on the Anterior Aspect of the Maxilla
- The Sphenopalatine Foramen is found deep within the Pterygomaxillary Fissure and connects the Pterygopalatine Fissure to the Lateral Wall and Roof of the Nose.
- It is formed from part of the Sphenoid and Palatine Bone
- The Palatine Canal runs from the Pterygopalatine Fossa down the side of the palate, piercing Bony palate that forms the roof of the mouth as the Greater and Lesser Palatine Foramina on the Hard Palate, opposite the last molar tooth (where the Palatine Bone posteriorly sutures with the Maxilla anteriorly)

**Nerves that pass though the Pterygopalatine Fossa:**

- CN V2 leaves the skull via the Foramen Rotundum to enter the Pteygopalatine Fossa. From here, it then enters the Infraorbital Canal and travels anteriorly to emerge from the Infraorbital Foramen
- Within the Pterygopalatine Fossa, CN V2 gives off branches which either travel medially via the Sphenopalatine Foramen into the Nose and Roof of the Pharynx or anteriorly via the Infraorbital Fissure and Canal through the floor of Orbit or inferiorly through the Palatine Canal to enter the Palate
- Autonomic Nerves pass through the Pterygoid Canal to enter the Pterygopalatine Fossa where they join CN V2
- Therefore, as the Pterygopalatine Fossa contains many neurovascular structures, it is an important point of relay for these structures within the nose and midface

# Maxilla

- This occupies a large region of the skull, forming the anteromedial aspect of the Viscerocranium, between the Orbit laterally and the nose medially
- It is a fragile bone as it is highly porous, containing the large Maxillary Air Sinus/Antrum within its lateral aspects
- It contains the Infraorbital Canal which runs anteriorly through the floor of the Orbit to open onto the face at the Infraorbital Foramen, just inferior to the orbit
- This contains the lacrimal duct
- It forms the floor and lateral wall of the nasal cavity (together with the palatine bones)
- It forms most of the cheek and joins with the zygomatic bone here
- It articulates with the Zygomatic Bone laterally and the Sphenoid Superiorly

# Zygomatic Bone

- The Zygomatic Bone is palpable on the lateral aspect of the cheek and forms the majority of the cheek (the lateral aspect)
- It contributes to the lateral wall of the bony orbit the zygomatic arch

![E5HrwhHAzYQY5UhlkvMjmA_os_zygomaticum_atlas_pREqzwaN5NJo4ScEzcBwCg.jpg](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/E5HrwhHAzYQY5UhlkvMjmA_os_zygomaticum_atlas_pREqzwaN5NJo4ScEzcBwCg.jpg)

# Lateral Wall of the Nasal Cavity

- This is formed predominantly by the Maxilla and contains an opening in the Superoposterior aspect of the Maxillary Air Sinus into the Nasal Cavity
- Superior to this Opening, the Lateral Wall of the Nasal Cavity is formed by the Ethmoid
- The Palatine Bone and Sphenoid Bone moving Posteriorly contribute to the Posteroinferior Aspect of the Lateral Wall of the Nose
- There are three bony shelfs/processes that project medially and then curl over the air sinuses to project inferiorly
- These are called nasal conchae and they shape the lateral wall of the nose
- There are superior, middle and inferior conchae and beneath each of these, there is a Meatus
1. The superior and middle conchae are formed by the Internal Walls of the Ethmoid bone
2. The inferior concha is a separate bone which can fall off when the soft tissue is gone
- The inferior concha is the largest
- The conchae form air tunnels and increases the inner surface of the nasal cavity
- The conchae are covered in mucosa which contain the end branches of the olfactory bulbs
- This allows maximum exposure of the mucosa to better enable the special sense of smell
- It contains openings for access to the frontal, sphenoid and maxillary sinus as well as the lacrimal duct

# Medial Wall

- Medial Wall = Nasal Septum
- This is formed Superoposteriorly by the Perpendicular Plate of the Ethmoid and Posteroinferiorly by the Vomer and is continued anteriorly by Cartilaginous Septal Cartilage
- The Vomer is a wedge-like bone, Extending from the Cranial Base/Ethmoid Superiorly to the Floor of the Nose inferiorly, between the Maxilla and Palatine bones inferiorly and the Sphenoid posteriorly
- The floor of the nasal cavity is built from the Nasal Crest of the Maxillary Bone anteriorly and the Nasal Crest of the Palatine Bones posteriorly
- The Posterior wall of the Nasal Cavity is formed by the Sphenoid

# Paranasal Air Sinuses

- These are the air spaces of the skull which are lined with respiratory epithelium that is highly vascularised and innervated
- The Maxillary Air Sinus is the only facial sinus to not have a direct connection to the Nasal Cavity as they are directly connected to the Tympanic Cavity, which is connected to the Nasopharynx via the Auditory Tube
- They all open into the nasal cavity
- Bones of the facial skull are pneumatised (contain air sinuses)
- This may be to make them lighter
- They develop postnatally (except the Mastoid Sinus) and can be of very irregular or asymmetric shape
- There are the frontal, sphenoid, ethmoid and maxillary sinuses
- The sphenoid air sinus is clinically important as a surgical access point for the pituitary fossa within the Sella Turcica
- Pituitary tumours can be accessed via the nasal cavity, entering the sinus of the sphenoid and breaking through this thin wall of bone
- This prevents a need to enter the skull from above and potentially damage the brain

![f008-235ab-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/f008-235ab-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Maxillary Sinus

- This is the largest of the sinuses and fills most of the body of the Maxilla
- It is between the floor of the orbit posteriorly and the alveolar bone of the maxilla anteriorly, anterior to the Pterygopalatine Fossa
- It is pyramidal shaped, with the base being the lateral wall of the nose, its apex (inferiorly) being close to the Zygomatic Bone and its roof being the Floor of the Orbit, through which the Infraorbital Canal runs
- The Anterior wall of the Maxillary Sinus is found posterior to the cheek and behind its posterior wall lies the Pterygomaxillary Fissure laterally and the Pterygopalatine Fossa
- The tips of the tooth roots of several teeth protrude into the Maxillary Sinus to form irregular bumps on its floor
- This means that teeth abscesses can lead to prolonged Sinusitis
- It is filled with ciliated respiratory epithelium and these form a mucocilliary escalator which allows drainage of mucous
- If the maxillary sinus becomes infected, the Respiratory Mucous Membrane swells and fluid may collect in the cavity, which can be painful (especially when leaning forwards) in the face or even in the top teeth
- The Ostium through which the Maxillary Sinus drains is found along the Superior Aspect of its Medial Wall (Lateral wall of the Nasal Cavity), just inferior to the Middle Concha and just anterior to the Hiatus Semilunaris
- This is a groove that runs around the base of a swelling of the Lateral Wall formed by a bulging of some of the Ethmoidal Air Cells into the Middle Meatus called the Bulla Ethmoidalis
- Each Frontal Bone also contains an air sinus just lateral to the midline. Sometimes, there is a common sinus that extends across both sinuses and sometimes, one or other sinuses will be absent
- The walls of the Maxillary Sinus are paper-thin and can be damaged in Blow Out Fractures of the Orbit
- The opening is level in a newborn, but the more the face grows, the further down the air sinus goes

# Mucosa of the Air Sinuses

- The air sinuses are lined with respiratory mucous membrane and have rich vasculature and sensory supply
- The arteries supplying the sinuses are the supra-orbital and anterior ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic arteries as these are the arteries that are found closest to the Frontal Sinus, Sphenoid Sinus and to some extent, the Maxillary Sinus
- Venous drainage occurs through veins accompanying these arteries and join the supra-orbital and superior ophthalmic veins which drain through the Cavernous Sinus
- This means that through these veins, Sinusitis, they can be tracked to the Intracranial Fossa, where they can cause meningitis and encephalitis
- The lymph vessels drain into the submandibular group of nodes (particularly for the maxillary sinuses)
- When you have a cold/sinusitis there is swelling of the submandibular lymph nodes rather than deeper in the neck

# Paranasal Sinus Drainage

Towards the superior meatus (meatus = opening in the lateral wall):

1. Sphenoid sinus has two openings into the Sphenoethmoidal Recess, found in the Posterior Aspect of the Roof of the Nose
2. Posterior ethmoid air cells drain to the superior nasal meatus
- The superior meatus is tucked under the superior nasal concha

Towards the middle meatus:

1. The frontal sinus via the infundibulum (funnel-like opening) to the anterior aspect of the hiatus semilunaris, anterior to the superior concha
2. Anterior ethmoidal air cells drain to the semilunar hiatus, middle ethmoidal air cells and then bulla ethmoidalis, draining into the nasal cavity via holes which are found under the Middle and Superior Meati
3. Maxillary sinus drains via the ostium to the semilunar hiatus
- The middle meatus is underneath the middle concha
- Towards inferior meatus:
1. Nasolacrimal duct is where the lacrimal fluid is released
- This is located anteriorly underneath the inferior meatus
- The Sphenoidal Air Sinus opening is found most posteriorly
- Under the Middle Nasal Concha, the openings for the Frontal Sinus and Maxillary Air Sinus are found moving posteriorly (The Opening of the Maxillary Air Sinus is elongated, running along the Inferior Margin of the Middle Nasal Concha
- The Opening of the Auditory Tube is found at the level of the Floor of the Nose/Inferior Concha but posterior to the Conchae, with the Opening to the Nasolacrimal Duct being found under Anterior Aspect of the Inferior Concha

# Sinusitis

- This is a common complication that usually occurs after upper respiratory tract infections
- This causes the cilia of the Respiratory Epithelium within the sinuses to become dysfunctional whilst the mucous lining of the sinuses gets inflamed and swells, causing a sensation of pressure as there is a confined space
- Inflammation means that the drainage via the Ostia of the Sinuses becomes slow and ineffective, causing fluid to accumulate within the sinus cavity
- The most common forms of sinusitis are Maxillary and Frontal Sinusitis, which presents with pain in the anterior midface, which worsens upon bending the head forward
- Due to high neurovascularisation of the mucosa of the sinus, this is a very painful condition
- The Mucosa surrounding the ostium is the most sensitive area of each sinus
- The aim is to reduce swelling
- However, the swelling may block the superior and inferior meatuses depending on where the swelling is located
- This can block the drainage of the nasolacrimal duct or the maxillary or frontal sinus
- This aggravates the symptoms further as there is swelling but the drainage is blocked

### Maxillary Sinus Growth

- The Maxillary Sinus begins to form after brith
- As the face grows, the Epithelium of the Maxillary Sinus is drawn into the Body of the Maxilla from a point at the nose that will become the Ostium of the Maxillary Fossa
- The Ostium remains on the Superoposterior wall of the Sinus despite the face growing in height as the Sinus Cavity grows inferiorly
- This produces a disadvantageous drainage point high on the Medial wall of the Sinus which makes draining the Maxillary Sinus difficult but also prevents secretions from the Nasolacrimal Duct (which opens into the Inferior Meatus) from entering the Maxillary Sinus

---

# Tumours of the Air Sinuses

- Tumours of the linings of the air sinuses can develop
- The most common location for both benign and malignant tumours is the maxillary sinuses
- This is because this sinus has the largest opening in the Middle Nasal Meatus and close to the air stream that passes through the nose on inhalation, so there is a high chance of tracking particles into it which irritate the mucosa resulting in mutations
- They are particularly common in patients working in dusty conditions (e.g. carpenters)
- Tumours of the other air sinuses are rare

# Neurovascular Supply to the Nose and Paranasal Air Sinuses

### Mucosa of the Nose

- This is rich in mucous and serous glands
- The mucous is viscous to trap dust, bacteria and other particles and is removed from the Nasal Cavity via the GI Tract through the Pharynx
- Nasal vestibule (Anterior most aspect of Nasal Cavity) is lined with squamous epithelial mucous membrane
- This is where the naras (openings of the nose) are located
- Nasal hair helps keep out dust and other particles
- Posteriorly past the vestibule, the mucous lining is ciliated with respiratory epithelium
- This makes sure the mucus produced is directed towards the pharynx and directed down
- It is highly vascularised and innervated
- The Mucosa covering the surfaces of the Conchae contains olfactory receptors
- This increases the internal SA of the nose whilst its curved shape means the region of the Nasal Cavity under the Conchae is tubular
- The curved nature of the Conchae produces streamlined airflow through the tubular region of the Nasal Cavity under the Conchae, past the Mucosa of the Conchae

## Arteries

- Many of the Nerves that supply the Nose pass into the Lateral Wall, Roof of the Nose or the Midline Nasal Septum run alongside arteries

![f008-243-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/f008-243-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Maxillary Artery

- Many of these arteries that supply the nose are branches of the Maxillary Artery, which has a complicated path through the Pterygopalatine Fossa
- Branches of the Maxillary Artery pass medially from the Pterygopalatine Fossa through the Sphenopalatine Fossa to become the Lateral Nasal and Sphenopalatine Arteries

![Screenshot 2021-10-30 at 13.36.55.png](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/Screenshot_2021-10-30_at_13.36.55.png)

### Ethmoidal Arteries

- This is the blood supply superiorly
- These are branches of the ophthalmic artery (from the internal carotid), which enters the orbit via the Optic Canal before giving off the Anterior and Posterior Ethmoidal Arteries
- They reach the nasal cavity via the ethmoid bone, where it supplies the Mucosa of the Ethmoid Air Cells
- This supplies mostly the ethmoid area of the nose (Posterior Aspect of the Nasal Cavity)
- The Posterior Ethmoid Artery also supplies some aspects of the Sphenoidal Sinus
- The Anterior Ethmoidal Artery supplies the Superior Region of the Mucous Membrane of the Lateral Nasal wall and the Anterior Superior Alveolar Artery supplies the Inferior Region of the Mucous Membrane of the Lateral Nasal Wall
- The Posterior Ethmoid Artery doesn't supply a large aspect of the Lateral Nasal Wall
- Both the Anterior and Posterior Ethmoidal Arteries are found running along the Medial Wall of the Nose, supplying the Superior Half of the Septum Anteriorly and Posteriorly respectively

### Sphenopalatine Arteries

- These are branches of the Maxillary artery and thus external carotid within the Infratemporal Fossa (where it bends to run runs medially)
- They reach the nasal cavity via the pterygo-maxillary fissure and the sphenopalatine foramen b
- Sphenopalatine arteries enter the back of the nose via the pterygo-palatine canal
- Branches of the spheno-palatine arteries go on both the medial and lateral walls of the nose
- The Sphenopalatine artery supplies the Conchae and hence, is important for smell
- The sphenopalatine arteries anastomose with the posterior and anterior ethmoidal arteries on the anteroinferior aspect of the septum of the nose and on the Maxillary Bone
- From the Anteroinferior Septum, the Sphenopalatine Artery forms lots of anastomoses with Major Palatine Arteries of the Oral Cavity interferiorly via the Canalis Incisivus, through which branches run inferiorly (through the Maxilla) to supply the roof of the mouth
- There is a lesser degree of anastomoses on the lateral aspect of the nose between the anterior ethmoid arteries and the sphenopalatine branches
- There is further anastomoses between the sphenopalatine branches here and the branches of the maxillary artery that supply the roof of the nose as well

## Veins

![f008-244-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/f008-244-9780323393041.jpeg)

- There are lots of Venous Anastomoses within the Nose

### Ethmoidal Veins

- These drain via the ophthalmic veins to the central sinus and the internal jugular vein
- Some Ophthalmic Veins also drain to the Facial Vein, which drains anteriorly via the Retromandibular to drain into the Internal and External Jugular Veins

### Sphenopalatine Veins

- These drain to the maxillary vein and towards the retromandibular and internal/external jugular veins
- Some of these drain towards the infratemporal/pterygoid plexus of veins and then the external jugular veins

![f008-037-9780323531887.jpeg](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/f008-037-9780323531887.jpeg)

## Nerves (D&P)

- CN V is a mixed nerve and is the largest cranial nerve
- The Trigeminal Ganglion is located in Meckel's Cave (Depression in Petrous Temporal Bone) in the Middle Cranial Fossa and contains all the afferent cell bodies of CN V
- Distal to the Trigeminal Ganglion on the floor of the Middle Cranial Fossa, CN V Divides into the Ophthalmic, Maxillary and Mandibular Divisions which leave the Intracranial Region via the Superior Cranial Fossa, Foramen Rotundum and Foramen Ovale respectively to enter the Orbit, Pterygopalatine Fossa and Infratemporal Fossa respectively
- CN V3 is the only division of the Trigeminal Nerve that has motor fibres - CN V1 and V2 are completely sensory
- Within the Pterygopalatine Fossa, CN V2 divides into various branches:
1. Zygomatic Nerve - Runs superoanteriorly along the Lateral Wall of the Orbital Cavity and branches through the Zygomatic Bone to supply the skin overlying this region
2. Infraorbital Nerve - Runs anteriorly through the Infraorbital Canal to emerge deep to the cheek.
- It supplies sensation to the lower eyelid, lower palpebral conjunctiva, skin of the mid-face and upper lip
- Middle Superior Alveolar Nerves branch off the Infraorbital Nerve in the Roof of the Maxillary Sinus and also run into the Plexus on its floor, sometimes as far forwards as the Canine tooth and provide sensory innervation to these structures
- The Anterior Superior Alveolar Nerve is another branch of the Infraorbital Nerve
- It runs anteriorly to the incisor and canine teeth in the bone just inferior to the Nasal Margin to provide sensory innervation here
- It also gives off branches that supply sensation to the Anterior Aspect of the Lateral Wall of the Nose, the Floor of the Nose and the Anterior Aspect of the Midline Nasal Septum
- The 3 Alveolar Nerves means that all of the Upper Teeth receive their sensory innervation from CN V2

![Scannable Document 3 on 11 Nov 2021 at 6_30_11 pm.png](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/Scannable_Document_3_on_11_Nov_2021_at_6_30_11_pm.png)

1. Nasopalatine Nerve - This runs medially through the Sphenopalatine Foramen and into the roof and lateral nose to provide sensory innervation here
2. Palatine Nerves - They pass from the Pterygopalatine Fossa, through the Palatine Canal and out of the Greater and Lesser Palatine Foramina to provide sensory innervation to the Palate
- As they descend down to the Palate, they give off Lateral Branches to supply the Lateral wall of the Nose
1. Posterior Superior Alveolar Nerves - These run anteroinferiorly into the back of the Maxillary Tuberosity and through the Maxilla to form a plexus over the tip of the roots of the Upper Molar Teeth in the Floor of the Maxillary Sinus

![Scannable Document 2 on 11 Nov 2021 at 6_30_11 pm.png](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/Scannable_Document_2_on_11_Nov_2021_at_6_30_11_pm.png)

### Autonomic Nerves

- In the head, PSNS Ganglia are always found near the terminal branches of CN V
- The CIliary Ganglion is found in the Orbit near the Nasociliary Nerve from CN V1
- The Pterygopalatine Ganglion is found in the Pterygopalatine Fossa, connected to CN V3
- Like the other PSNS Ganglia in the Head, it is a relay station for PSNS Neurons that leave CN VII in the Greater Superficial Petrosal Nerve (The larger of the 2 Petrosal Nerves)

**Greater Petrosal Nerve**

- The Greater Petrosal Nerve passes anteriorly through a slit in the Anterior Aspect of the Petrous Temporal Bone to enter the Pterygoid Canal of the Sphenoid
- The Nerve runs through the Canal and carries the Preganglionic PSNS Fibres into the Pterygopalatine Fossa and then into the Pterygopalatine Ganglion (which is suspended from CN V2)
- These Preganglionic PSNS Fibres then synapse here and are distributed through all the sensory branches of the CN V2 towards their targets, alongside the SNS Fibres that travel with them as the Nerve of the Pterygoid Canal
- PSNS Secretomotor Fibres cause the secretion of mucous and serous gland in the nose, paranasal air sinuses and palate, as well as the secretion of tears by the Lacrimal Gland
- Their action is said to mimic the Sx of Hay Fever
- Some Postganglionic Secretomotor PSNS Neurons pass directly from the Pterygopalatine Ganglion into the Lacrimal Gland (not travelling within one of the Branches of CN V2)
- They do this by running anteriorly through the Inferior Orbital Fissure and onto the Posterolateral Wall of the Orbit. From here, they run anteriorly to innervate the Lacrimal Gland

### Deep Petrosal Nerve

- Like other PSNS Ganglia, the Pterygopalatine Ganglion also has other neurons passing through it on their way to their target organs, but not synapsing within the Ganglion
- These include SNS Neurons which have ascended along the Internal Carotid Artery and then entered the Pterygoid Canal in the Back of the Sphenoid
- As these fibres approach the canal, they converge to form the Deep Petrosal Nerve
- They Pass through the Pterygoid Canal alongside PSNS Neurons from CN VII to enter the Pterygopalatine Fossa
- Once here, SNS Fibres pass straight through the Pterygopalatine Ganglion and are distributed to the 'hay-fever' glands, where they are generally produce vasoconstriction
- Within the Pterygoid Canal, PSNS and SNS Neurons that run side-by-side form the Nerve of the Pterygoid Canal

![f008-157-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/f008-157-9780323393041.jpeg)

- The Nasopalatine Nerve passes through the Sphenopalatine Foramen, just inferior to the Superior Cocha at its posterior end, to enter the nose
- Branches of this cross the roof of the nose to reach the Anterior Aspect of the Nasal Septum and then Descends through the Incisive Foramen in the Floor of the Nasal Cavity to reach the Anterior Aspect of the Hard Palate
- Lateral Nasal Branches of CN V2 pass into the lateral Wall of the Nose from the Pterygopalatine Fossa

![Scannable Document 4 on 11 Nov 2021 at 6_30_11 pm.png](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/Scannable_Document_4_on_11_Nov_2021_at_6_30_11_pm.png)

### Anterior Ethmoidal Nerve

- The Anterior Ethmoidal Nerves are branches of the Nasociliary Nerve as it passes through the Orbit
- They leave the orbit through its medial wall and enter the Anterior Cranial Fossa
- From there, they enter the nose through the sides of the Cribriform Plates of the Ethmoid
- They carry sensory impulses from the Superoanterior segment of the nasal wall and the skin on the nose

### Olfactory Nerve (CN I)

- The Rootlets of the Olfactory Nerve carry the sensation of smell from special receptors located in the Upper Part of the Nasal Septum, Lateral Wall and Roof of the Nose
- These nerves ascend and pass through the Cribriform Plate of the Ethmoid Bone to reach the Olfactory Bulb that overlies it in the Anterior Cranial Fossa

# Epistaxis

- The Nasal Mucous Membrane has a rich blood supply, with Alternate Vasodilation and Vasoconstriction of vessels supplying this mucosa meaning that we often breath through one side of the nose only for short periods of the time
- This high vascularity means that the Nasal Mucosa is well adapted to warming and humidifying inspired air but also it is well adapted for heat loss when the core temperatures rise above 37°C (When the Px is febrile)
- Most nosebleeds stem from the vestibular/anterior part of the nose and particularly the nasal septum (lateral to the Cartilaginous aspect of the Septum)
- In this region of the Nasal Septum, there is a rich arterial anastomosis between branches of the Superior Labial, Anterior Ethmoidal, Sphenopalatine, Greater/Major Palatine and Anterior Superior Alveolar Arteries
- This is called Kisselbach’s plexus or Little’s area
- Bleeds from here can result from children sticking foreign objects in their nose or from sneezing too hard
- These nosebleeds tend not be severe and subside/clot off easily
    
    ![download.jpg](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/download.jpg)
    
- Posteriorly located nosebleeds often originate from a rich venous bed called Woodruff’s plexus on the posterior part of the inferior meatus (blue in diagram), deep in the nasal septum
- This is an area where the sphenopalatine artery is just dividing into its many branches and hence, can be damaged to produce a Posterior Epistaxis
- If this blood vessel ruptures, it results in a torrential nose bleed (more serious than Anterior Nose Bleeds)
- Bleeding may occur out of both nostrils
- These Posterior Epistaxis are usually prolonged and difficult to stop the bleeding as it is difficult to access the vasculature at the back of the nose
- Prolonged bleeds and ones that are difficult to control may require clinical intervention
- These Posterior Epistaxis happens more in hypertensive elderly patients, and blood vessels here can rupture easily
- These can result in fatal haemorrhage if they are not stopped properly
- The maxillary artery may need to be clipped off to stop the bleeding in order to reduce blood flow through the Sphenopalatine Artery
- With Posterior Epistaxis, there is a risk of bleeding inferiorly through the Choana into the Nasopharynx, where blood can be aspirated

# Lymphatic Drainage of the Nasal Cavity

- Posterior drainage is to the retropharyngeal nodes
- Anterior drainage is to the upper cervical or submandibular nodes
- Both drain to deep cervical nodes

# Cranial Nerves that Supply the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses - Add to D&P

![f008-245-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/f008-245-9780323393041%201.jpeg)

### V1 (Opthalmic Division of Trigeminal Nerve)

- Anterior and high up in the nose, innervation is via the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve
- The nasocillary nerve of the ophthalmic division supplies the outer skin of the nose, including the back of the nose, via the anterior ethmoid nerve which leads to the external nasal ramus
- The nasocillary nerve runs on the medial border of the orbit and enters down into the nasal cavity
- It gives off the anterior and posterior ethmoid nerves as end branches
- The anterior ethmoid nerve also supplies the mucous membrane of the anterior (vestibular part) of the nose, the skin over the bridge of the nose and skin on the forehead
- Another branch of the nasocillary nerve, the posterior ethmoid nerve, supplies the mucous membrane of the sphenoid and frontal sinus and the upper anterior part of the nasal mucosa

### Maxillary Division of Trigeminal Nerve (V2)

- The posterior part of the nose is innervated by the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve
- The main branch of the maxillary division, the maxillary nerve passes via the foramen rotundum into the pterygopalatine fossa where it branches
- It enters the floor of the orbit and goes through it
- The branches go down and through it
- The three important branches supplying the nose are:
1. Nasopalatine nerve via the sphenopalatine foramen to the roof and lateral wall of the nose
2. The superior alveolar nerves (anterior, posterior and middle)
3. The infraorbital nerve supplies the skin on the lateral aspect of the nose
- The superior alveolar and infraorbital nerves also supply the mucosa of the posterior nasal cavity and septum, the palate, the maxillary sinus and the gingiva (gums) of the maxilla

![Screenshot 2021-10-30 at 14.03.52.png](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/Screenshot_2021-10-30_at_14.03.52.png)

### Facial Nerve (CN VII)

- The facial nerve (VII) innervates the muscles that move the nose (facial expression muscles)
- The greater petrosal nerve of the facial nerve supplies the lacrimal gland and the mucous glands of the nose and palate with PSNS Fibres
- It triggers mucus production in the mucosa of the nose
- Therefore, when there is PSNS Stimulation of the Lacrimal Gland to produce tears, there will be more mucous produced in the nose and palate simultaneously
- The facial nerve goes through the internal acoustic meatus of the inner ear/middle ear and comes out through the stylomastoid foramen where it goes onto the face
- It then gives off the chorda tympani which joins the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve to supply taste sensation to the tongue
- The greater petrosal nerve is given off around the inner ear
- It travels in the auditory tube towards the centre of the skull towards the pterygo-palatal ganglion
- The greater petrosal nerve fibres join with the maxillary division in the pterygopalatine fossa, at the pterygo-palatal ganglion
- The fibres relay and part go with the maxillary division to the mucosa to stimulate mucus production
- The other part of the greater petrosal nerve will travel with the ophthalmic division to the lacrimal gland

# Olfaction

- This is carried out by the olfactory nerve
- It is a very complex process
- It is like taste sensations based on chemoreception
- Volatile odorants are trapped in mucous on the nasal conchae surface and interact with chemoreceptors here
- It is not fully understood how odorants bind/activate chemoreceptors (lock and key vs odorant vibration theory)
1. Lock and key: Every smell molecule has a distinct receptor
2. Odorant vibration theory: Similar or the same receptors are used for different molecule
- This was developed because there are more chemicals which can be smelt than there are receptors, with the receptors appearing relatively simple which could allow them to bind multiple different compounds (Low Selectivity) but react very differently to very similar compounds
- E.g 2 Identical Compounds with Hydrogen and Deuterium (Same Shape) smell completely different to one another as they excite the Olfactory Chemoreceptors differently
- It is not fully understood how the brain discerns different odours and where in the brain olfaction is linked (but it is known that smell is strongly linked to emotion and memory)
- Olfactory sensory neurons pass from the mucosa of the nose to the olfactory bulbs via the cribiform plate of the ethmoid
- They are highly regenerative neurons, olfactory bulb tissue is experimentally used for nerve damage repair in the spinal cord as a potential for treating paralysis
- The tissue has to be highly regenerative due to the high rates of turnover of the mucosa of the nose

![Screenshot 2021-10-30 at 14.20.08.png](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/Screenshot_2021-10-30_at_14.20.08.png)

### Olfactory Bulb

- The olfactory bulbs/bulbus olfactorius and their ultrastructure are considered necessary for coding of smell but recent evidence suggests that this may not be the case
- It was discovered that that approximately 0.6% of women who are also left-handed do not have apparent olfactory bulb structures in their Intracranial Fossa yet mostly show normal olfactory
perception and associated brain
activity in the piriform cortex/uncus
- This implies extreme plasticity in the functional neuroanatomy of this sense, where other structures can take over the olfactory coding processes of the Olfactory Bulb, and opens up discussion on what “normal” anatomy is regarding olfactory structures

![Screenshot 2021-11-21 at 23.55.57.png](%5B015%5D%20The%20Nose%20and%20Paranasal%20Air%20Sinuses%2079746adb3caf4bfc9df8b4cd90b6db6a/Screenshot_2021-11-21_at_23.55.57.png)

### Course for Nasogastric Intubation

- This is employed via the Nares anteriorly and Choanae Posteriorly for feeding patients and administering drugs
- It can also be used for gastric aspirations (draining the stomach) from harmful substances (e.g. poisoning)
- This can go through the cribriform plate or into the bronchial tree if done incorrectly
