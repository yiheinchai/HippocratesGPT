# How do Viruses Invade the CNS

- The brain lacks Dendritic Cells and Lymphoid Tissue, meaning that the stimulation of an Adaptive Immune Response must occur elsewhere in the Body where these cells are present, and then migrate into the CNS
- This occurs to limit inflammation within the Brain that can raise ICP whilst maintaining immunological protection/defence within the CNS
- Microglia are resident CNS Macrophages that can be replenished by Monocytes, which migrate through the BBB and differentiate to form Microglia within the CNS
- Trafficking, Activated Lymphocytes can cross the BBB to enter the CNS and mount an Immune Response here

- Rabies Virus (Often introduced into the Body via bite from an Infected Dog) replicates within Muscle and then invades Peripheral Nerves innervating the Muscle by binding the nAChRs
- It can then travel up peripheral Nerves to reach the Brain where it can cause Rabies Encephalitis and be fatal
- HSV-1 and HSV-2, latent predominantly in the Trigeminal and Sacral Ganglia respectively can migrate into the CNS during Primary Infection/Reactivation to cause disease
- HSV-1 more commonly causes Encephalitis and HSV-2 more commonly causes Meningitis (Notably in Young Women who contract Genital Herpes)
- When eating Beef from cows infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, Prions can travel up Splanchnic Nerves to reach the Brain and cause vCJD
- Nerves innervating the Nasal Mucosa can also transmit Viruses into the CNS (E.g SARS-CoV2 - Here, Infection of the Nasal Mucosa allows for SARS-CoV2 to enter the Brain via Olfactory Nerves where it can cause Anosmia)
- Main route of entry into the Brain for Viruses is via the Blood, from Cerebral Blood Vessels that run through the Brain Substance (Virus has to cross BBB) or via Meningeal Blood Vessels
- It is easier for Virus to cross Meningeal vs Cerebral Blood Vessels to enter the Brain

- Viruses can cross Cerebral Capillaries via:
1. Replication in Endothelial Cells, followed by release across their Basolateral Membrane to enter the Brain
2. Transcytosis across the Apical and then Basolateral Membranes to enter the Brain (Endocytosis from Capillary Lumen, Transcytosis across the Cell and Exocytosis across the Basolateral Membrane) - This is passive transfer of the Virus alongside normal molecules that are transported from the Blood into the Brain
3. Trafficking Lymphocytes or Monocytes that are infected with the Virus and then cross the BBB to enter the Brain
4. Directly/Passively through Fenestrae

- BBB contains Capillary Endothelial Cells connected by Junctions
- Blood-CSF Barrier contains Capillary Endothelial Cells with Fenestrations in the Choroid Plexus (Due to its Secretory role in CSF Production)
- Due to the presence of Fenestrations in the CSF, this makes it easier for Viruses to cross through these fenestrations to reach the CSF vs direct transit through the BBB (E.g Mumps)

# Viral Neurological Diseases

- Meningitis: inflammation of meninges.
- Symptoms include fever, headache and neck stiffness.
- This can be caused by Enteroviruses (Including Poliovirus), HIV, Mumps or HSV
- Encephalitis: inflammation of brain.
- Symptoms include drowsiness, mental confusion and convulsions.
- This can be caused by HSV (Notably Primary Infection in Young Children and Reactivation in Adults), Enteroviruses, Rabies, HIV or JC Viruses
- Autoimmune Encephalitis can be Post-Infectious (ADEM - Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis. This can be triggered by Measles)
- Anti-NMDA-R Encephalitis is associated with Teratomas rather than viruses
- Paralysis: due to lower or upper motor neuron lesions.
1. Flaccid paralysis: either due to infection of ventral horn cells of spinal cord causing destruction of lower motor
neurones or due to peripheral neuropathy with nerve conduction block (either demyelination or axon
damage). 
- It can occur due to Enteroviruses and also Post-infectiously (i.e. abnormal immune response).
1. Spastic paralysis: due to upper motor neuron lesions.
- This can be caused virally by Human T-Cell Leukaemia Virus (This also can cause Tropical Spastic Paraparesis)

# Poliovirus and CNS

- Family: Picornaviridae
- Genus: Enterovirus
- RNA virus (+ve sense) which is found as types 1, 2 and 3.
- RNA viruses do not have proof-reading, so rate of mutation is higher.
- It has a Capsid, but no envelope (resistant to environment - envelope
viruses are sensitive to environment).
- This lack of Envelope means that Poliovirus can transmit via the Faecal-Oral Route
- 90-95% of poliovirus infections are asymptomatic.
- 4-8% of infections produce minor, flu-like Sx
- In 1-2% of cases there is major illness ranging from meningitis to encephalitis and paralytic poliomyelitis:
1. Meningitis
2. Flaccid paralysis (often limited/localised): due to infection of ventral horn cells of spinal cord. 
- This may progress to respiratory failure and death via Flaccid Paralysis of Respiratory Muscles such as the Diaphragm.
1. Encephalitis (rarely)

# Poliomyelitis

- Refers to inflammation of the Grey Matter of the Spinal Cord due to damage to Motor Neurons within the Ventral Horn of the Grey Matter

![Screenshot 2022-01-10 at 23.48.44.png](%5B063%5D%20Polio%20ae8cd317daf94c429da6b50866369748/Screenshot_2022-01-10_at_23.48.44.png)

- Histologically, it is characterised by Tc Cell Invasion into the Ventral Horn (Lymphocytes identified by their large, darkly staining nuclei)

![Screenshot 2022-01-10 at 23.50.31.png](%5B063%5D%20Polio%20ae8cd317daf94c429da6b50866369748/Screenshot_2022-01-10_at_23.50.31.png)

- There is perivascular cuffing (leukocyte aggregation around capillaries) at blood-brain barrier where poliovirus attempts to enter spinal cord.

# Poliovirus Spread In the Body

- Poliovirus systemic infection involves an incubation period with replication of virus at multiple sites.
- It has an incubation period of 7-14 Days
- It enters the body via the GI Tract
- Secondary Viraemia is characterised by Febrile Illness
- At the beginning of the Antibody Response, Poliovirus can cross the Blood-CSF Barrier where it enters the CSF to cause Meningitis
- It can also cross the BBB where it can cause Encephalitis and Flaccid Paralysis via damage to the Ventral Horn

| Infection and Local Replication | GALT and then Local Lymph Nodes near the Infected GALT |
| --- | --- |
| Primary Viraemia | Blood Stream |
| Replication | Central Focus (Grows in the Liver and the Spleen) |
| Secondary Viraemia (Higher Viral Load than Primary Viraemia) | Bloodstream Â± CNS Invasion |
| Portal of Exit | Faeces |

# Laboratory Findings in Poliovirus Infection

![Screenshot 2022-01-10 at 20.33.05.png](%5B063%5D%20Polio%20ae8cd317daf94c429da6b50866369748/Screenshot_2022-01-10_at_20.33.05.png)

- Within the CSF, Lymphocytes can be found (Normally very sparse in the CSF) and increased CSF Proteins (Indicating Cerebral Inflammation) - These are indicative of Meningitis
- Virus can also be found in the Blood (During Primary and Secondary Viraemia), Throat and Faeces (During Invasion) and also in the CNS (During Meningitis and Encephalitis)
- Therefore, Poliomyelitis can be Dx via:
1. RT-PCR on Faecal Sample (This is not very accurate as most cases are asymptomatic so presence of Polio in the Faeces is not Indicative of Poliomyelitis)
2. CSF Analysis - Looking for evidence of Raised Protein and Lymphocyte Counts (Indications to Start Rx for Meningitis) whilst RT-PCR is conducted on the CSF to confirm presence of Poliovirus

# Polio Vaccine Development

- Poliovirus can be grown within a Monkey Kidney Cell Monolayer, with a Cytopathic Effect becoming evident due to Cell Death via Poliovirus

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 00.00.34.png](%5B063%5D%20Polio%20ae8cd317daf94c429da6b50866369748/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_00.00.34.png)

# Prevention and Eradication

- Immunity to wild-type infection is life-long and type-specific.
- Poliovirus has no animal reservoir (which makes eradication of the Virus via Vaccination possible)
- The OPV is inexpensive and effective, allowing it to be mass produced and widely distributed easily
- Vaccine for types 1, 2 and 3 can be:

| Type  | Example | Info |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Killed (Salk Vaccine) | Inactivated Polio Virus (IPV) | Wild Virus with Infectivity Destroyed as it is grown in Tissue Culture, Isolated and then Physically and Chemically Inactivated so that Humoural Immunity Vs Poliovirus can be developed (Provides Systemic/IgG Vs Mucosal/IgA Infection so does not prevent Infection but prevents Disease). As the Virus has been inactivated, it is safe to use in Immunocomprised individuals without the risk of reactivation, where it can cause disease |
| Live (Sabin Vaccine) | Oral Polio Virus (OPV) | Attenuated Avirulent Mutant - This induces Mucosal/IgA and Systemic/IgG Immunity to prevent Infection and Disease.  |

### Production of Attentuated Vaccine OPV

- Viruses is grown in Tissue Culture over many cycles until it mutates sufficiently to become non-virulent.
- Test virulence in monkeys, until they donât develop paralysis.
- Virus becomes non-virulent because it adapts to tissue culture instead of adapting to growing in human cells and hence, cannot infect human cells.

![Screenshot 2022-01-10 at 20.36.19.png](%5B063%5D%20Polio%20ae8cd317daf94c429da6b50866369748/Screenshot_2022-01-10_at_20.36.19.png)

### Molecular Basis of Attenuation

- Within 5 days of vaccination, there was the loss of the attenuating mutation at Position 472 of the Poliovirus found in Faecal Samples, making the Virus Virulent.
- This is likely due to the lack of Proof-Reading Mechanism in the Poliovirus, causing the Attenuated Mutation of the Poliovirus in the Vaccine to mutate to a Virulent Mutation

![Screenshot 2022-01-10 at 20.37.08.png](%5B063%5D%20Polio%20ae8cd317daf94c429da6b50866369748/Screenshot_2022-01-10_at_20.37.08.png)

### Rare Cases of Vaccine-Associated Poliomyelitis

- Attenuated polio vaccine (OPV) can revert to a virulent form in vaccine, where it can cause disease (This is in a very small number of cases).
- Polio cases did â after introduction of IPV, but after release of OPV, number of
cases â drastically.

# Eradication of Polio Programme

- This uses live polio vaccine (OPV) as it is cheaper and more effective than the IPV and hence, easy to distribute and produce, notably in poorer countries.
- Enormous progress has been achieved by National Immunisation Days and focal mass campaigns, causing significant reductions in the number of Poliovirus cases.
- In 2021, Wild-Type Poliovirus is endemic to Afghanistan and Pakistan - Notably due to a lack of Vaccine Administration due to Political Conflict disrupting Public Health Programmes
- However, there are a significant number of Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus infections (From the OPV), notably in Africa
- Whilst the Faecal-Oral Transmission route of Poliovirus often allowed for easy transmission of Poliovirus between people, producing immunity in individuals who have drank contaminated water and not received a Polio Vaccine, the potential for spread of Virulent Strains of Poliovirus derived from the OPV meant that some individuals can develop Poliomyelitis from water contaminated with Faeces from individuals who have received the IPV

### Surveillance of Polio

- Dx of Acute flaccid paralysis (Hallmark of Acute Poliomyelitis).
- Laboratory diagnosis
- Surveillance of sewage water to detect Virulent Poliovirus that has been shed in Faeces by an individual who has received the OPV.

### Polio Risk from OPV

- 1/3,000,000 recipients.
- 1/1,000,000 contacts.
- Agammaglobulinemic (donât have any antibodies) risk 10,000 greater as Humoural Immunity is more significant in defense against Enteroviruses (via Mucosal IgA Immunity) than Cell-Mediated Immunity
- These individuals with Ab should therefore not receive the OPV.

### Problems with Poliovirus Eradication

- After receiving the OPV, Poliovirus is shed in the Faeces for 6 Weeks, commonly in Children, during which the Avirulent Poliovirus strain can revert to Neurovirulence and be transmitted to others who are unimmunised
- In some cases, there has been evidence of Persistent Shedding of Neurovirulent Poliovirus from Px who have Ab deficiencies
- E.g A Px who was 24 was Dx with Ab Deficiency at Age 15 due Multiple Infections
- Before his Dx of Ab Deficiencies, he had been given the OPV and had been shedding Neurovirulent Poliovirus in his faeces from the time he received his OPV until the present

### Comparison of Nucleotide Variation and Neurovirulence of Type 2 Poliovirus

|  | OPV 2 Vaccine Strain | Virus from a Case of Polio | Day 1,036 Virus From Px who Persistently Shed Poliovirus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base 481.5â NCR | A | G | G |
| Amino Acid 143 VP1 (Capsid Protein) | ILE | VAL | THR |
| Clinical Score Paralysis % in Monkeys | 0/4 (0%) | 4/4 (4%) | 4/4 (4%) |
|  |  |  |  |

# Current Situation Regarding the Global Eradication of Polio

- OPV is being replaced by IPV to prevent the widespread development of Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus Infection
- However, Problems still persist that oppose Polio Eradication worldwide via Vaccine Cover/Surveillance, War, Persistant Shedding of Poliovirus from Vaccines and hence, Infection within the Immunocompromised
