# [046] Vestibular System and Locomotion

# Vestibular Apparatus

- Utricle and saccule detect linear (translational) accelerations/long term positional shifts in the head.
- Semi-circular canals detect angular (rotational) accelerations (movements of the Head at the neck).
- The 3 Semicircular Canals are found roughly in the Sagittal, Coronal and Transverse Planes
- This produces a 3 plane system allows all rotation in any plane to be detected.
- Pitch Movement = Rotation of the Head in the Sagittal Plane
- Horizontal Movement = Rotation of the Head in the Transverse Plane
- Yaw Movement = Rotation of the Head in the Coronal Plane
- Membranous labyrinth is filled with K⁺ rich endolymph.
- Ampullae within these structures detect these movements via specialised regions here that detect endolymph movement

# Cristae and Maculae

**Cristae**

- It contain hair cells (mechanoreceptors) that are embedded within the Cupula in the Ampullae of the Semicircular Canals
- The Gelatinous Cupula extends from the Projections of Hair Cells to the Opposite Wall of the Ampulla to completely block off the Semicircular Canal
- When there is head rotation, endolymph moves and presses on/deviates the Cupula and cause it to bulge (which extends across the walls of the Semicircular Canal to prevent Endolymph Movement through the Canal)
- This movement of the Cupula causes the Hair Cells embedded within it to deviate, activating these and firing an Afferent AP to the Vestibular Nerve

Maculae

- It contain hair cells within the Ampulla of the Saccule and Utricle that are embedded into a gelatinous
otolithic membrane covered in calcium carbonate crystals
(otoconia).
- During changes in head inclination (Head moves but not at the neck) and translational movements (in a linear direction), the Otoconia are pulled by Gravity and therefore, deviate the Otolithic Membrane, stimulating the embedded hair cells here so that they fire an afferent AP into the Vestibular Nerve
- These hair cells are not directly connected to semi-circular canals.

# Vestibular Apparatus - Hair Cells

- Projections from the Cell Body of Hair Cells extend into Gelatinous Membranes and are comprised of Multiple Steroocilia and a single Kinocilium, with the relationship/distance between the Stereocilia and Kinocilium giving the hair cells directionally sensitive properties
- Deviation of stereocilia towards kinocilium depolarises cells and
leads to ↑ afferent activity/firing rate towards CN VIII.
- Deviation of stereocilia away from kinocilium hyperpolarises cells and reduced afferent activity/firing

# Descending Vestibulospinal System

- There are Superior, medial, lateral and inferior vestibular nuclei.
- The Lateral Vestibular Nucleus forms the Lateral Vestibulospinal Tract whereas the Other Nuclei form the Medial Vestibulospinal Tract
- This is Important for posture and balance.

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 20.39.14.png](%5B046%5D%20Vestibular%20System%20and%20Locomotion%2007c2554dddf64133bac1b6625772c1cd/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_20.39.14.png)

# Postural Adjustments Require Anticipatory Motor Responses

- Person standing with 2 feet is asked to move right lower limb to right whilst maintaining posture.
- Although patient was asked to move lower limb to right, last thing to move was ankle and the first thing to move was hip (in opposite direction), then Contralateral shoulder (in opposite direction).
- This explains that moving lower limb to right, body must lean to left before moving to right, meaning anticipatory (and often opposing) responses are required to make postural adjustments to maintain balance
- This means that Postural Movements precede voluntary movements to maintain stability/balance

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 20.40.20.png](%5B046%5D%20Vestibular%20System%20and%20Locomotion%2007c2554dddf64133bac1b6625772c1cd/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_20.40.20.png)

- These anticipatory motor responses to Postural Disturbances can be learned and improved over time
- Subject asked to stand upright, then platform is moved a fixed distance posteriorly at random points
- When the Feet are pulled backwards, and centre of gravity now moves, so subject leans forwards (stretching the Triceps Surae), unless they can compensate by contracting the Triceps Surae.
- **EMG** (gastrocnemius or soleus): as platform starts to move, there is initially very little response in soleus/gastrocnemius, causing the subject to lean forwards significantly.
- With time with repetitive platform movements, The patient can predict movement of platform and what impact this will have on balance/body positioning and how to sufficiently compensate for this by contracting soleus/gastrocnemius.
- Progressively over time, contraction of gastrocnemius/soleus is made earlier and stronger (as soon as movement of platform is felt), enabling better compensation and hence, reducing the magnitude of tilt seen.
- This shows learning and adapting (anticipatory responses).
- Tilting the same platform upwards tilts the Px back and Induces stretch of gastrocnemius and soleus, triggering the Muscle Stretch Reflex, causing Triceps Surae to contract and pull the subject further backwards.
- If subject learns and anticipates this, they will learn to suppress stretch reflex to reduce the Contraction of Gastrocnemius and Soleus, reducing the magnitude of tilt produced.
- These adaptations occur via the Integration of Proprioceptive (Mainly) and Vestibular (Minor) Information by the Cerebellar Anterior Lobe

# Cerebellar Anterior Lobe Damage

- Damage to the Cerebellar Anterior Lobe (Mainly Vermis but consists of Spinocerebellum and Vestibulocerebellum) prevents the learning of Anticipatory Postural Responses to a predictable platform displacement and hence, there is a distinct lack of Compensatory Muscle Activity to maintain a stable Posture
- Subjects learns to adapt after they experience each magnitude of movement as the movements produced are predictable.
- Random movement (where Magnitude of the Movement is constantly changing) is unlearnable as the Cerebellum cannot predict the result of the movements and the compensatory muscle action required to maintain a stable posture.
- Cerebellar lesion patient cannot learn predictability and cannot modify muscular activity in order to maintain an upright posture. - here
- This means that the Cerebellum is crucial in Motor Learning involving Anticipation of Postural Disturbances and organising the required compensatory muscle action to oppose this

# Vestibulospinal and Cervicospinal Reflexes

- Vestibulospinal and Cervicospinal Reflexes act synergistically to maintain body posture
- In an upright quadruped, the weight is equally distributed between the 2 Front Limbs so that the Vertical and Horizontal Axes are perpendicular
- When the Trunk and the Head are rotated together to one side (Shifting the Centre of Gravity to one side), producing Vestibular Stimulation as both the Vertical and Horizontal Axes are rotated but still perpendicular to one another
- This produces reflex activation of Extensor Muscles on the Grounded Limb (Side closes to Centre of Gravity) and reflex activation of Flexor Muscles on Contralateral Side (Side furthest from Centre of Gravity) - Vestibulospinal Reflex
- This ensures that the Centre of Gravity is shifted entirely over a stable grounded limb so that a stable posture and balance is maintained
- When the Trunk is rotated but the Head is Fixed (Produced by shifting the Shoulder in opposite directions superiorly and inferiorly, usually by lifting limb but not leaning to one side), This means the Vertical Axis of the Body remains unchanged whilst the Horizontal Axis is shifted - These axes are no longer perpendicular and therefore, the Centre of mass is shifted
- As the Head has not changed position, there is no Vestibular Drive/Reflex but rather, trunk rotation stretches Cervical Muscles (on the side where the shoulder is lowered), triggering Reflex Extension of the Grounded Limb (Closest to COM) and Reflex Flexion of the Limb furthest from COM - Cervicospinal Reflex
- This ensures that the Centre of Gravity is shifted entirely over a stable grounded limb so that a stable posture and balance is maintained
- When there is Lateral Bending of the Neck (this leads to Vestibular Changes and Cervical Stretch and hence, Vestibular and Cervical Drive), there is no significant shift in the Centre of Mass so therefore, no reflex is required to maintain a Stable Posture

# Ascending Vestibuloocular System

- More important drive than vestibulospinal system.
- These Neurons ascends within the medial longitudinal fasciculus and project to 6th, 4th and 3rd CN nuclei (CN nuclei that control eye movement).
- This allows for compensatory eye movements to be produced by the Oculomotor System to be produced in response to Head Rotation (The Degree of which is detected by Semicircular Canals) to maintain/stabilise Gaze/Fixation
- When wearing glasses, lenses distort vision and therefore, the Ascending Vestibulo-Ocular System adjusts for this so that the Angulation of Eye and Head Movements are not exactly equal so that Gaze is fixed
- Fixation = keeping gaze on an object (not same as focusing) so that the eye appears to stay still within space.
- This system is extremely fast, with large myelinated axons, to ensure that there is accurate coordination of the Vestibular and Extraocular Systems - When this reflex becomes inaccurate, vision is lost

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 20.47.22.png](%5B046%5D%20Vestibular%20System%20and%20Locomotion%2007c2554dddf64133bac1b6625772c1cd/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_20.47.22.png)

# Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex

- This is used to stabilise gaze when the head changes position

**Considering the Horizontal Plane (Same Principles Apply for All 3 Planes)**

- Turning head to the left in the Horizontal Plane causes the horizontal semi-circular canal to move to the left
- Endolymph has relative movement to the right (Canal Moves whilst the Endolymph remains still), displacing hair cells in this direction.
- This activates vestibular afferents, projecting to lateral and medial vestibular nucleus.
- The Lateral Vestibular Nucleus then projects to ipsilateral oculomotor nucleus, feeding the ipsilateral medial rectus to move the ipsilateral eye in the opposite direction of the head movement.
- The Ipsilateral Reflex Arc for the Vestibulo-Ocular reflex has at least 3 Neurons (Semicircular Canal → Vestibular Nucleus → Extraocular Muscle Nucleus → Extraocular Muscle)
- The Medial Vestibular Nucleus projects to the Contralateral Abducens Nucleus, which in turn projects to the Contralateral lateral Rectus to move the Contralateral Eye in the Opposite direction of the Head Movement
- The Medial Vestibular Nucleus also sends Inhibitory Projects to the Ipsilateral Abducens Nucleus and Contralateral Oculomotor Nucleus (Inhibits the Nuclei that are excited on the other side), to relax the Ipsilateral lateral Rectus and Contralateral Medial Rectus (Antagnist) so that the actions of the stimulated agonist is unopposed
- The Specific Extraocular Nuclei that the Lateral and Medial Vestibular Nuclei project to Ipsilaterally and Contralaterally respectively depends on the Direction the head is moved and the Extraocular Muscles that must be activated in order to produce compensatory eye movements

# Cerebellum in Vestibuloocular Reflex

- The Cerebellum is critical for calibration and maintenance of vestibular reflexes, their accuracy and therefore, postural control
- Vestibular information passes to cerebellar flocculus via mossy/parallel fibres.
- When the eyes are not moved sufficiently/moved too much during the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex for a given amount of head movement (Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex is inaccurate), the Visual Word/Field shifts/slips on the Retina, producing Retinal Slip
- Retinal Slip Errors and their direction (Whether slip is due to excess of lack of sufficient eye movement) are passed through Afferents to the Pretectal Nucleus, which projects to the Inferior Olive
- The Inferior Olive then projects Climbing Fibres to the Flocculus via the Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle to allow for the Vestibulocerebellum to correct this error
- Vestibular Afferents (CN VIII) give off collaterals that project to the Granule Cell Layer of the Cerebellar Cortex, with Granule Cells sending millions of Parallel Fibres superficially which report the Velocity of Head Rotation to the Flocculus
- The Flocculus then projects back to the Vestibular Nucleus to alter outflow to the Extraocular Muscles and their nuclei in order to correct the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex and restore its accuracy
- Climbing fibre inputs instruct a modification of Granule Cell parallel fibre synaptic efficacies on the Purkinje Cells within the Flocculus to alter the Outflow of the Flocculus onto the Vestibular Nucleus and hence, the corrections that are produced by altering the activity of the Extraocular Nuclei and muscles to correct the Retinal Slip (Eye movements become coordinated to Head Movements)
- Vestibular compensation (after labyrinth damage) as in Meniere’s disease is also cerebellum-dependent

# Locomotion

### Early Studies

- Basic stepping patterns do not depend upon supraspinal structures and therefore, these are organised by circuitry within spinal cord to produce a basic stepping pattern.
- Spinal stepping circuits are activated by descending tonic activity from brain.
- Spinal pattern generator activity does not depend upon sensory inputs, but it is strongly influenced by proprioception from limbs (shown as destruction of Dorsal Roots did not affect alternating flexor-extensor activation seen in locomotion).

### Stepping

- Stepping is an alternative sequence of stance and swing.
- It requires a complex sequence of joint extensor and flexor activation (not synchronous activation of extensors followed by flexors) as locomotion involves movement at multiple joints.

### Half-Centre Hypothesis

- This hypothesis suggests how we might get an alternating activity between extensors and flexors in locomotion.
- Graham Brown suggested a spinal network with excitation of flexor and extensors and crossed inhibition of spinal neurons.
- In this network, Spinal Neurons project to Flexor Motor Neurons and give off collaterals that project to an Inhibitory Interneuron that decussates to synapse on a Contralateral Spinal Neuron that projects to Contralateral Extensor Motor Neurons
- This contralateral Spinal Neuron also gives off collaterals that project to an Inhibitory Interneuron that decussates to synapse on a Contralateral Spinal Neuron that projects to Contralateral Flexor Motor Neurons
- This means that activation of the Spinal Neuron controlling the Flexor Motor Neuron activates the flexor but also inhibits the Contralateral Spinal Neuron controlling the Extensor Motor Neuron, inhibiting the Contralateral Extensor
- When  both Spinal Neurons in the Crossed Inhibition circuit receive neural input, the Spinal Neuron with the strongest input will be activated and the Contralateral Spinal Neuron will be inhbited
- However, over time, the Activated Spinal Neuron will tire and become fatigued, causing its activity to fall, reducing its inhibition of the Contralateral Spinal Neuron
- This inhibition will continue to decrease until the Activity of the Contralateral Neuron exceeds that of the Ipsilateral Spinal Neuron, causing the Contralateral Spinal Neuron to begin to inhibit the Ipsilateral Neuron and excite the extensor
- This fatiguing of Spinal Neurons leads to oscillations in Activated Spinal Neurons/Half Centres within this neural circuit, producing alternate flexion and extension activation
- Together with additional, pattern generating circuits, this type of neural network is known as a central pattern generator (CPG).
- These have not been directly identified in humans but this is likely to be the mechanism underlying Spinal Generation of a basic stepping pattern

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 20.51.09.png](%5B046%5D%20Vestibular%20System%20and%20Locomotion%2007c2554dddf64133bac1b6625772c1cd/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_20.51.09.png)

### Flexor Reflex Afferences Activate Spinal Central Pattern Generators

- Flexor Reflex Afferents = Aδ Fibres
- These can drive flexor-extensor oscillator activity by activating Spinal CPGs due to their input on Spinal Neurons involved in these CPG Neural Circuits
- In spinal cats, L-DOPA (thought to act on presynaptic receptors to stimulate increased DA and NA Release) treatment and electrical stimulation of FRAs (small diameter cutaneous and muscle afferents) produced long bursts of Flexor/Extensor Activation:
- In flexor MNs, ipsilateral FRA (Flexor Reflex Afferent) stimulation increases their activity.
- In extensor MNs, contralateral FRA stimulation increases their activity.

# Descending/Supraspinal Pathways for Initiation and Adaptive Control of Walking

1. Mesencephalic Locomotor Region
- there is a centre in mesencephalon below inferior colliculus in the Rostral Pons (mesencephalic locomotor region and projects to mesencephalic reticular formation in front of pons).
- As the Medial/Mesencephalic Reticular Formation is the source of the Reticulospinal Tract, this region is a source of reticulospinal drive (influences locomotion).
- If this is active, it will drive reticulospinal system to produce stepping (makes stepping faster and more extensive.
1. Cerebellar control
- It projects to and hence influences the Lateral Vestibular Nucleus, which influences the Vestibulospinal Tract and other brainstem regions, important in the adjustment of Stepping
- The Cerebellum receives proprioceptive and somatosensory information from the Spinocerebellar Tract and uses this to adjust its descending influences on stepping
1. Motor Cortex
- Involves in fine adjustment of stepping via the Corticospinal System
1. Role of visual cortex
- This can influence the activity of the Motor Cortex by adjusting where steps should be made

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 20.53.38.png](%5B046%5D%20Vestibular%20System%20and%20Locomotion%2007c2554dddf64133bac1b6625772c1cd/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_20.53.38.png)

### Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR)

- MLR receives inputs from basal ganglia, sensory and motor cortices and limbic system and projects caudally to medial reticular formation that is the source of reticulospinal tract.
- As the Reticulospinal Tract reaches the Medulla, it bifurcates and descends in the Ventrolateral Funiculus to stimulate the CPG Locomotor Circuitry in the Spinal Cord to produce locomotion
- Stimulation of the MLR activates locomotion by increasing the rate and pattern of stepping
- Stimulation of serotonergic neurons in the Raphe nuclei also evokes locomotion.
- The pattern of stimulation of the MLR or Raphe Nuclei is not important but strength of stimulation is critical.
- Low intensity causes walking whereas higher levels of stimulation trotting and the highest levels produce galloping.

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 20.54.31.png](%5B046%5D%20Vestibular%20System%20and%20Locomotion%2007c2554dddf64133bac1b6625772c1cd/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_20.54.31.png)

### Lateral Vestibular Nucleus (LVN) and Red Nucleus (RN)

- Lateral Vestibular Nucleus is source of lateral vestibulospinal tract that generally facilitates extensor mechanisms.
- The Red Nucleus is source of rubrospinal tract that facilitates flexors.
- Phasic activity (Levels of Activity vary with Time) in LVN adds to locomotor activity of extensor muscles while phasic activity in RN augments locomotor activity of flexor muscles without changing locomotor rhythm (which under normal circumstances, is determined by CPG cycling and the influence of the MLR on these CPGs)

### Cerebellum

- It strongly influences the rhythmic activity in LVN and RN is itself dependent upon cerebellum.
- Therefore, Cerebellar lesions cause uneven stepping as activity of the Lateral Vestibular Nuclei and Red Nuclei become less closely regulated.

### Motor Cortex

- Where it is important to place feet in a specific location, visual inputs to motor cortex help it guide final foot position in stepping.
- When walking on plain surface (during normal walking) there little activity from motor cortex to do with stepping however when one needs to step over an obstacle/the walking environment changes and hence, locomotion/stepping pattern must change significantly, the Input of the Visual to the Motor Cortex allows the individual to step over the Obstacle, causing a spike in Motor Cortex activity just before the step is made.
