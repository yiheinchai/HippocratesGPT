# [002] Superficial Structures in the Neck

# Overall Organisation of the Neck

### Compartments of the Neck

- The neck is a tube-like passageway between the head and the thorax for the Trachea, Oesophagus and various neurovascular structures
- With the vertebral column in the middle as a dividing structure, there are anterior and posterior compartments in the neck
- Each of these compartments is covered with Deep/Investigating Fascia of the Neck

**Posterior Compartment**

- The posterior compartment is, in essence, the vertebral column itself and its thick associated musculature
- The musculature here (Post and Prevertebral) must be strong to keep the head upright so that it does not fall forwards onto the chest at rest in the upright position
- These muscles are erector spinae, as well as muscles on the anterior aspect of the vertebrae as well (e.g. rectus capitis)
- These are very long and thin muscles that fine tune movement at the back
- The whole compartment is packaged in fascia

**Anterior Compartment**

- The anterior compartment contains the mobile part of the neck (Respiratory Tract, Digestive Tract and Neurovasculature)
- The Musculature of the Anterior Compartment (Prevertebral Muscles) are rather weak as their action is aided by gravity in the upright position
- The posterior column is the one that moves your neck
- At the same time there are lots of structures (Trachea, Oesophagus and Neurovascular Structures) that pass through here which go to the thorax and abdomen:
1. The pharynx and oesophagus
2. The larynx and trachea
- These structures need to be freely mobile so we can swallow and breathe, independent to the posterior column of the neck
- Neurovascular Structures and Lymph Nodes (Vascular Compartment) are found posterolateral to the Oesophagus + Trachea (Anterior Compartment) and Anterolateral to the Posterior Compartment
- The Thyroid Gland is found surrounding the Superolateral Aspects of the Anterior Trachea, at the root of the neck
- These two columns need to be able to slide past each other to allow for independent breathing and swallowing and can move independently to one another
- The anterior and posterior compartments are kept as functional distinct units by wrappings of Investing/Deep Fascia which surround the compartments, as if the structures in the anterior compartment separated during motion their function would be restricted
- The Pretracheal Fascia surrounds and Encloses the Trachea, Oesophagus and Thyroid
- This fascia is well defined over the Prevertebral Muscles (Prevertebral Fascia) and in the midline posteriorly between the Posterior Compartment Muscles (Ligamentum Nuchae)

### Deep Cervical Fascia

- On the left, there is an image of the superficial cervical fascia which is the outermost layer of fascia underneath the skin
- This has a thin layer of muscle called the platysma embedded into it, extending from the Superficial Cervical Fascia and Skin over the chest and clavicle and sweeps superiorly over the anterior and lateral aspects of the neck to insert into the Deep Fascia of the Neck, Lower border of the Mandible and the Deep Fascia of the Lower Face
- This raises the hair follicles on the face and mainly acts to move the skin of the lower face inferolaterally
- This is innervated by CN VII as it is a muscle of Facial Expression
- Humans have a negligible platysma
- Other animals have a more extensive platysma where the extension reaches the vertebral column
- The bigger muscle is due to the fact that, when it is contracted it makes the animal's neck appear bigger

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 11.54.22.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_11.54.22.png)

- Underlying this is the deep cervical fascia, which encloses the neck all the way around
- The Deep Cervical Fascia is complete around the neck, surrounding the neck from the Mandible Superiorly to the Clavicle inferiorly, enclosing the SCM and Trapezius and extending around the posterior aspect of the neck
- It attaches to the sternum, clavicle laterally, goes posteriorly over the Acromia and Spines of the scapulae to attaches to and encompass the muscle fascia of the trapezius.
- It then goes from the Attachment of the Trapezius up and attaches to the nuchal part of the head, travels anteriorly to cover the Mastoid Process, External Acoustic Meatus, Zygomatic Arch and overlies the Masseter
- It then descends from the Zygomatic Arch and to the Inferior Border of the Mandibular Ramus and Body to attach to the Superior Border of the Sternum and Clavicle
- It completely encloses all of the structures of the neck from the Mandible Superiorly and the Clavicle inferiorly (SCM, Trapezius, Extensor Muscles of the Neck)
- In the Midline of the Anterior Neck inferiorly, the Deep Cervical Fascia splits into an Anterior and Posterior Layer that attaches to the Anterior and Posterior Surface of the Manubrium
- This forms a suprasternal space between the Manubrium Inferiorly, the Bifurcation of the Deep Cervical Fascia superiorly and the Anterior and Posterior Layers of the Deep Cervical Fascia anteriorly and posteriorly
- This contains some fatty tissue and the Jugular Venous Arch (which runs transversely across the Suprasternal Notch to connect the Anterior Jugular Veins)
    
    ![sup and deep cervical fascia jpeg.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/sup_and_deep_cervical_fascia_jpeg.jpeg)
    
    ![428121_1_En_27_Fig2_HTML.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/428121_1_En_27_Fig2_HTML.png)
    
- It has three layers, each of which can be divided into individual fascial layers which allow various structures within the neck to move freely and smoothly against one another:
1. The outermost layer of the deep cervical fascia is called the superficial/investing/anterior layer
- It encloses the trapezius posteriorly and sternocleidomastoid anteriorly and has an invagination which forms the carotid sheath, which covers the common carotid artery and the
internal jugular vein
- The trapezius is slightly outside but is also held by it
1. The middle layer is the middle/pretracheal layer is anterior
- This is a sleeve in the Medial Aspect of the Anterior Compartment and encloses the infrahyoid muscles anteriorly, thyroid gland and oesophagus posteriorly
- It is effectively a package of the structures in the moveable anterior compartment which allows it to slide against everything else in this compartment
1. The deepest layer is the prevertebral/deep/posterior
- This encloses the muscles round the vertebral column and make sure they are separate from other structures (Posterior Compartment)
- It encloses the erector spinae, prevertebral muscles and scaleni
    
    ![f008-162-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f008-162-9780323393041.jpeg)
    
- Whilst the layers of the Deep Cervical Fascia are closely associated with one another, between the pretracheal anteriorly and prevertebral layers posteriorly, there is a little bit of space to allow the movement of the structures in the pretrachial fascia against the prevertebral fascia
- Exudate, blood, pus or other fluids can break through the walls of the fascia that enclose the region containing the structures passing from the neck to the trunk/thorax, allowing infections to spread from the head/pharynx to the thorax
- For example
1. An abscess caused by an issue with a tooth could cause inflammatory problems in the thorax
2. Gangrene from the head and neck could spread to the thorax
- This space is therefore called the “danger space”

# Musculoskeletal System of the Neck

### Cervical Vertebrae

- There are always 7
- These have small transverse processes.
- There are holes (foramina transversaria) that run between the rib-analogue and the transverse processes.
- Transverse foramen are only found in cervical vertebra
- The vertebral blood vessel and vein run through here
- These supply and drain blood to/from the brain
- They have characteristic spinous processes which are often bifurcated (two tips), where neck muscles attach.
- They have rather large vertebral canals
- The articular processes have joint facets which are cranially orientated. This is visible in the axial plane (Looking from above or below)
- There are additional joints (e.g. uncinate joints) formed between the uncinate processes of neighbouring vertebral body
- The Cervical Vertebrae provides the neck with a strong musculoskeletal framework whilst allowing it to be mobile
- There are 8 Pairs of Cervical Spinal Nerves as C1 leaves the vertebral Column above the First Cervical Vertebra (Between C1 and the Base of the Skull) whilst the C2-C8 leave via their associated Intervertebral Foramen
- The Dorsal Rami of Cervical Vertebrae provide motor innervation to the Extensor Muscles/Erector Spinae of the Neck and Sensory innervation to the Skin found superficial to them
- C1-C4 = Mixed Spinal Nerves that project inferomedially to supply the neck muscles and provide cutaneous sensation to the neck
- C5-C8 project inferolaterally to join the Brachial Plexus
- The Distal ends of the Transverse Processes of Cervical Vertebrae ends in 2 Tubercles, an Anterior and Posterior Tubercle, through which the Cervical Ventral Rami pass to enter the neck via the Anterior and Middle Scaleni

![f002-020a-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f002-020a-9780323393041.jpeg)

- C1 (atlas) is a ring structure which has no vertebral body and connects directly to the skull and thus connects the rest of
the vertebral column to the skull via the occipital condyles.
- This allows for nodding (flexion/extension)
- C2 (axis): The body of the axis has a process called the dens which fits into the hole in C1. It is secured into this with a ligament behind it.
- This forms a pivot joint (Atlanto-Axial Joint)
- C7 has a spinous process that looks like one belonging to thoracic vertebrae as it has a non-bifurcated spinous process
- C1 and C2 are very important in facilitating head and neck movements
- The Rib, Transverse and Spinous Processes are common attachment sites for Muscles of the Neck

![f008-008-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f008-008-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Scaleni Muscles

- They are found Lateral to the Cervical Vertebral Column, Anterolateral to the Erector Spinae (Deepest Muscle of the Lateral Neck)
- They are lifters of the first and  second ribs when the neck is fixed, but also laterally bend the neck
- There are three scaleni; anterior, middle and posterior
- They originate from the Anterior (Anterior Scalene) and Posterior (Middle and Posterior Scaleni) Tubercles of the Transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae
- The anterior and middle scalene insert onto the first rib
- The posterior scalene inserts onto the first and second ribs
- The Middle Scalene can sometimes also attach onto Ribs 2 as well as Rib 1
- Between the anterior and middle scaleni there is a gap called the scaleni gap, through which the roots and the trunks of the brachial plexus pass
- They are innervated via the mostly the cervical and a bit of the brachial plexi (C4 – C8)

![Scalene-Muscles-of-the-Neck.jpg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Scalene-Muscles-of-the-Neck.jpg)

### Strap/Infrahyoid Muscles

- These are seen as slender strips inferior to the Hyoid, deep to the Investing Deep Fascia and SCM but Anterior/Superficial to the Laryngeal Cartilage and Thyroid Gland
- They are found superficial to the Scaleni
- They lower the hyoid and larynx (during swallowing) or can fix the Hyoid when they act with Suprahyoid Muscles
- Fixation of the Hyoid Bone by the action of the Infrahyoid Muscles and the Muscles of the Mouth Floor produces a stable bony basis on which the tongue can move
- They all have an attachment below and from the hyoid
- They all have different insertion points
- The Thyrohyoid first elevates the Thyroid Cartilage towards the Hyoid, then the Sternothyoid depresses the Larynx.
- This rise and fall of the Larynx can be clearly seen in the neck during each swallow
- The Sternohyoid is found superficial to Thyrohyoid Superiorly and Sternothyroid Inferiorly
- The Sternohyoid is also found in the same plane as the Omohyoid but is medial to Omohyoid

**Innervation and Attachments:**

**Omohyoid** 

- Innervated by C1 – C3 via ansa cervicalis
- The Inferior Belly of Omohyoid originates from the Superior part of the Scapula and passes anteriorly over the root of the neck
- The Superior Belly originates from the Inferior Border of the Hyoid
- The Intermediate tendon passes through a fascial sling which is attached to the fascia on the deep surface of the SCM
- The Inferior Belly of omohyoid is posterior to the sternocleidomastoid
- This is found lateral to the Sternohyoid and like the other Infrahyoid Muscles, it depresses the Hyoid

**Sternohyoid** 

- Innervated by C1 – C3 via ansa cervicalis
- It originates from the posterior surface of the Manubrium and ascending to insert to the Hyoid superiorly

**Sternothyroid** 

- Innervated by C1 – C3 via ansa cervicalis
- This is found deep to Sternohyoid and is in continuity with the Thyrohyoid superiorly
- This originates from the Posterior Aspect of the Manubrium and travels superiorly to the Oblique Line on the Thyroid Cartilage

**Thyrohyoid**

- Innervated by C1 fibres (Thyrohyoid Nerve) that travel with CN XII but do not form the Ansa Cervicalis, running separately to innervate Thyrohyoid and Geniohyoid
- This connects the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid and is the superior continuation of the Sternothyroid
- This originates from the Oblique line of the Thyroid Cartilage and inserts onto the Inferior Border of the Hyoid
- This is found deep to the superior parts of the Omohyoid and the entirety of Sternohyoid (It is the Most Superior Infrahyoid Muscle)
- The sternohyoid, sternothyroid and thyrohyoid are fairly midline muscles

![f008-168-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f008-168-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Trapezius

- The lower fibres of the trapezius can move the neck
- The descending part (Vertical fibres projecting inferiorly which originate on the Skull) can rotate the head on the opposite side
- If you contract the left part of the trapezius, the head moves to the right
- It positions the scapula relative to the head and neck
- It is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve (XI) and C3 and C4 for its motor function and the cervical plexus for its sensory innervation

![trapezius_muscle.jpg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/trapezius_muscle.jpg)

![f002-045-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f002-045-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Sternocleidomastoid (SCM)

- This is an important muscle for locating structures in the neck
- This originates as a round tendon from the Anterior Surface of the Manubrium and the Medial 1/3rd of the Clavicle as a flat muscular sheet
- These two sets of fibres fuse as they ascend on their way to insert onto the Mastoid process of the Skull and lateral aspect of the Posterior Nuchal Line on the Posterior surface of the Occipital Bone, covering the anterior and lateral aspects of the neck
- It is quite strong and important for a lot of head movements
- It also assists breathing mechanics by lifting the sternum to increase thoracic volume
- If it is activated unilaterally, there is lateral bending of the neck to the same side and rotation of the neck/head to the opposite side
- If it is activated bilaterally, the head comes forward through neck flexion and head extension
- It is innervated by the spinal accessory nerve (XI) for its motor function and the cervical plexus for its sensory innervation

![f008-183-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f008-183-9780323393041.jpeg)

![suIZxIBsRiV22bQrV394bQ_Musculus_sternocleidomastoideus_01.jpg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/suIZxIBsRiV22bQrV394bQ_Musculus_sternocleidomastoideus_01.jpg)

### Styloid Muscles/Styloid Apparatus

- These pass through the branches of the Carotid Tree, from their common origin on the Styloid Process on the base of the Skull, on the deep aspect of the side of the neck
- These are the Styloglossus, Stylopharyngeus and Stylohyoid

**Styloglossus**

- This is an Extrinsic Muscle of the Tongue that passes through the Superior and Middle Pharyngeal Constrictors to reach its insertion
- It originates from the Styloid Process of the Temporal Bone, between the External and Internal Carotid Arteries, and runs anteroinferiorly to insert onto the Posterior Tongue
- It acts to pull the tongue superiorly and posteriorly, notably during swallowing and speech

**Stylopharyngeus**

- Stylopharyngeus passes with CN IX, proximally between the Internal and External Carotid Arteries and then anteriorly over the Upper Border of the Middle Constrictor to enter the Wall of the Pharynx
- It is a longitudinal Muscle of the Pharynx that passes deep to the other Styloid Muscles
- Once inside the Pharynx, it inserts onto the Internal Surface of the Thyroid Cartilage
- Its proximal association with CN IX means it can be used as a guide for the position of CN IX

**Stylohyoid**

- It originates from the Styloid Process of the Temporal Bone and runs along the Superior Border of the Posterior Belly of the Digastric
- This is the most superficial Styloid Muscle and runs around the Anterior Surface of the Carotid Tree (Like CN XII) to insert onto the Hyoid Bone, at the junction between the Body and the Greater Cornu/Horn
- At its insertion, its tendon splits, with the Intermediate Tendon of the Digastric Muscle passing through this split, through which it can glide and move.
- The Stylohyoid Ligament passes deep to the Stylohyoid and attaches to the Lesser Horn of the Hyoid, onto which part of the Middle Pharyngeal Constrictor Originates
- It acts to retract the Hyoid Bone/pull it posteriorly and elevate it

# Surface Anatomy of the Neck and Superficial Triangles

- The Anterior and Posterior Triangles are triangular-shaped 'windows' created between the SCM and Trapezius, covered by the Deep Investing Layer of Cervical Fascia

![Scannable Document on 10 Nov 2021 at 12_55_51 pm.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Scannable_Document_on_10_Nov_2021_at_12_55_51_pm.png)

### Posterior Triangle

- This is outlined by the Posterior Border of the Sternocleidomastoid anteriorly, middle 1/3rd of the Clavicle inferiorly (Base of the Triangle) and Anterior Border of the Trapezius posteriorly
- It contains the:
1. The spinal accessory nerve (XI) - This enters the deep aspect of SCM close to the mastoid Process and leaves its substance about 1/3rd of the Way down its posterior border
- CN XI then travels posteroinferiorly across the Posterior Triangle within the Deep Investing Fascia to enter and innervate the Trapezius about 1/3rd of the way down its posterior border
1. Lesser occipital nerve
2. Supraclavicular nerves
3. Superior trunk of
the brachial plexus
4. External jugular vein
- The external jugular vein is found on the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid

![f008-183-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f008-183-9780323393041%201.jpeg)

### Anterior Triangle

- This is bordered by the Anterior Border of the Sternocleidomastoid laterally, the Inferior Border of the Mandible superiorly (Base of the triangle) and the midline of the neck medially (The 2 Anterior Triangles are continuous with one another medially)
- This contains the contents of the anterior column of the neck

![f008-166-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f008-166-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Vasculature in the Neck

## Main Arterial Supply

- The main supply stems directly from the aorta from the internal and external carotid arteries
- The external carotid supplies everything on the outside of the skull and the neck

![f008-171-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f008-171-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Carotid Arteries

- The common carotid arises from the Brachiocephalic Trunk on the RHS and Aorta on the LHS
- They ascend in the neck, posterolateral to the Midline Trachea and Oesophagus before dividing into the internal (more posterior branch) and external (more anterior branch) arteries near the superior border of the thyroid cartilage (near the Angle of the Mandible).
- The Right Common Carotid branches from the Brachiocephalic Trunk just before ascending through the Superior Aperture of the Thorax

![f008-170-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f008-170-9780323393041.jpeg)

![Scannable Document on 8 Nov 2021 at 1_16_16 pm.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Scannable_Document_on_8_Nov_2021_at_1_16_16_pm.png)

**Internal Carotid**

- This continues upwards and enters the skull through the carotid canal without releasing any branches (it has no branches in the Neck)
- It supplies the cerebrum and meninges
- Initially, CN IX-XII are found quite close to the Internal Carotid Artery and Vein. However, as these nerves run down the neck, they spread out to reach their destinations and associate with branches of the Carotid Tree (From the ECA) to form Neurovascular Bundles

![ancirc.jpg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/ancirc.jpg)

**External Carotid**

- This ascends up the neck to supply the larynx, pharynx, mouth, nose and scalp and shares the supply to the thyroid glands (Most of the Head, Neck, Face and Scalp)
- These are supplied by anterior, medial, posterior and terminal branches
- The anterior branches are important for supply of the face
- The medial branch goes to the back of the mouth, pharynx and the Infratemporal Fossa
- The posterior branches supply the Occipital Bone and the posterior aspects of the scalp
- The terminal branches (Superior Temporal Branch) ascends to supply the mid-scalp and back of the head
- The Superior Thyroid Artery arises from Anterior Wall of the ECA just after it arises from the Bifurcation of the Common Carotid Artery, at the Upper Border of the Thyroid Cartilage
- The Ascending Pharyngeal Artery arises opposite the Superior Thyroid Artery, from the Posterior Wall of the External Carotid Artery, just after it arises from the Common Carotid Artery
- This supply the Pharyngeal Wall
- The Hyoid Bone is palpable just above the Thyroid Cartilage. At this level, the Lingual Artery arises to supply the tongue
- The Facial Artery arises just above the Lingual Artery, just posterior to the Angle of the Mandible from the Anterior Wall of the External Carotid Artery
- At this level, the Mandible covers the Carotid Tree so to reach the Facial Region, the Facial Artery has to loop under the Inferior Border of the Mandible, where it can be palpated
- The Occipital Artery arises opposite the Facial Artery, from the Posterior Wall of the ECA, just posterior to the Angle of the Mandible
- This runs posteriorly to the back of the neck, deep to SCM
- The ECA then ascends deep to the Mandible, piercing the Substance of the Parotid Gland
- Just proximal to the Terminal Bifurcation of the ECA, the Posterior Auricular Artery runs out of the Parotid Gland near the Neck of the Mandible to supply adjacent regions of the Parotid Gland as well as the Skin and Muscle Here
- Within the Parotid Gland, the remainder of the ECA bifurcates to form the Superficial Temporal Artery (Posterior Branch) and the Maxillary Artery (Anterior Branch)
- The Superficial Temporal Artery ascends along the Posterior Border of the Mandible to reach the superficial structures of the Temple and Scalp
- The Maxillary Artery passes anteromedially towards the Nose to supply the Upper Jaw, Back of the Nose and Superior Aspect of the Pharynx
- CN IX-XII and their branches run along branches of the Subclavian and External Carotid Arteries to form Neurovascular Bundles that supply the head and neck

### Carotid Sinus

- There are two clumps of nervous tissue found around the Bifurcation of the Common Carotid
1. One clump, usually referred to as the carotid sinus is:
- A dilation of the lower end of the internal carotid artery and is situated behind the bifurcation of the common carotid artery
- Sensitive to arterial blood pressure changes due to many baroreceptors being located here
1. This is a small patch of particular receptor tissue embedded into the wall of the blood vessel (Carotid Body)
- The carotid body functions as a chemoreceptor and a baroreceptor monitoring blood gases and blood pressure
- It is also called the glomus caroticum as is found in close vicinity to the carotid sinus and contains chemoreceptors
- These monitor O**₂**/CO₂ pressures, pH values and temperature of the arterial blood
- The main innervation to both the carotid sinus and body is derived from the carotid branches of the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX)
- The cervical sympathetic trunk and the vagus nerve also contribute
- There is therefore parasympathetic innervation from the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves and sympathetic innervation to these regions from the cervical sympathetic trunk

## Secondary Arterial Supply

- There is additional second line arterial supply and venous drainage via subclavian arteries/veins, which cross the root of the neck to supply the arms:
- This is via the vertebral arteries and thyrocervical trunk

![f008-191-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/f008-191-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Vertebral Arteries

- The vertebral arteries supply the cerebrum and meninges
- They are the first branch of the Subclavian arteries and run in the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae
- They enter into the skull via the foramen magnum

![The-course-of-the-vertebral-artery-92.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/The-course-of-the-vertebral-artery-92.png)

### Thyrocervical Trunk

- The Thyrocervical trunk has shared supply to the thyroid gland, scalene muscles and the Inferior parts of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscle (Superficial Muscles of the Neck) via its 4 main branches
- This trunk comes off the Subclavian Arteries, lateral to where the Vertebral Arteries arise (2nd Branch of the Subclavian Artery)
- This trunk gives blood vessels (Transverse Cervical Artery) to supply the Lateral Aspect of Trapezius on the Top of the shoulder, lower neck and shoulder
- The Inferior Thyroid Artery is the most important branch of the Thyrocervical Trunk and ascends to supply the Thyroid Gland - It is the continuation of the Trunk after it gives off the Suprascapular and Transverse Cervical Arteries, which project posteriorly to supply the Shoulder Region and Scapular Muscles

![070517_0505_SubclavianA12.jpg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/070517_0505_SubclavianA12.jpg)

### Costocervical Trunk

- This arises from the Subclavian Artery just distal where the Thyrocervical Trunk and Internal Thoracic Artery Arise
- This gives off the Deep Cervical Artery to supply the Deep Muscles in the Back of the Neck and the Superior Thoracic Artery that supplies 1st and 2nd Intercostal Space

# Venous Drainage

### Main Drainage

- The main drainage of the head and neck is to the superior vena cava via internal and external jugular veins
- The intracranial/meningeal sinuses are drained by the internal jugular vein
- The external jugular vein is responsible for the scalp drainage
    
    ![jugular-vein.jpg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/jugular-vein.jpg)
    

### Internal Jugular Vein

- It enters the neck via the Jugular Foramen, arising here as the Superior Jugular Bulb (Swollen region of the IJV)
- Initially, it runs lateral to the the Internal Carotid and then the Common Carotid Arteries as it descends towards the Neck
- As it descends, it receives superficial venous drainage from the scalp, face and neck as well as deep tributaries of the Neck
- As it descends, it runs anteriorly to pass towards and then posterior to the Sternoclavicular Joint, to lie between the 2 Heads of SCM
- At the root of the neck, the Internal Jugular and Subclavian Veins join to form the Brachiocephalic Vein, which fuse Posterolaterally to the Manubrium on the LHS to form the SVC
- Just proximal to the Confluence of the IJV and Subclavian Veins, the IJV Swells to form the Inferior Jugular Bulb
- There are valves just above the Inferior Jugular Bulb to prevent Backflow of Blood into the IJV when Intrathoracic Pressure is raised

### Surface Relations of the Internal/External Jugular Veins

- Whilst the External and Internal Carotid Arteries are of a similar size, the Internal Jugular Vein is much larger than the External Jugular Vein
- The sternocleidomastoid is a clinically important relation of the internal jugular vein
- At the base of the Skull, the Jugular Foramen is found anterior to the Arch of the Atlas, midway between the Mastoid Process and the Tragus of the Auricle when the face is turned to face laterally
- The EJV can usually be seen running superomedially across the Posterior Triangle when the Head is turned to the opposite side, crossing the Line between the Tragus and Heads of the Sternocleidomastoid at its midpoint
- The IJV is found along the line between the Midpoint of the Tragus of the Auricle and Mastoid Process (Where the Arch of the Atlas is found) and between the heads of the sternocleidomastoid/Sternoclavicular Joint (roughly halfway down this line)

# Superficial Veins in the Neck (D&P)

- Venous drainage from the lower facial region and the temple run inferiorly into the neck via the Retromandibular Vein (This originates just anterior to the Superior Tip of the Auricle and descends along its anterior border) and the Posterior Auricular Vein (Originates just posterior to the Auricle and descends along its posterior border)
- Deep to the Parotid Gland, the Retromandibular Vein divides into Anterior and Posterior Branches
- The Posterior Branch travels deep to join the Posterior Auricular Vein, inferior to the Lobule of the Auricle, to form the External Jugular Vein
- The External Jugular Vein descends inferolaterally through the Subcutaneous Tissue on the Anterior Surface of the SCM on the Lateral Aspect of the Neck and then Descends along the Lateral Border of the SCM within the Posterior Triangle
- When it reaches the Base of the Posterior Triangle, it pierces the Investing Layer of the Deep Cervical Fascia to drain into the Subclavian Vein
- The Anterior Branch of the Retromandibular Vein joins the Facial Vein at the Angle of the Mandible (Just inferior to the Parotid Gland)
- The Facial Vein then continues to run inferiorly, piercing the Cervical Fascia to drain into the Internal Jugular Vein, found deep to the Medial Border of SCM

![Scannable Document on 10 Nov 2021 at 1_59_26 pm.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Scannable_Document_on_10_Nov_2021_at_1_59_26_pm.png)

- The Anterior Jugular Veins drain the Floor of the Mouth and the Anterior Neck Superficially
- They run inferiorly, medial to SCM within the Anterior Triangle and pierce the Fascia of the Anterior Triangle just superior to the Manubrium to enter the Suprasternal Space.
- Here, the two veins are joined across the Midline by the Jugular Venous Arch
- After this venous anastomoses, the Anterior Jugular Veins bend and run laterally, deep to the SCM to join the External Jugular Vein after it has pierced the Investing Layer of the Deep Cervical Fascia

# Cervical Plexus

- The cervical plexus is normally found lateral to the common
carotid and internal jugular underneath the sternocleidomastoid
- The anterior/Ventral spinal nerve roots of C1 – C4 form the cervical plexus
- C1 – C3 form the ansa cervicalis of the cervical plexus

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 14.10.36.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_14.10.36.png)

### Hypoglossal Nerve

- The hypoglossal nerve (XII) is mostly a motor nerve
- It innervates the muscles of the tongue and is thus used in phonation
- On the way to the tongue, some fibres from Ventral Rami of C1 run/hitch-hike along it, running just inferior to it
- Some of these fibres go to form the Thyrohyoid Nerve to innervate the Thyrohyoid and Geniohyoid whilst other fibres from the Ventral Rami of C1 then diverge from CN XII near the Medial Border of the Bifurcation of the Common Carotid Artery (ECA) and run inferiorly (whilst CN XII loops superiorly) to form the Superior Root of the Hypoglossal Nerve
- This means that the hypoglossal nerve rides along the superior margin of the cervical plexus for a while
- The inferior root of ansa cervicalis is formed from the ventral rami of C2 and C3 and the superior root is formed from ventral rami of C1

![Scannable Document 2 on 8 Nov 2021 at 4_33_39 pm.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Scannable_Document_2_on_8_Nov_2021_at_4_33_39_pm.png)

- The Phrenic Nerve is formed primarily by the Ventral Ramus of C4, alongside some fibres from C3 and C5 (the latter from the Brachial Plexus) and so, it is formed partially from the cervical (C3-4) and partially with the brachial plexus (C5)
- The Phrenic Nerve then passes onto the Anterior Surface of the Anterior Scalene before running inferomedially across the Subclavian Artery and through the Superior Thoracic Aperture to enter the Thorax

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 14.18.34.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_14.18.34.png)

- The Superior and Inferior Roots of the Cervical Plexus join to form a U-Shaped Loop (Ansa Cervicalis) on the Anterior Surface of the Common Carotid Artery and Internal Jugular Vein

![Scannable Document on 8 Nov 2021 at 4_40_09 pm.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Scannable_Document_on_8_Nov_2021_at_4_40_09_pm.png)

- Nerves come off the ansa cervicalis to supply the strap/Infrahyoid muscles except Thyrohyoid
- Cutaneous sensory nerves such as the lesser and greater occipital, greater auricular, transverse cervical and supraclavicular nerves also come off the Cervical Plexus (not the Ansa Cervicalis) and emerge from the Neck at the Posterior Border of the SCM to radiate medially, away from each other, just deep to the Skin
- From Superior to Inferior they are:
1. The Lesser Occipital Nerve (C2-C3) ascends along the Posterior border of the SCM to innervate the Back of the Ear and the Skin of the Scalp Behind the Ear
2. The Great Auricular Nerve (C3) ascends superomedially across the Anterior Surface of the SCM (Posterior to the Ear) to innervate the skin over the Anterior and Posterior Ear
3. The Transverse Cervical Nerve (C4) projects medially across the the Anterior Surface of the SCM to innervate the skin of the Anterior and Lateral Neck
4. The Supraclavicular Nerve (C3 and C4) descends along the Posterior Border of the SCM, over the Clavicle before branching into Medial, Intermediate and Lateral Supraclavicular Nerves to supply the front of the Chest
- The branches of the Supraclavicular Nerve can be palpated as they cross over the Clavicle

![Screenshot 2021-11-14 at 19.23.40.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Screenshot_2021-11-14_at_19.23.40.png)

- C2 is found on the Posterior Scalp, Ear and the Superior Region of the Neck (Just under Mandible)
- C3 is the Lower (Majority) aspect of the Neck
- C4 is the region just above and superficial to the Clavicle, where the Upper Limb joins the Trunk

![Screenshot 2021-11-14 at 19.24.03.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Screenshot_2021-11-14_at_19.24.03.png)

# Cervical Plexus Sensory Distribution

- C1 does not contribute to the body sensory innervation
- It is purely a motor nerve to the muscles of the tongue and some of the muscles of the vertebral column
- The branches of the cervical plexus reaching the body surface can be located in the posterior neck triangle when following the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid

![Screenshot 2021-10-28 at 14.23.13.png](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Screenshot_2021-10-28_at_14.23.13.png)

# Vagus (X) and Accessory (XI) Nerves

### Accessory Nerve

- The accessory nerve arises as spinal and cranial roots.
- The Spinal Portion of the Accessory Nerve arises from the cervical spinal cord whilst the Cranial Portion of CN XI arises just inferior to the Vagus Nerve
- The spinal portion ascends to enter the skull through the foramen magnum
- In the skull, it joins the cranial root of the accessory nerve which comes from the medulla oblongata (just inferior to the Vagus Nerve roots) and both roots converge on to join/mix with the Vagus Nerve within the Posterior Cranial Fossa, just proximal to the Jugular Foramen to travel through the Jugular Foramen together (alongside CN IX which runs as a separate nerve)
- Once CN X and XI have passed through the Jugular Foramen, these nerves separate again, with the Cranial Fibres of CN XI joining CN X whilst the Spinal Fibres of CN XI travel on as a separate nerve
- This means that the Vagus Nerve that enters the Thorax is a mixture of Vagoaccessory Fibres (CN X and Cranial CN XI Fibres) whilst CN XI in the neck is technically the Spinal Part of CN XI
- These Vagoaccessory Fibres descend through the Thorax to provides motor innervation to the Pharyngeal Muscles and Laryngeal Nerves on their descend through the Head and Neck
- The Motor Fibres from the Pharyngeal Branch of the Vagus, Some sensory fibres from CN IX and some SNS Fibres from the Superior Cervical Plexus form the Pharyngeal Plexus on the Pharyngeal Wall which provides motor and sensory innervation to the Pharynx and Motor Supply to the Muscles of the Soft Palate (except Tensor Palati)
- The Laryngeal Nerve contains a mixture of true vagal and cranial accessory fibres however, by the time the main Vagal Trunks have reached the Thorax, all the Cranial Accessory Fibres (alongside some true vagal fibres) have innervated the muscles of the Pharynx, Larynx and Soft Palate
- This means that the Vagus Nerve in the Thorax and Abdomen are true vagal fibres and not vagoaccessory fibres
- The spinal portion of the accessory nerve is motor to and passes posteroinferiorly to innervate the SCM and Trapezius

![Accessory-nerve-Distribution.jpg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/Accessory-nerve-Distribution.jpg)

### Vagus Nerve

- The Vagus nerve (Vagoaccessory) travels in the carotid sheath (closely associated with the Internal Carotid Artery, Common Carotid Artery and Internal Jugular Vein) on its way to the thorax after leaving the cranial cavity via the Jugular Foramen
- The Carotid Sheath is a large descending Neurovascular Bundle, comprised of the Internal Carotid Artery Proximally and Common Carotid Artery distally, Vagus Nerve and Internal Jugular Vein (Moving Laterally), surrounded by The Anterior Layer of the Deep Investing Cervical Fascia
- Soon after leaving the Cranial Cavity, it gives off a Pharyngeal Branch, which forms a meshwork on the surface of the Pharyngeal Muscles to carry Motor Fibres to the Pharynx and Palate

![image-6.webp](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/image-6.webp)

- The vagus nerve and cranial part of the accessory nerve therefore end up in the anterior larynx on the way to the thorax
- The vagus nerve forms part of the cardiac plexi and pulmonary plexi in the chest, along with gastric plexi in the abdomen
- It descends closely associated to the Internal and then Common Carotid Arteries before running anterior to the Subclavian Artery to leave the neck and enter the Thorax via the Superior Thoracic Aperture
- It has 2 main branches within the Neck, the Superior and Recurrent Laryngeal Nerves which innervate the Upper and Lower Boundaries of the Larynx
- The Superior Laryngeal Nerve divides to give a Sensory Branch (Internal Laryngeal Nerve) which enters the Larynx by piercing the Thyrohyoid Membrane and a Motor Branch (External Laryngeal Nerve) which innervates Cricothyroid
- Along part of its course, the Superior Laryngeal Nerve follows the Superior Thyroid Artery to form a Neurovascular Bundle
- The Right Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve arises just above the Right Subclavian Artery and descends over the anterior surface of the Right Subclavian Artery, looping under it to ascend Posterior to the Right Subclavian Artery
- The Left Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve arises inferior to the Right Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve, within the thorax vs the Neck
- The Left Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve descends across the Anterior Surface of the Aortic Arch, looping under it and ascending Posterior to it alongside the Inferior Thyroid Artery
- The Recurrent Laryngeal Nerves ascend posterior to their associated Arteries alongside the Inferior Thyroid Artery, Lateral to the Trachea and Posterior to the Thyroid Distally, to form a Neurovascular Bundle which supplies all the muscles of the Larynx except Cricothyroid

# Glossopharyngeal (IX) and Hypoglossal (XII) Nerves

### Hypoglossal Nerve

- The Hypoglossal Nerve mainly travels through the neck without innervating structures
- The hypoglossal nerve (XII) begins as the most Medially placed CN and comes out of the skull from the hypoglossal canal/anterior condylar foramen which is found in the occipital condyles
- The occipital condyles are where the skull connects with the atlas
- It travels anteroinferiorly in the shape of a wide arc, to travel around the anterior surface of the Internal and External Carotids, the Carotid Tree and anteroinferior to the Loop of the Lingual Artery.
- As it descends it runs along the Anterior Border of Stylopharyngeus, crossing under CN XI and over CN X in the Neck to run superoanteriorly to supply motor innervation to the tongue

![hypoglossal-Nerve-1.jpeg](%5B002%5D%20Superficial%20Structures%20in%20the%20Neck%206a1e3f7aec1546908813942e762699be/hypoglossal-Nerve-1.jpeg)

### Glossopharyngeal Nerve (CN IX)

- The glossopharyngeal (IX) nerve leaves the skull via the jugular foramen
- As it descends, it crosses over the Anterior Surface of the Internal Carotid Artery (Not within the Carotid Sheath) to end Medial/Deep to the External Carotid Artery
- The Superior Ganglion of the Glossopharyngeal Nerve (Contains sensory cell bodies) is found in close proximity to the jugular foramen
- It follows the styloid process anteriorly between the external and internal carotid
- When it reaches the upper border of the Middle Pharyngeal Constrictor, it provides sensory innervation to the pharynx
- After this, it runs just lateral to the Palatine tonsil in the wall of the Pharynx to supply the posterior 1/3rd of the Tongue
- As CN IX approaches the Bifurcation of the Common Carotid Artery, it gives off the Carotid Sinus Nerve (Small Nerve) which runs down to the Bifurcation of the Common Carotid Artery to supply the Carotid Body and Sinus
- It follows the stylopharyngeus muscle, crossing underneath the accessory and over the vagus nerve in the neck to reach the back of the tongue and the pharynx

# The Mandibular Division Trigeminal Nerve (CN V3) and Facial Nerve (CN VII)

- The Mandibular Nerve leaves the Cranial Cavity via the Foramen Ovale whilst the Facial Nerve exits the Cranial Cavity via the Stylomastoid Foramen
- The Mandibular Nerve then runs deep to the Mandible whilst the Facial Nerve runs superficial to the Mandible
- The Mandibular Nerve innervates structures in the mouth whilst the Facial Nerve innervates the Muscles of the Face

# Sympathetic Trunk in the Neck

- The Cervical Sympathetic Trunk extends from the base of the skull superiorly to the Superior Thoracic Opening where it is continuous with the Thoracic Sympathetic Trunk inferiorly
- These are coming off the fibres of the spinal nerve roots, but C1 does not supply many fibres to the sympathetic trunk
- The Sympathetic Trunks are located alongside the carotid sheaths, anterior to the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae
- It contains three ganglia:
1. The superior/upper cervical ganglion (C1–4)
2. The middle cervical ganglion (C5–C6)
3. The inferior/lower/thoraco-cervical/stellate ganglion (C7–T1)
- The Thoracocervical Ganglion is just behind the clavicle, on the neck of Rib 1, and is often formed by the Fusion of the Inferior Ganglion and the First Thoracic Ganglion
- It is a very important ganglion as it lies in close vicinity to lots of structures and it can be quite compressed when the individual has issues with lymphadenopathy
- This can result in issues with sympathetic outflow when there is something wrong in the chest
- Postganglionic SNS Fibres arise in all 3 ganglia and many of them ascend along blood vessels to reach their destination in the Head and Neck
- SNS Fibres from the Superior Cervical Ganglion climb alongside the Internal and External Carotids
- SNS FIbres from the Middle Cervical Ganglion climb alongside the Middle Thyroid Arteries
- SNS Fibres from the Inferior/Thoracocervical Ganglion climb alongside the Vertebral Arteries
- A small branch of the Middle Cervical Ganglion loops under the Subclavian an Ascends to rejoin the Thoracocervical Ganglion (Ansa Subclavia) - This gives some SNS Fibres to the Subclavian Artery destined for the upper limb
- Sympathetic innervation to the head results in:
1. Dilation of the pupil
2. Relaxed ciliary muscle
3. Reduced secretion of salivary glands
4. Reduced secretion of lacrimal glands
5. Increases secretion from sweat glands
6. Constricted blood vessels
- Parasympathetic supply of head and neck is provided by cranial nerves

# Lymph Nodes of the Neck

- Head and neck lymphatics are to be considered as a combined system
- The General pattern seen is that superficial lymph vessels of both the head and neck to drain to superficial cervical nodes
- Superficial Cervical Nodes then drain to a Deep Cervical Nodes which are found underneath the sternocleidomastoid clustering around the internal jugular vein and Carotid Sheath along their length
- Some more superficial structures of the Head and Neck drain directly to deep cervical nodes instead of draining to Superficial Nodes first
- Deep cervical nodes drain to lymphatic duct and thoracic duct

### Superficial Cervical Nodes

- They are arranged in a ring-shape around the base of the neck/inferior aspect of the head
- They mostly receive lymph from the scalp and face and often follow the distribution
of the arterial blood supply
- There are 5 groups discerned (posterior to anterior) and each can have subgroupings:
1. Occipital nodes (near occipital artery from the ECA) - These are found near the Base of the Occipital Bone posteriorly (at the lateral border of Trapezius)
- They drain the Occipital Region of the Scalp and the muscles on the Posterior Head and Neck
1. Mastoid nodes, including posterior auricular nodes (near auricular artery)
2. These are found posterior to the Ear on the Mastoid Process of the Temporal Bone. 
- These also drain the Posterior Neck, Ear and regions of the Scalp
1. Parotid and/or preauricular nodes (near superficial temporal artery)
- These are located anterior to the Auricle of the Ear
- They drain the Superficial Areas of the Face and the Temporal Nodes
1. Submandibular nodes (near facial artery)
- These found inferior to the Mandibular Body, at roughly its midpoint
- This drains the Lips, Tongue, Cheeks and Lateral Nose
1. Submental nodes (near facial artery)
- These are found superficial to the Mylohyoid, just inferior to the Chin/Mandibular Symphysis
- These drain the Floor of the Mouth, Tongue Apex and Central Lower Lip
- For the Occipital and Mastoid Nodes, they drain to Superficial Cervical Nodes that follow the External Jugular Veins whilst the Parotid/Preauricular, Submandibular and Submental Nodes drain directly into Deep Cervical Nodes

### Deep Cervical Nodes

- These Deep Nodes are found  as a connected chain of nodes lying along the Vascular Pathways of the Neck, notably surrounding the Internal Jugular Vein and Carotid Sheath, beneath the Sternocleidomastoid
- They are labelled as Upper vs Lower in relation to their position relative to the Omohyoid Muscle
- There are 4 groups of Regional Deep Lymph Nodes in the Neck that are associated with the Internal Jugular Vein:
1. Posterior - Posterior to the Internal Jugular Vein
2. Anterior - Anterior to the Internal Jugular Vein
3. Superior - Upper Members of the Posterior and Anterior Groups
4. Inferior - Lower Members of the Posterior and Anterior Groups
- The Jugulodigastric Node is the most superior of the Deep Nodes and is found in the Angle between the Digastric Muscle superiorly and the Internal Jugular Vein posteriorly - This is a large node drains the Palatine Tonsil, Tonsillar Bed and posterior aspect of the Tongue (Posterior Mouth) and can become painful and inflamed in Tonsillitis
- It is a member of the Anterosuperior Group of Deep Cervical Nodes
- The Jugulo-omohyoid Node is found in the Posteroinferior Group of Deep Cervical Nodes, Found at the Posterior Angle of where the Posterior Belly of the Omohyoid crosses the Internal Jugular Vein (Boundary of Upper and Lower Nodes)
- This is a large node that drains the tongue
- All Lymph from the Head and Neck is eventually drained via this chain of deep nodes

- The Supraclavicular nodes are Lower Nodes found just below the Jugulo-Omohyoid Node also receive some lymph from the upper limb and the trunk/thorax on the way to the great veins of the neck.
- This is clinically significant as Breast Cancer which has metastasised to the Supraclavicular nodes, it has already invaded the Thoracic Cavity via the Internal Thoracic Nodes
- Sometimes, Gastric Carcinoma can also metastasise to the Supraclavicular Nodes
- Therefore, metastasis to the Supraclavicular Nodes often indicate wide metastasis (except for Cancers of the Lung Apices like Pancoast Tumour)
- They are the top/proximal end of the axillary chain of nodes and are sometimes known as the Anteroinferior Regional Group of Deep Cervical Nodes
- The inlet of the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct is around this area
- The Thoracic Duct ascends posterior to the Oesophagus, against the Internal Surface of the Preverterbral Fascia
- In advanced conditions, chest issues may be conveyed through the nodes here
- There are also issues from the head and neck that can spread down to the axilla

# Lymphadenopathy and Branchial Cysts

- Enlarged lymph nodes can be due to tonsillitis, TB, carcinoma and a whole host of other issues
- They usually produce solid, lateral one-sided or symmetric neck swellings
- Branchial cysts and fistulae are also located in the lateral neck and usually present as fluctuant, one-sided swellings
- Branchial cysts occur when branchial clefts do not obliterate or when branchial arches do not fuse properly
- Cysts then develop along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid
