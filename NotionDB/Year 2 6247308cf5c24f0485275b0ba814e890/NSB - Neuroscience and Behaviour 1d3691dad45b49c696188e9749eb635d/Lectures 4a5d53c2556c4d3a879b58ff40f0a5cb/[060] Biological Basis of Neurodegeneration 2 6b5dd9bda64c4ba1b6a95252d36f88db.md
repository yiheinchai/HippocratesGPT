### Statistics

- 1% of population > 60 years old, 10% of population > 65 years old and 50% population > 85 years of age.
- 2-3% have onset before 65 (Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease), 97-98% have onset after years of age (Later Onset Alzheimer's Disease).
- Age is greatest risk factor for AD. +ve family history is 2nd greatest risk factor.
- Genetic factors are hypervariable and estimated to account or 30-70% of risk.
- 10-15% have a family history consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.

### Symptoms

- Insidious loss of memory, orientation reasoning and other cognitive functions.
- Dementia characteristically progresses over 5-20 years.
- Generalised cortical atrophy with prominent changes in hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala, cerebral association cortices (E.g Parietal Lobe) and selected subcortical nuclei (Locus Cereleus and Nucleus Basalis of Meynert).
- This is characterised macroscopically as Small Hippocampus, Enlarged Ventricles and Shrunken/Degenerated Cortex

### Pathology

- Extracellular senile plaques are round or spherical structures (15- 25 ùúáùëö in diameter) consisting of a peripheral rim of abnormal neuronal processes (neurites) and processes of glial cells surrounding a core of amyloid protein composed of 6-10 nm fibrils.
- They may be subdivided into ‚Äòdiffuse‚Äô or ‚Äòpre-amyloid‚Äô and ‚Äòclassic‚Äô or ‚Äòneuritic‚Äô plaque.
- Neurofibrillary pathology: neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads and dystrophic neurites of neuritic plaques.
- These are all intracellular accumulations of paired helical filaments, basic component of which is hyperphosphorylated ùúè protein.
- PHF are 20 nm twisted fibrils.

### Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP)

- Genetic cause of autosomal dominant familial AD:
1. Mutations of APP on the long arm of Chromosome 21, which lead to inappropriate processing of APP.
2. Mutations may also be found in Presenilin 1 (hChr14) and Presenilin 2 (hChr1). 
- Presenilin 1 and 2 are the active subunits of a larger macromolecular complex that contains Gamma-Secretase activity, which cleaves the APP gene to leave a short C Terminal Fragment (Beta Amyloid) which deposits to form Extracellular Plaques
1. Trisomomy 21/Down Syndrome (extra copy of region of hCh21 or the entire chromosome) is associated with development of AD pathology after 30 years. 
- Will develop Alzheimer‚Äôs like pathology if copied region includes APP region on hCh21.
- ‚Üë expression (e.g via gene duplication) of APP is associated with the development of AD.
- Any mutation which leads to over-expression of APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) leads to an increased formation of beta amyloid, which forms Extracellular Plaques and hence, is implicated in the development of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease
- Major risk factor for AD is inheritance of  Apolipoprotein ùúñ4 allele (hChr19).
- ùõΩ-amyloid is C terminal region of APP. APP is progressively cleaved in brain, and portion found in plaques is AùõΩ region/Beta Amyloid (cleaved from APP) which forms beta amyloid.
- Recent Studies have suggested that the pathology associated with Intracellular Tau Neurofibrillary Tangles is more closely associated with the Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Decline seen in Alzheimer‚Äôs than Beta-Amyloid Plaques
- It has been therefore suggests that Beta-Amyloid Plaques trigger the Tau Pathology, which is the main mediator of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease

### Tau Tangles

- Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis - Missense mutations in APP, Presenilin 1 and 2 lead to the increased production and accumulation of Beta-Amyloid 42 which increases Beta-Amyloid 42:Beta-Amyloid 40, which leads to the development of Alzheimer‚Äôs
- Microtubular-Associated Protein Tau becomes Hyperphosphorylated, which associated to form Helical Dimers to form the Neurofibillary Tangles
- Tau is normally found as a Single Gene on Chromosome 17, undergoing a complicated slicing mechanism where 13 exons form 6 different Isoforms of the Tau Protein, with 3 of these containing R1-R4 and the other 3 Having R1,R3 and R4
- R1-R4 are the Microtubule Binding Domains which form the core of the Neurofibrillary Tau Tangle
- Within the Paired Helical Filament seen to form the Neurofibrillary Tau Tangle, all 6 Tau Isoforms are present, but these are Hyperphosphorylated at random locations along the protein, causing them to migrate different in Electrophoresis which allows for these Tangles to be identified
- These Tau Tangles are also found contributing to the pathology in a wide range of Neurodegenerative Conditions
- In Alzheimer‚Äôs, the Pathology of Tau Tangle Formation originates in the Entorhinal Cortex and other Hippocampal Associated Structures in the Medial Temporal Lobe
- In the Entorhinal Cortex, these Neurofibrillary Tangles are often clustered within Layers II and III of the Entorhinal Cortex, that excites the Hippocampal Formation via the Perforant Pathway

### Alipoprotein E

- This is an Alpha-Helical Protein with 2 Polymorphic Regions (158 = Cys or Arg and 112 = Cys or Arg)
- This polymorphisms produced ApoE1-4
- In Normal Individuals, The ApoE4 Allele is very rare but in Px with Alzheimer‚Äôs ApoE4 is found in highly expressed (Notably in E2:E4 Mutation Combination)
- Many individuals with Presenilin 1 Mutation have Familial Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease that reliably presents with Early Onset Mild Cognitive Impairment and Mild Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease by Mid-Late 40s
- An Individual containing this Presenilin 1 Mutation also had an APOE3 Christchurch Mutation which drastically delayed her onset of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (Not Mild Cognitive Impairment) until Late 70s
- This is because the APOE3 mutation made her ApoE3 become functionally similar to ApoE2, which led to a Drastic Increase in Beta Amyloid Deposition but a drastically reduced [Tau], which prevented Beta Amyloid from triggering the Formation of Tau Neurofibrillary Tangles, preventing Hippocampal Degeneration and the development of Alzheimer‚Äôs
- This means that expression of ApoE2 is protective against Alzheimer‚Äôs by preventing Tau Deposition and the formation of Neurofibrillary Tangles but without affecting Beta Amyloid Deposition

# Role of Tau Protein in Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease

- Tau Deposition and Neurofibrillary Tangle Formation (Involved in Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease and other Neurodegenerative Conditions) can be stimulated by Beta Amyloid (In Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease), Prions, Mild, Non-Concussive Head Injury (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy) and Alpha Synuclein (Dementia with Lewy Bodies)
- Different Diseases involving Tau Pathology are characterised by different conformational arrangements of the R1-R4 Microtubular Binding Regions (Conformers), found at the Core of the Neurofibrillary Tangle, to form the Tangle
- In Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, Hyperphosphorylated Tau forming Neurofibrillary Tangles can be seen in regions of the Frontal Cortex (Notably Deep in the Sulci), without the presence of Beta Amyloid

# Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Pathology and Patient HM

### Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Pathology

- Ligands that can bind to ùõΩ-amyloid or neurofibrillary tangles can be used for in vivo imaging via PET Scans to track the progression of the Neurofibrillary Tau Tangles and Beta Amyloid Plaque Formation seen in the development of Alzheimer‚Äôs

### Henry Gustav Molaison (Patient HM  - Not Important)

- Accident on bike at 9 may have triggered epilepsy, that progressed to extent of at least 1 seizure a day.
- Despite heavy medication, seizures continued.
- Neurosurgeon resected medial temporal lobe bilaterally.
- Surgery was successful for epilepsy, however, was unable to form new memories for rest of life from day of surgery.
- Early life event memories were retained. Memory broke down closer to day of surgery.
- Suggested that regions of brain destroyed are important in formation of memory, not storage.
- In Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, memory impairment is retrograde.
- There is good memory for childhood events, and recent memories are lost first.

# Braak's Staging of Alzheimer's Disease

- Braak‚Äôs staging classified degree of pathology.
1. Stage I and II: neurofibrillary tangle involvement.
2. Stage III and IV: limbic regions (i.e. hippocampus).
3. Stage V and VI: Neocortical involvement.
