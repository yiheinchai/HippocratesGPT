# [048] Vision - The Eye

# Image Formation - Refraction

### Refraction

- Refraction: bending of light rays.
- Occurs when light passes from a transparent medium (e.g. air - lower density) to another (e.g. cornea - higher density) of a different density.
- If light passes from one medium to another, both of the same density, no refraction will occur
- As light passes from an optically less dense medium to a denser medium, it bends towards the normal (line perpendicular to the border between the Media)
- The cornea performs 70% of the refraction required
- The unaccommodated lens also refracts light rays to produce a sharp image by performing the last 30% of refraction
- This amount of combined refraction is sufficient if the image is a long distance from the eye, when the light rays will be parallel to produce a sharp image.
- Closer images e.g. reading a book require a greater refractive power to bring them into focus on the retina (converge light rays on the retina).
- This focusing is brought about by the
lens accommodating (as we cannot change the Refractive Power of the Cornea), becoming wider/rounder and hence, having a greater refractive power.

### Refraction by the Cornea

- As light passes through cornea:
- As the Cornea is optically denser than the air, the Cornea Refracts the light and causes them to bend towards the line that is perpendicular to the border between the media (Normal)
- The Cornea refracts light onto the lens
1. As the Cornea is curved/convex, the Various Light rays refract at different degrees (as the Angle of Incidence changes along the Corneal Surface) and hence, bend to converge on back of eye.
- As light rays move away from the Coronal Plane through the Middle of the Cornea, the Angle of Incidence of the Light Ray increases, causing the Angle of Refraction to increase
1. Light rays that enter centre of eye pass straight to retina.
2. Cornea cannot change its refractive power as it cannot change its optical density or shape/curvature. This means it cannot accommodate.

### Refraction by the Lens

- The lens is an example of a Converging Lens, where Refracted Light Rays converge on a focal point found behind the lens
- If the Light Rays propagate outwards towards the lens from a common focal point, they are refracted by the lens in such a way that the Refracted Rays travel parallel to one another as they propagate behind the lens
- Any light rays that propagate through the Centre of the Lens are not refracted at all and emerge from the Lens at the same angle to that which they entered the lens
- As the lens can change shape via Accommodation, it can change its Refractive Power and hence, the position of the Focal Point, allowing for the production of a sharp image

# Lens Accommodation and Visual Correction

- Accommodation of the Lens allows an individual to view nearby objects
- For distance vision, the lens is thin and elongated but for near vision, the lens is wider/rounder
- The wider/rounder lens increases the refractive power of the Lens to increase the degree of refraction for light rays reflecting off nearby objects so that these rays can converge on the Focal Point
- In Distance Vision, Parallel Light Rays are refracted to converge onto a focal point on the Retina
- In Close Vision, Light Rays radiate outwards from a Focal Point (Light Rays reflecting from a nearby object) and are significantly refracted by the Cornea and Lens (more significantly) onto the Retina

![Screenshot 2021-12-11 at 14.17.45.png](%5B048%5D%20Vision%20-%20The%20Eye%20e55b9e7686a542fd8d502788a824142b/Screenshot_2021-12-11_at_14.17.45.png)

### Lens Accommodation by the Ciliary Muscles

- Contraction of the ciliary muscles reduces the tension on the zonule fibres, relaxing them and allowing the lens to become rounder (its resting state) due to its natural elasticity.

![Screenshot 2021-12-11 at 14.21.27.png](%5B048%5D%20Vision%20-%20The%20Eye%20e55b9e7686a542fd8d502788a824142b/Screenshot_2021-12-11_at_14.21.27.png)

## Visual Correction with Lenses

### Emmetropic (Normal) Eye

- Focuses parallel light rays on retina without need for accommodation for distant objects and via accommodation for close objects.

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 11.27.25.png](%5B048%5D%20Vision%20-%20The%20Eye%20e55b9e7686a542fd8d502788a824142b/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_11.27.25.png)

### Hyperopia (Farsightedness) Eye

- When eyeball is too short, light rays are focused at some point behind retina.
- Retina therefore sees a blurry image as light rays are not convergent at a single point on the Retina (Light Rays hit a wider area of the retina).
- Accommodation of lens is needed for distant objects to increase the Refraction of the Light Rays to move the focal point more anteriorly so that it lies on the Retina
- Near objects cannot be brought into focus as the lens is maximally accommodated during far vision and hence when viewing closing images, the lens cannot be accommodated further to increase the Refraction of Light Rays to bring the Focal Point further anterior onto the Retina.
- Convex lens is placed in front of eye to increase the refractive power of the eye (Rays are partially refracted as they hit the Cornea), producing the necessary refraction to move the Focal Point more anteriorly so that it lies on the retina, to allow near objects to be brought into focus.

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 11.30.22.png](%5B048%5D%20Vision%20-%20The%20Eye%20e55b9e7686a542fd8d502788a824142b/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_11.30.22.png)

### Myopia (Shortsightedness) Eye

- When eyeball is too long, parallel light rays from distant objects converge at some point before/anterior to the retina. Retina therefore sees an unfocussed, blurry image as light rays are not convergent at a single point on the Retina (Light Rays hit a wider area of the retina).
- Concave lens placed in front of eye to refract the light rays outwards away from the Normal line
- This provides the necessary refraction to move the Focal Point more posteriorly so that it lies on the Retina, allowing distant objects to be brought into focus on retinal surface.
- Photorefractive keratectomy (corrective laser surgery): uses a laser to reshape cornea and permanently ↑ or ↓ amount of refraction possible by altering its refractive power.

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 11.30.50.png](%5B048%5D%20Vision%20-%20The%20Eye%20e55b9e7686a542fd8d502788a824142b/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_11.30.50.png)

### Presbyopia

- Develops around age 40- 50.
- Elasticity of lens ↓.
- Lens fails to change shape (relax to its widened/rounded natural form) sufficiently during accommodation to allow for focused vision of nearby objects.
- This failure of accommodation means that when viewing nearby objects, the focal point is found posterior to the Retina, producing a blurry image on the Retina
- This often presents as a problem is a ↓ ability to read, requiring convex reading glasses.

# Ophthalmoscopic View of the Retina

- Macula - ‘central’ vision
- Fovea - central/thinner region of retina
- Optic disc - origin of blood vessels; where optic nerve axons exit eye (blind spot)
- The anatomical macula also called perifovea (~5.5 mm in diameter) is larger than the clinical macula (~ 1.5 mm in diameter) which is near the anatomical macula’s centre.
- The clinical macula is equivalent to the anatomical fovea.
- The foveola (~0.35 mm in diameter ) sits in the centre of the fovea.

# Retina

- Arranged into laminae consisting of:
1. Nuclear layers (cell bodies): cells are often organised into cell specific arrays (mosaics) to tile retina.
2. Plexiform layers (dendrites).
- Cell types: photoreceptors, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, ganglion cells.

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 11.35.13.png](%5B048%5D%20Vision%20-%20The%20Eye%20e55b9e7686a542fd8d502788a824142b/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_11.35.13.png)

- Horizontal, bipolar, amacrine and ganglion cells do preprocessing of information before sending visual information through optic nerve to brain.
- Each photoreceptor forms synaptic connections with bipolar cells and horizontal cells.
1. Bipolar cells: create a direct pathway from photoreceptors distally to ganglion cells proximally.
2. Horizontal cells: These have horizontal processes that form synaptic connections with cells found lateral to it in outer plexiform layer, to influence neighbouring cells.
- Amacrine cells also have horizontal processes that form synaptic connects with cells found lateral to it but are found in the Inner Plexiform
- Ganglion cells: only cell to produce action potential. All other cell types produce graded potentials.
- Light enters the Retina closest to the Ganglion Cells, travels distally through the Entire Retina until it reaches the Outer Layer of the Retina, where Photoreceptors are found and produce a Graded Potential that travels proximally through the Retina to reach the Ganglion Cells

# Photoreceptors

- Cones: colour system (mainly active in daylight). Short, tapering outer segment with few membranous discs.
- Rods: no colour sensitivity (sensitive to low light levels). Long cylindrical outer segments with many discs.
- Rods appear paler and thinner than Cones
- Retinitis Pigmentosa is the loss of rods followed by the progressive loss of cones, leading to night blindness and the loss of peripheral vision
- Age-Related Macular Degeneration is characterised by cone degeneration in the fovea, leading to a loss of central vision
- Transduction occurs in outer segments.
- They contain stacks of membranous discs containing light sensitive photopigments.
- Photoreceptors transduce light energy into changes in membrane
potential.
- This Leads to the closure of Na⁺ channels within the Photoreceptors and hyperpolarisation (When no light is hitting the retina, there is a 'Dark Current' that is continuously passing through the Retina).
- When activated and hyperpolarised, photoreceptors release less glutamate.

| Rods | Cones |
| --- | --- |
| High Light Sensitivity (Specialised for Night Vision) | Lower Light Sensitivity (Specialised for Light Vision) |
| More Photopigment and hence, captures more light | Less Photopigment and hence, captures less light |
| High Amplification | Low Amplification |
| Low Temporal Resolution (Slower Response) | High Temporal Resolution (Faster Response) |
| More Sensitive to Scattered Light | More Sensitive to Direct Light Rays |

| Rod System | Cone System |
| --- | --- |
| Low Acuity - Not Present in the Fovea, with a Highly Convergent Pathway | High Acuity - Concentrated in the Fovea, with a Dispersed Pathway |
| Achromatic (One Type of Rod Pigment) | Trichromatic (Three types of Cone Pigment, each with a different wavelength preference) |

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 11.38.19.png](%5B048%5D%20Vision%20-%20The%20Eye%20e55b9e7686a542fd8d502788a824142b/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_11.38.19.png)

- Rods are mainly sensitive (produce maximum response) to wavelengths of light corresponding to Green light
- Different Cones are tuned to be sensitive (produce maximum response) to different wavelengths of light corresponding to different colours of light, but the tuning/wavelength sensitivity curves for the cones all overlap
- The presence of different cones with different colour sensitivities produces a colour discrimination system in vision

# Fovea and Periphery

### Fovea

- Cones are Sparse in the Periphery but found in high numbers/concentrated in the Fovea whereas Rods are concentrated/found in high numbers in the Periphery but sparse in the Fovea
- Area of ↑ cell density specialised for high resolution vision (1 photoreceptor:1 bipolar cell) but poor light sensitivity as this is where cones are focused.
- Cell density changes decreases 1,000-fold moving from the Centre to the Periphery.
- It contain mostly cones (red and green, not blue).
- Whole retina cannot maintain this cell density and resolution

### Periphery

- Rods dominate in peripheral retina (optimises vision in dim light but impaired resolution of image produced here).
- Many photoreceptors: 1 bipolar cell.

# Bipolar Cells

- These are found just proximal to Photoreceptors

### Centre-Surround Organisation

- Each bipolar cell receives input from > 1
photoreceptor (i.e. rod or cone), except for in the Fovea where Bipolar Cells receive input from 1 photoreceptor (Cone)
- Receptive field (RF) is area of retina that alters Bipolar Cell Vm in response to light (Retina contains multiple RFs) .
- The Photoreceptors in the Centre of the Receptive Field makes direct synaptic connections with bipolar cell.
- The Peripheral/Surrounding Aspects of the Retina make indirect contact with bipolar cell via horizontal cells, which then synapse on the Bipolar Cell.
- This arrangement with differing connections between Photoreceptors and Bipolar Cells is referred to as a centre-surround RF
- The Bipolar Cell corresponding to a RF is found proximal to the Centre of the RF

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 11.46.14.png](%5B048%5D%20Vision%20-%20The%20Eye%20e55b9e7686a542fd8d502788a824142b/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_11.46.14.png)

# On and Off Cells and their Pathways

- Bipolar cells and horizontal cells receive glutamate and depending on receptors, they express (mGluR6 in On Centre Bipolar Cells, and AMPA or Kainate in Off Centre Bipolar Cells), they will become hyperpolarised or Depolarised in response to Glutamate respectively
- As the On Centre Bipolar Cell expresses mGluR6, the Cone:On Centre Glutamategic Synapse is inhibitory whereas the Off Centre Bipolar Cell expresses AMPA/Kainate Receptors and hence, the Cone:Off Centre Glutamatergic Synapse is Excitatory.
- On and Off Centre Bipolar Cells are then connected to On or Off Centre Ganglion Cells, releasing Glutamate onto Ganglion Cells to stimulate AMPA/Kainate/NMDA Receptors to trigger depolarisation
- This means that when Light Hits the Retina, Photoreceptors become hyperpolarised and release less Glutamate
- This means there is reduced Inhibition of the On-Centre Bipolar Cell and reduced excitation of the Off-Centre Bipolar Cell
- This means that the On Centre Bipolar Cell is depolarised and releases more glutamate on On Centre Ganglion Cells, causing them to depolarise and generate an AP/fire more frequently
- The Off Centre Bipolar Cell becomes hyperpolarised and releases less Glutamate on Off-Centre Ganglion Cells, causing them to hyperpolarise and not fire/fire less frequently
- Horizontal cells are depolarised by glutamate, meaning that reduced Glutamate release from Hyperpolarised Photoreceptors in response to light causes them to become Hyperpolarised by light.

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 11.48.28.png](%5B048%5D%20Vision%20-%20The%20Eye%20e55b9e7686a542fd8d502788a824142b/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_11.48.28.png)

### On-Centre Bipolar Cell - Direct Pathway

- When centre is illuminated:
1. The photoreceptor in centre/Centre Cone is hyperpolarised.
2. This causes reduced release of Glutamate by the Centre Cone onto the On Centre Bipolar Cell
3. mGluR6 receptor on On-Centre bipolar cell surface is less stimulated, reducing On-Centre Bipolar Cell inhibition which allows Na⁺ channels to open, causing depolarisation of Bipolar cell.
4. This causes the Depolarised On-Centre Bipolar Cell to release more Glutamate on the On Centre Ganglion Cell, causing it to depolarise and generate an AP

**Focusing on a Dark Centre**

- When the Centre is Dark:
1. Photoreceptor/Centre Cone is depolarised
2. This causes increased release of Glutamate by the Centre Cone onto the On and Off Centre Bipolar Cell
3. mGluR6 receptor on On-Centre bipolar cell surface is more stimulated, increasing On-Centre Bipolar Cell inhibition which closes Na⁺ channels, causing hyperlarisation of Bipolar cell.
4. This causes the Hyperpolarised On-Centre Bipolar Cell to release less Glutamate on the On Centre Ganglion Cell, causing it to hyperpolarise and fire less frequently
5. AMPA/Kainate receptor on Off-Centre bipolar cell surface is more stimulated, increasing Off-Centre Bipolar Cell excitation which allows Na⁺ channels to open, causing depolarisation of Bipolar cell.
6. This causes the Depolarised Off-Centre Bipolar Cell to release more Glutamate on the Off Centre Ganglion Cell, causing it to depolarise and fire more frequently

### On-Centre Bipolar Cell Indirect Pathway - NYC

**Focusing on a Dark Centre**

1. Light in surround, dark in centre.
2. Photoreceptor in centre depolarised.
3. ↑ glutamate released from centre photoreceptor.
4. mGluR6 on On-bipolar cell surface are more active, closing Na⁺ channel, causing hyperpolarisation of bipolar cell.

**Focusing on a Light Centre**

1. Light in surround.
2. Photoreceptors in surround hyperpolarised
3. ↓ glutamate released from surround photoreceptors.
4. Horizontal cells receive more inputs from surround than centre.
5. ↓ glutamate makes horizontal cell hyperpolarised.
6. Hyperpolarisation of horizontal cells depolarises central photoreceptor (mechanism not clear), producing more bipolar hyperpolarisation.

# Ganglion Cells

- These receive input from bipolar cells and amacrine cells.
- Their axons form optic nerve and project to LGN.

### Ganglion Cell Classification

**Magnocellular Ganglion Cells (M-type)**

- These are responsible for Scotopic Vision (Vision under low light) and Motion Detection, aided by their large size (Largest Ganglion Cell)
- They are non-colour selective and have a large RF
- They comprise around 5% of the Ganglion Cell Population

**Parvocellular Ganglion Cells (P-type)**

- These comprise 90% of the Ganglion Cell Population
- They are colour selective (aided by their small size) and colour opponent cells ****
- They produce a sustained response
- They have a Small RF

**K Ganglion Cells (non-M, non-P type)**

- Intermediate Cell type between M and P Type Ganglion Cells
- They are have an intermediate sized RF and are Colour Selective
- They comprise around 5% of the Ganglion Cell Population

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 11.57.20.png](%5B048%5D%20Vision%20-%20The%20Eye%20e55b9e7686a542fd8d502788a824142b/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_11.57.20.png)

### Ganglion Cell Receptive Fields

- As Ganglion Cells have dendritic trees, this allows them to form multiple contacts with Bipolar Cells and hence, Photoreceptors, causing Ganglion Cells to have Receptor Fields
- Ganglion Cells have antagonistic centre-surround RFs, comprised of on and off Centre Fields which respond differently to light
- This allows for sensitive/optimal encoding of differences in illumination across the RF.
- On-centre and off-centre ganglion cell subtypes:
1. On-centre: depolarise in light, hyperpolarise in dark.
2. Off-centre: hyperpolarise in light, depolarise in dark.
- If there is diffuse illumination of a Receptive Field, there is equal activation of On and Off Centre Ganglion Cells, producing a constant firing rate (same as resting firing rate) from the RF
- If there is Central Illumination of the Centre RF, there is only activation of On Centre Bipolar Cells, causing Ganglion Cell Firing Rate to increase.
- When the Central Illumination is removed, there is a minor decrease in Ganglion Cell Firing Rate
- If there is Annular Illumination of the Surround RF, there is only activation of Off Centre Bipolar Cells, causing Ganglion Cell Firing Rate to decrease
- When the Annular Illumination is removed, there is a significant increase in Ganglion Cell Firing Rate
