# [064] Learning and Memory 1

# Learning and Memory

- Learning = acquisition of new information or knowledge.
- Memory = retention/storage of learned information within neural circuits.
- Retrieval is necessary to recall stored memories.
- Therefore, memory deficits/impairments can be due to defects in Learning, Memory or Retrieval of information (these are separate processes)

---

# Types of Memory

- Declarative memory concerns memories for facts and event that can be accessed for conscious recollection/recall (e.g. my first bike was a present on my 6th birthday).
- This can be subdivided into:
1. Episodic memory = recollecting/recalling specific events in time (i.e. I went to Paris last year).
2. Semantic memory = remembering familiar objects or facts outside/independent of their context in time (i.e. I know Paris is capital of France, but don’t necessarily remember where I found it out from).
- These are overlapping forms of memory, where Semantic Memories can have Episodic qualities (E.g Colours of Gifts receive on Birthday)
- Non-Declarative/Procedural memory concerns memories that do not require conscious recollection (unconscious memories) including habits or skills (e.g. knowing how to ride a bike).
- This can include association of experience with an emotion (e.g. feeling anxious when you go somewhere that previously made you feel anxious without needing to express that feeling).

---

# Short and Long Term Memory

- Short and long-term memory are present in all previous mentioned types of memory.
- Short-term memory - This lasts for a few minutes to hours, usually involves mental rehearsal and is easily disturbed in trauma (e.g. initial stages of learning a telephone number).
- Long-term memory - This is more permanent, does not require continued rehearsal, has greater capacity and is quite resistant to disturbance (e.g. memory for familiar telephone numbers)
- Working memory - This is a temporary hold of information in a ready-to-use form and then gotten rid of afterwards  (E.g instructions or remembering something temporarily but don’t want to remember forever).
- Its capacity is limited, needs rehearsal and is extremely susceptible to interference by distraction
- As Working Memory contains memories only required for a specific moment in time, Information in Working Memory is not translated into Long Term Memory/Store

### Formation of Declarative Memories

- Sensory Information can be held in working memory (to be used in the near future and then discarded of) or in short term memory, which is then moved into Long Term Memory via consolidation
- Consolidation describes processes that convert short-term memory into a long-term one.
- The Prefrontal Cortex is critical for Working Memory and the Medial Temporal Lobe is important in the formation of Long Term Memories from Short Term Memories

# Amnesia and Localisation of Memory Stores

### Amnesia

- Memory loss due to brain insult.
- Cause by concussion, chronic alcoholism, tumours, stroke.
- Causes can be acute or chronic, producing temporary or permanent amnesia.
- Retrograde Amnesia = loss of memory of events in a short period prior/before to trauma, with no impact on the ability to form and retrieve new memories.
- The duration of Retrograde Amnesia and memory decline produced can vary in duration from days to years
- There is graded/gradual loss of memory leading up to time of event but this decline in retrograde memory does not affect very early memories (E.g Childhood).
- If trauma causes temporary injury to the brain, Short Term Memory may be impaired, producing Retrograde Amnesia of a short duration (few minutes)
- If trauma causes permanent injury to the brain, Long Term Memory may be impaired, producing Retrograde Amnesia of a longer duration (Days-Months)
- Anterograde amnesia = inability to make or retrieve new memories after the trauma occurs without impacting retrieval of memories before the trauma.
- Pure retrograde or pure anterograde amnesias are rare, with most amnesias presenting clinically being mixed amnesias.
- In brain injury and disease, both forms are often seen together.
- A Transient Global Amnesia (TGA) can result from a Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA).
- Here there is usually an anterograde amnesia for the duration of the ischaemia with a short retrograde
amnesia of a few minutes (duration of short term memory processes that were active during the TIA).

### Where are Memories Stored?

- The Physical storage of memory is the engram.
- Brain lesions have been used to study which circuitry is essential for memory.
- Lashley, in 1920s, studied maze learning in rats with cerebral cortical lesions.
- Maze learning impairment was related to some extent to the size of lesion, so Lashley correctly concluded, that memories are distributed across neural circuits

# Working Memory and the Prefrontal Cortex

- Sometimes, information needs to be held in a short-term store of a few seconds or minutes, notably when used to carry out an ongoing task (E.g handing out leaflets to a group of people or remembering a number to call)
- Normally, Working Memory has a capacity of 7 ± 2 pieces of information
- This information may be new sensory information or information retrieved from long-term storage )E.g Identifying a specific objects from features such as Colour and Size recalled from Long Term Memory).
- This ready to use form of information is working memory.
- A good test of working memory is the Wisconsin card-sorting task, where test cards must be sorted according to colour, shape or number.
- The sorting rule must be worked out by remembering previous cards.

### Prefrontal Cortex and Working Memory

- Monkeys with prefrontal lesions perform badly in a delayed response task where a cue/instruction is given, there is a delay, and then a choice can be made.
- Prefrontal cortex lesions in humans produce deficits in working memory for problem solving (e.g. Wisconsin card sorting test).
- A few neurons in the Prefrontal Cortex are only active when the cue is given and when the action can be carried out
- There are a large of Neurons in the Prefrontal Neurons which produce a minor response when the cue is given, maintain high firing activity during the delay period and then become inactive when the choice is available to make (AKA only active in the Delay Period)

### Brain Activity in Working Memory

- Identity task – 3 sample faces and then a test face after a few seconds delay.
- Response required to “New face or same as one of the samples?”
- Location task – 3 sample faces in various locations on a screen and then a sample face in one location after a few seconds delay.
- Response required to “Has the face appeared in a new location or the same location as one of the samples?”
- In these tasks, various different frontal regions (Areas of the Frontal Lobe that are not motor or premotor) are activated, with some regions being activated in both the Identity and Location Tasks

# Temporal Lobe and Memory

- Kluver and Bucy (1939)- They showed that monkeys with large bilateral lesions of temporal lobes showed ‘psychic blindness’, where monkeys were unable to recognise objects.
- They repeatedly put same inedible objects into their mouths and lost ability to learn what objects were edible and which weren’t.
- Patient H.M: most famous clinical case in human memory literature.
- To treat severe epilepsy as a last resort, at age 27 years, received bilateral, medial temporal lobe resection (temporal lobes were source of his epileptic discharges).
- After surgery, epilepsy was greatly improved, but H.M. showed a nearly, total, profound amnesia that persisted until his death in December 2008.
- Medial Temporal Lobe structures refer to the Hippocampus, Entorhinal Cortex, Perirhinal Cortex and Parahippocampal Cortex moving laterally along the Cortex

# Patient HM

### Temporal Lobe Amnesia

- H.M. had partial retrograde amnesia.
- Could recall his early childhood, but not years before surgery.
- H.M. had profound anterograde amnesia.
- Formed almost no new declarative memories after surgery.
- Despite years of repeated memory test experiments, he had no declarative memory for them.
- Because he could recall early childhood, his retrieval mechanisms must have been undamaged.
- Short-term and Working memory was relatively normal. 6 numbers could be remembered with constant, uninterrupted rehearsal.
- Procedural memory (mirror writing involving tracing objects while only looking at your hand in a mirror) was normal. Therefore, as he learned mirror writing normally, so did not have a problem with his procedural memory.

### Temporal Lobe Pathology

- HM’s Surgery led to damage to the temporal lobe cortex, including rhinal and perirhinal cortex, amygdala and anterior hippocampus, which are interconnected.
- Cortical Association Areas → Parahippocampal and Rhinal Cortical Areas → Hippocampus → Thalamus and Hypothalamus (via the Fornix)
- Hippocampus → Cortical Association Areas via the Subiculum

# Recognition Memory In Monkeys - Animal Model of Temporal Lobe Amnesia

- Delayed non-match to sample (DNMS) - This is a test of recognising objects that have been seen recently, over seconds to minutes.
- Bilateral medial temporal lesions in monkeys severely impair DNMS with intervals > 15 s. This means that their Short term/working memory was quite good.
- Procedural memory was also intact.
- This was a good animal model of declarative memory amnesia seen in patient H.M.
- Monkey in a chamber is shown an object that has a reward under it so that if the monkey removes the object, they can get the reward.
- A curtain is placed over the chamber (so the monkey cannot see the object/reward), an extra object is introduced and the reward is now placed under the new vs previously seen object.
- This establishes a rule within the Working Memory that the reward is placed under the new object
- After a delay (longer than the duration of Working Memory to ensure the task tests short term memory) the curtain is then lifted so that the monkey can make a choice between the 2 objects in front of them
- Normal Px, with no Medial Temporal Lobe Injury, can remember the rule and maintain good levels of performance (recalling the rule and selecting the object with the reward under it), even when the delay is very long
- For subjects with Medial Temporal Lobe Injuries, performance deteriorates as the delay increases in duration

# Medial Temporal Lobe Amnesia - Critical Structures

- Originally, hippocampus and amygdala were thought to be critical for declarative memory losses seen.
- More recently, it has been shown that critical areas in long term memory formation are rhinal and perirhinal cortex, with the amygdala having little importance and the hippocampus having moderate importance.
- Reciprocal connections between the Hippocampus, Parahippocampal and Perirhinal Cortices and Cortical Association Areas allow for different regions of the circuit to have different contributions to memory formation, despite the circuit only having a single output from the Hippocampus.
- This makes this system an associative network

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 14.17.48.png](%5B064%5D%20Learning%20and%20Memory%201%20b7904fb66b30445da3d95d0909f06ceb/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_14.17.48.png)

- If parahippocampal and rhinal cortical areas are damaged, and outputting through hippocampus, then would expect that damage anywhere in circuit should have same effect.
- However, connections are reciprocal. Hippocampus has back projections, so even if PHC and RCAs are damaged, hippocampus can project back to other areas (entire output is not through fornix).

# Memory and the Hippocampus

- Lesions indicate an important role for hippocampus/ medial temporal lobe in declarative memory.
- Studies in rats show hippocampus may be especially involved in spatial memory.
- Hippocampal lesions impair ability to solve a spatial maze.
- Originally, this was interpreted as a working memory loss. Now it is viewed as a loss of the spatial/cognitive map - as proposed by O’Keefe (e.g.
O’Keefe and Nadel,1977).
- Hippocampal “place cells” code location in the environment - hence, hippocampal lesions damage these cells, leading to the subsequent loss of spatial memories.
- In a Radial Maze, there are 8 arms radiating out from a central container where the rat is placed.
- At the end of each arm, there is a reward placed in a well (so that the reward cannot be seen from within the central chamber)
- In rats with an intact Hippocampus, there are no duplication errors (rats do not go down the same arm twice) as it is able to recall that it has previously gone down a specific arm (Uses Working Memory)
- When food is only placed on specific arms, Rats with Hippocampal Lesions do not travel down arms that have no food (using working memory, they are able to recall which arms have food).
- However, they make duplication errors, where they travel down the same arm multiple times before they travel to different arms that contain food
- This indicates that working memory is impaired (unable to recall which arms they have gone down to reach food) but long term memory is intact (they are able to recall which arms have and do not have food)
- This means that the Hippocampus in rodents is important for working and spacial memory (where you have been etc.) but not in long term memory

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 18.19.04.png](%5B064%5D%20Learning%20and%20Memory%201%20b7904fb66b30445da3d95d0909f06ceb/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_18.19.04.png)

- This Spacial Memory, present via a cognitive map of space, is produced by populations of Place Cells that encode specific locations within an environment and hence, only fire when an individual is in the location corresponding to the specific place cell population

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 18.27.56.png](%5B064%5D%20Learning%20and%20Memory%201%20b7904fb66b30445da3d95d0909f06ceb/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_18.27.56.png)

- When moving to a new location, new place fields (regions of space that activate a specific place cell) form, with new populations of Place Cells corresponding to specific locations in this new environment

# Structures in the Diencephalon Involved in Memory

- The Medial Temporal Lobe projects via the Fornix to  the thalamus and mammillary bodies which forms a circuit.
- Alongside Spacial Memory, other sensory forms of information are also associated with the Hippocampus (notably in Early Memory Formation), with these memories moving to wider cortical areas from the Hippocampus as the memory is consolidated further and moved into Long Term Memory Stores
- Damage to either anterior or dorsomedial nuclei of thalamus or mammillary bodies of hypothalamus also disrupt memory.
- Circuits important in memory formation include:
1. Hippocampus → fornix → mammillary bodies → anterior nucleus of thalamus → cingulate cortex.
2. Temporal lobe cortex & amygdala → dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus → prefrontal cortex - This circuit is likely responsible for the extraction of information from Long Term Memory Stores into Working Memory
- Midline thalamic lesions in monkeys produce deficits in DNMS.

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 14.18.27.png](%5B064%5D%20Learning%20and%20Memory%201%20b7904fb66b30445da3d95d0909f06ceb/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_14.18.27.png)

# Midline Diencephalon Damage - Case N.A

- Stabbed with a fencing foil through his right nostril. Travelled leftwards through midline thalamus, particularly left dorsomedial thalamus.
- Severe anterograde amnesia and retrograde amnesia for 2 years before accident.
- Has difficulty watching TV programmes because he forgets plot during commercial breaks.
- Strong similarities with deficits seen in H.M. must relate to temporal lobe/diencephalic connections.

---

# Korsakoff’s Syndrome

- Chronic alcoholism depletes thiamine (vitamin B1) reserves and can lead to an amnesia state with anterograde amnesia and limited retrograde amnesia (Korsakoff’s amnesic state).
- Amnesia relates to degeneration of mammillary bodies and dorsomedial nucleus of thalamus.
- Other neurological signs can include ataxia, especially of gait, due to degeneration of cerebellar anterior lobe vermis which is highly sensitive to alcohol.
- Gait is affected but distal limb control is not.
- There may also be a confused state but it is important to note that this is not part of Korsakoff’s syndrome, but can occur along with it due to more widespread brain dysfunction.
- Treatment: vitamin B1 can lead to remarkable and rapid recovery of motor and confusion problems, but amnesias usually persist (as mammillary bodies have permanently degenerated).

---

# Alzheimer’s Disease

- Age dependent: 1-4% people at 65-70 years, 22% at 85-90 years.
- Neurofibrillary tangles (phosphorylated 𝜏) and neuritic plaques (amyloid).
- Disease severity correlates with tangles, not plaques.
- 𝜏 proteins stabilise microtubules. They are abundant in neurons of CNS.
- Structures affected first: hippocampus and posterior parietotemporal cortex.
- Episodic memory is affected first, and this is especially dependent on hippocampus.
- Also, degeneration of basal nucleus of forebrain (nucleus of Meynert) cholinergic neurons, noradrenergic neurons in locus coeruleus and serotonergic raphe neurons is seen.
- Retrograde amnesia spreads back in time as disease progresses.
- Episodic memory affected most with working and semantic memory
less so.
- This is because the Hippocampus is important in indexing and association of sensory information in the early stages of memory formation so that recently formed memories are highly dependent on the Hippocampus for their retrieval, and older memories are less dependent as these memories have been distributed across wider cortical areas
- Procedural memory is not impaired until final stages.

---

# Conclusions

- There is probably no single place in brain for memory formation and storage.
- Different forms of memory may be mediated by different brain areas.
- Even within a brain area, memories seem to be distributed.
- Short-term memories are fragile, long term memories are robust. So long-term memories probably depend on some form of structural change.
- Declarative memories are critically dependent upon medial temporal lobe and nuclei in diencephalon.
- There is good evidence that procedural memories depend upon other brain circuits.
- Habit learning, in which subjects learn that particular responses, lead to particular outcomes, depends upon the striatum.
- Memories with strong motor components (e.g. learning to ride a bicycle) depend upon motor cortex and the cerebellum.
