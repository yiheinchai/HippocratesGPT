# [073] Swallowing and Speech

# Swallowing

- Usually divided into 3 Phases:
1. Oral - Mainly Voluntary, involving Muscles of Mastication, Tongue Muscles and some muscles of Facial Expression like Orbicularis Oris and Buccinator
2. Pharyngeal - Mainly Muscles of the Pharynx, Larynx and Soft Palate
3. Oesophageal - Mainly Autonomic
- Oral Phase is most closely controlled by the Cerebral Cortex
- The Pharyngeal Phase is very important for protecting the airways and is a reflex that can be influenced by Descending influences from the Forebrain

### Anatomy of Swallowing

- The Pharynx is where the airway and food canal cross however, fine control of Pharyngeal and Laryngeal Muscles allows swallowing and breathing to occur separate to prevent aspiration of food
- Aryepiglottic Fold forms the Lateral Wall of the Entrance to the Larynx, running from the Epiglottis superiorly to the Arytenoids inferiorly
- Infraglottic Cavity = Laryngeal Atrium
- Vestibular Folds can be active to modify sounds produced in Phonation but mainly seal off the Superior Aspect of the Larynx during swallowing or effort closure of the Larynx to increase Intra-Abdominal pressure

- During Swallowing, the Larynx moves up and then back down to its resting position
- During high and low frequency/pitch phonation, the Larynx moves up and down respectively to make the Supralaryngeal Vocal Tract to shorten and elongate respectively

# Swallowing - Nerves

### Sensory Innervation

| Palate | CN V2 |
| --- | --- |
| Anterior 2/3rd Tongue | Somatosensory = CN V3 and Taste = CN VII |
| Posterior 1/3rd Tongue | Somatosensation and Taste via CN IX |
| Nasopharynx | CN V2 |
| Oropharynx | CN IX |
| Laryngopharynx | Recurrent Larygeal Nerve |
| Larynx above Vocal Folds | Internal Laryngeal Nerve |
| Larynx below Vocal Folds | Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve |

### Motor

| Tongue Muscles | CN XII |
| --- | --- |
| Palatine Muscles | CN XI via CN X |
| Pharyngeal Muscles | CN X and CN XI (Except for Stylopharyngeus that is supplied by CN IX) |
| Intrinsic Laryngeal Muscles | CN X (Recurrent Laryngeal Mainly) and CN XI |
| Extrinsic Laryngeal Muscles (Strap Muscles) | C1-C3 via Ansa Cervicalis |
| Respiratory Muscles (Diaphragm) | Phrenic Nerve |
| Upper Oesophagus (Swallowing) | Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve |
- Lots of control and co-ordination by brainstem, cerebral cortex and cerebellum is required.
- When this coordination goes wrong, Dysphagia arises
- There are many different types of Dysphagia but the most severe is Aspiration Dysphagia, where material being swallowed is aspirated, which may lead to Aspiration Pneumonia, which commonly leads to mortality

# Muscles

### Intrinsic Muscles of the Larynx

- Adductors of vocal folds and cricothyroid (increases vocal fold tension) are necessary for normal speech and controlling pitch.
- Posterior Cricoarytenoid Muscle is the only abductor of the Vocal Folds to allow for Inspiration
- Adductors, cricothyroid and aryepiglottic muscle are important for helping to close larynx during swallowing.
- Closure starts at vocal folds and moves upwards to the Vestibular Folds and entrance of the Larynx → This allows Foreign Objects that are aspirated and become lodged in the larynx to be displaced upwards and down the Laryngopharynx/out of the mouth.
- The Epiglottis is important in protecting the airway during swallowing but is not necessary as Px who have had their epiglottis surgically removed can still swallow as the Muscles that close the Vocal and Vestibular Folds completely seal off the Larynx when you swallow

### Infrahyoid Muscles

- Strap muscles (C1-3) control position of larynx and therefore quality of sound produced.
- Thyrohyoid is important for closing larynx during swallowing by increasing the folding of the Vestibular Folds.

### Pharynx

- 3 constrictors plus salpingopharyngeus and palatopharyngeus form the Pharyngeal Muscles.
- Cricopharyngeus = Inferior region of the Inferior Pharyngeal Constrictor = Upper Oesophageal Sphincter
- This is tonically contracted but opens at the beginning of swallowing to allow food to enter the Oesophagus
- Vagus and cranial accessory via  pharyngeal branches of vagus.
- Stylopharyngeus: glossopharyngeal nerve.

### Somatosensation and Taste Sensation from the Mouth

- Somatosensation of the Anterior 2/3rds of the Tongue is conducted via the lingual nerve from CN V3 and conveys information to the Spinal Trigeminal Nucleus towards the Cerebral Cortex via the Thalamus
- Somatosensation from Posterior 1/3rd of the Tongue is supplied by CN IX, which ends in the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract and the Spinal Trigeminal Nucleus towards the Thalamus
- Somatosensation from the Laryngeal Vesibule is supplied by the Internal Laryngeal Nerve to the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract and Spinal Trigeminal Nerve but also to the Swallowing Central Pattern Generator in the Brainstem (Notably Pharyngeal Phase of Swallowing which protects the Airway)
- Stimulating internal laryngeal nerve (sensory X) can initiate swallowing via Brainstem CPGs.
- Taste from the Anterior 2/3rds of the Tongue is conveyed via Chorda Tympani of CN VII and Taste from the Posterior 1/3rd of the Tongue is conveyed by CN IX
- Both fibes end in the Upper Part of the NTS, which is relayed up to the most Medial Part of the Ipsilateral Ventral Posterior Nucleus of the Thalamus and then to the Gustatory Cortex on the Insular Cortex and Parietal Operculum

# Areas of the Brain

### Tongue, Pharynx and Larynx

- NTS and Spinal trigeminal nuclei receive information from tongue, pharynx and larynx which are relayed to the Nucleus Ambiguus and Hypoglossal Nucleus.
- Hypoglossal nucleus and Nucleus Ambiguus supply muscles of the Tongue and the Pharynx + Larynx respectively
- Reticular formation neurones near nucleus ambiguus and NTS form ventral and dorsal parts of swallowing central pattern generator respectively.
- Brainstem strokes often cause dysphagia due to disruption of this CPG.

### Swallowing Area

- Swallowing area can be identified by electrical stimulation but fMRI shows that many cortical areas are active during swallowing.
- Stimulation of the Ventral Aspect of the Precentral Gyrus can produce swallowing
- This swallowing area also extends onto the Insular Cortex on the Medial Surface of the Cerebral Hemisphere, and more superiorly onto the Face Area of M1 and posteriorly into the Postcentral Gyrus/S1
- Swallowing is represented bilaterally, but 1 hemisphere is preferentially active during swallowing and it is easier to induce swallowing by TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) in that
hemisphere (Dysphagia is also more likely to occur if the stroke occurs in that region).
- This does not follow the Hemispheric Lateralisation pattern seen for speech
- Not clear why perhaps 25-50% of forebrain strokes cause dysphagia.
- Recovery often occurs over weeks or months.

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 14.27.50.png](%5B073%5D%20Swallowing%20and%20Speech%208c65f67e88184ce6a3195b0577cabfb1/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_14.27.50.png)

### Left Sided Cortical Stroke

- Following Recovery of Swallowing Function after a stroke, the Non-Dominant Hemisphere in regards to swallowing takes over most of the activity of the affected Hemisphere and becomes more active in swallowing and swallowing function is restored

### Pharyngeal Swallow Pathway

1. Taste, Visceral and Somatosensation from the Oral Cavity and Oropharynx is relayed to the NTS and Spinal Trigeminal Nucleus
2. Information is then relayed to the Cerebral Cortex and then to the Swallowing Central Pattern Generator in the Brainstem but also directly to this CPG from these nuclei
3. CPG then coordinates muscle activity that allows for Reflex Swallowing to occur safely without aspiration of food

# Speech and Dysarthria

### Speech

- Depends upon ability to produce elemental sounds, or phonemes that combine to form semantic (meaningful) morphemes, with morphemes being put together to form words.
- Words are sequenced according to rules of grammar and syntax to form sentences that can represent any level of descriptive and analytical complexity.
- Expression of language, in speech, requires timed control of airflow and of movement of lips, tongue and jaw.
- Speech needs accurate control of:
1. respiration - breathing control in speech to control airflow through the Vocal Apparatus of the Larynx
2. phonation - sound production in the larynx
3. resonance - Selective amplification of some sounds within the larynx
4. prosody - Varying intonation, stress and rhythm of speech
5. articulation - Movement timing in speech structures via fine muscular control (separation of different morphemes to allow for clarity of speech)
- Disruption of any aspects of these components results in dysarthria (poor generation of phonemes).
- As with small motor systems, there can be lower motor neuron (LMN) signs or upper motor neuron (UMN) signs that result in flaccid or spastic dysarthria respectively.

### Dysarthria - Loss of Fine Motor Control of Speech

### Flaccid Dysarthria

- LMN signs
- Damage in expressive system and corticobulbar pathways
- This results in weak speech production, poor articulation (little separation of words/morphemes)

### Spastic Dysarthria

- UMN signs
- Tension around lips. Too much drive to motor neurones
- During speech production, there is excessive tension in Facial Musculature

### Speech and Language Processing

- Beyond motor control and coordination needed for accurate expression of phonemes and words, language and speech depend upon multiple regions of cerebral cortex.
- Discovery of cortical speech areas was early in history of neurology and neuroscience in 1860s and 1870s.
- Restricted lesions of cerebral cortex were seen to be associated with loss of different aspects of speech.
- Control of speech was found to be strongly lateralised and dependent upon left cerebral cortex in most people.
- Losses of Higher Aspects of Speech and Language production are known as Dysphasia (Impaired Speech) or Aphasia (Lack of Speech)

# Brodmann Areas

- In 1909, Brodmann developed a cortical map using cytoarchitectonic criteria
- 47 different regions of cerebral cortex were identified.
- Cytoarchitecture has functional implications.
- These 47 regions are functionally different.
- Regions essential for normal speech were described by Broca (area 44/45) and by Wernicke (area 22).

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 15.34.04.png](%5B073%5D%20Swallowing%20and%20Speech%208c65f67e88184ce6a3195b0577cabfb1/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_15.34.04.png)

### Broca’s Area

- In 1861, Paul Broca described patient Tan (pronounced ‘ton’) who could not speak but understood spoken language.
- Post mortem examination revealed that Tan had a large lesion in left inferior frontal gyrus, Brodmann area 44 and 45.
- He found 8 similar patients. Similar lesions on right side did not result in
speech problems.
- These regions are supplied by middle cerebral artery.
- This area is described as an expressive or motor speech area.
- Patients understand spoken language but have difficulties expressing speech

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 15.36.29.png](%5B073%5D%20Swallowing%20and%20Speech%208c65f67e88184ce6a3195b0577cabfb1/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_15.36.29.png)

### Aphasia

- Inability to comprehend and formulate language.

### Severe Expressive Aphasia (Broca’s or Motor Aphasia)

- Patient Tono
- Patient knows what they want to say, and even think they are saying what they think they are saying.
- Patient seems unaware that they are saying same word again and again.
- Sarah Scott
- Aware can’t say something, but not saying right thing.
- Can articulate and form words. Can’t make motor plan.
- Writing not impaired

### Wernicke’s Area - Important for Comprehension and Meaningful Speech

- In 1874, Carl Wernicke described patients with lesions in left temporal lobe.
- They spoke fluently, but had difficulty comprehending language.
- Area identified as auditory association cortex (Brodmann area 22) together with inferior and posterior/adjacent parts of parietal lobe (Brodmann areas 39 and 40).
- This is known as Wernicke’s area.
- Supplied by branches of middle cerebral artery.
- This area is essential for interpretation and appreciation of intricate sounds.
- Projections from areas 41 and 42 enable turning of head and eyes to visualise sound sources.
- Area 22 receives and synthesises language data for sensory aspects of a language pattern.
- Damage here allows fluent speaking but comprehension and production of meaningful speech is lost (receptive aphasia).

### Wernicke’s Aphasia

- Byron Peterson
- Patient can speak. Lacks ideas to put together meaningful speech.
- Appears to understand question and appears to give an answer, but response does not make sense.

# Hemispheric Lateralisation

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 15.45.21.png](%5B073%5D%20Swallowing%20and%20Speech%208c65f67e88184ce6a3195b0577cabfb1/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_15.45.21.png)

### Wada Test

- Wada test determines which cerebral hemisphere is dominant for speech.
- Sodium amytal, a fast-acting anaesthetic, is injected into 1 carotid artery to transiently anaesthetise 1 hemisphere of brain.
- If left hemisphere is anaesthetised in people who have language ability in left
hemisphere, they cannot speak when asked to, they experience sudden transient aphasia.
- If their right hemisphere is anaesthetised, they are able to speak and answer questions (Delayed or very little aphasia).
- Results suggest that language lateralisation and handedness are not related.

# Wernicke-Geschwind Model of Speech

- Wernicke’s area: recognised as part of a larger posterior speech area (PSA) that includes the angular gyrus and surrounding temporal and parietal regions.
- Auditory and visual information converge on this area.
- Thus, heard speech and read text are processed here for recognition as words.
- Strong projections from PSA to Broca’s area, via arcuate fasciculus and extreme capsule, allows for the delivery of word-based signals to Broca’s area for transformation to a motor strategy which is delivered to adjacent motor cortex for control of muscles of speech production.
- The Arcuate Fasciculus contains bidirectional connections between the Posterior Speech Area to Broca’s Area, but the majority of these projections are anterior protections to Broca’s Area from the PSA

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 15.49.02.png](%5B073%5D%20Swallowing%20and%20Speech%208c65f67e88184ce6a3195b0577cabfb1/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_15.49.02.png)

### Reading and Speaking

- Primary Visual Cortex → Angular Gyrus → Brodmann Area 22 of Wernicke’s Area → Arcuate Fasciculus and Extreme Capsule → Broca’s Area → Motor Cortex

### Hearing and Speaking

- Auditory Cortex → Wernicke’s Area (Superior Temporal Gyrus → Angular Gyrus → Arcuate Fasciculus and Extreme Capsule → Broca’s Area → Motor Cortex
- Angular gyrus: important for integrating visual, auditory, somatic information.

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 15.52.56.png](%5B073%5D%20Swallowing%20and%20Speech%208c65f67e88184ce6a3195b0577cabfb1/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_15.52.56.png)

### Classical Models of Speech and Language are a Simplification

- Wernicke-Gerschwind model
accounts reasonably well for a simple
distinction between functions of Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas and is clinically useful
- But model is oversimplified and does not account for many complexities.
- Many more regions of cerebral cortex are importantly engaged in language and speech, as has been seen in imaging studies and from analysis of cortical lesions

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 15.53.14.png](%5B073%5D%20Swallowing%20and%20Speech%208c65f67e88184ce6a3195b0577cabfb1/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_15.53.14.png)

- Many aphasias are mixed include receptive and expressive elements.
- These can depend upon damage to additional cortical areas or to
connections between these regions (E.g Damage to Arcuate Fasciculus).

# Summary of Aphasias

- Broca’s aphasia - General impairment in language production, but not necessarily comprehension.
- Speech is nonfluent, telegraphic and may be effortful.
- Agrammatic (loss of semantics). Reading ability is good, but writing ability may be impaired.
- Wernicke’s Aphasia - Impairment in language comprehension, but not
necessarily production.
- Reading and writing are both affected.
- Different degrees of severity:
- Nominal aphasia (anomia) -  Difficulty in naming objects. Fluent in grammatical
form but full of vague circumlocutions (using more words than needed when trying to explain a concept) and expressions of frustration.
- Difficulty finding words is as evident in writing as in speech.
- Jargon Aphasia -  Fluent and grammatical, but meaningless.
- Incorrect and invented words are used.
- Global Aphasia - Lack of comprehension and lack of speech production.
- Extensive lesions of left hemisphere affecting Broca and Wernicke’s Area or connections between this.
- Conduction Aphasia - Arcuate fascicuclus or Extreme Capsule damage leads to loss of conduction from Wernicke’s area to Broca’s area.
- Ability to repeat heard or written words is
impaired. Fluent, grammatical speech.
- Many incorrect substitutions.
- Good comprehension.
- Patients often frustrated by these impairments.
