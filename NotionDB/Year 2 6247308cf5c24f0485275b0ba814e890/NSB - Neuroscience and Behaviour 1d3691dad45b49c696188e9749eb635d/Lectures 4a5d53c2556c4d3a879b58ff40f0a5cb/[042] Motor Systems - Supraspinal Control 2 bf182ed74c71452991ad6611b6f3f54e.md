# The Cerebellum and its Internal Structure

### Cerebellum

- It means the the lesser brain
- Unlike the Cerebral Hemisphere, it is not divided naturally into 2 lobes bilaterally and is found containing tissue that extends across the midline
- 10% total brain volume.
- It contains > 50% of total brain neurons (predominantly granule cells).
- This means that it has an extremely high neuron density which allows it to have a high computational/processing ability (mainly locomotive processing)
- Located above 4th ventricle.

### Internal Structure

Superficial to Deep:

- Cortex - This contains lots of neurons and is the main information processing aspect of the Cerebellum
- Nuclei (lateral to medial):
1. Dentate: Project anteriorly, sending some fibres to contralateral red nucleus, but most to the controlateral ventrolateral thalamus to M1 and Ventroanterior Thalamus to PMC (Notably PM).
2. This allows the Dentate Nucleus to influence the Corticospinal System and hence, voluntary movements (especially of the limbs).
- This receives fibres from the Hemispheres of the Cerebellar Cortex
1. Emboliform: project anteriorly and decussate
2. Paired Globose Nuclei: project fibres anteriorly which decussate. 
- A lot of these fibres from both nuclei project to contralateral red nucleus (source of rubrospinal system) and the rest passes forwards to contralateral ventrolateral thalamus to M1 to influence the Corticospinal Tract.
- The Globose and Emboliform Nuclei together form the Interposed Nucleus and receive fibres from the Pars Intermedia of the Cerebellar Cortex
1. Fastigial: projects down into vestibular nuclei (important in posture and balance).
- This receives fibres from the Vermis (Medial Cerebellar Cortex)
- This projects inferiorly and posteriorly to parts of the Ipsilateral Vestibular Nuclei and so, to the Vestibulospinal Tract to influence balance and posture and via Ascending Connections, eye movements
- All of these Cerebellar Nuclei also project into the Reticular Formation to influence the Reticulospinal System
- Cortical structure: grey matter lying over white matter. White
matter is large because of dense packing.
- Purkinje cell: axon projects downwards.

# Cerebellar Cortex

- The Purkinje Cell is the output cell of the Cerebral Cortex to the Vestibular Nuclei, found within a Monolayer (Purkinje Cell Layer)
- Dendritic Tree of the Purkinje Cell extends Superficially through the Cerebral Cortex and runs along its surface within the Molecular Cell Layer
- It receive lots of inputs, which are integrated at the Deeper Soma of the Purkinje Cell
- Inputs to Purkinje cell:
1. Mossy fibres: These ascend and terminate upon granule cell. 
- These mainly travel through the Middle Cerebellar Peduncle from the Pontine Nuclei but also through the Other Peduncles to some extent (Vestibular Nuclei project via Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle)
- Axon of Granule Cells ascend Superiorly and bifurcate within the Surface/Molecular Layer of the Cerebral Cortex and run transversely through the Purkinje Cell Dendritic Trees also found here, where it forms synaptic contacts with multiple Purkinje Cells
- This arrangement of Purkinje and Granule Cell Processes allows Purkinje cells to receive 250,000 parallel fibre inputs from Hundreds of Thousands of Granule Cell Axons (1 Purkinje to 100,000s of Granule Cells)
1. Climbing fibre: 
- A single Climbing Fibre ascends all over the dendritic tree of a single Purkinje cell, where it forms multiple synaptic contacts with its various dendrites
- 1 Purkinje to 1 Climbing Fibre
- Climbing Fibres come exclusively from inferior olive of medulla.

# Divisions of the Cerebellum

### Transverse Divisions

- The Cerebellar Cortex is a sheet which runs in the Sagittal Plane and is convex posteriorly, wraps under itself at the Anterior and Posterior ends of the Cortical Sheet
- The Organisation of the Cerebellar Cortex into Folia means that the Cerebellar Cortex is longer (in the Sagittal Plane) than it is wider (In the Transverse Plane)
- The Vermis is a rounded/cylindrical midline ridge that runs down the Cerebellar Cortex in the Sagittal Plane
- Each Lobe is comprised of Vermis, Intermediate Aspects and Hemisphere parts moving laterally

3 major transverse divisions (Lobes):

1. Anterior lobe
- This is contains very little hemisphere component
1. Posterior lobe
- This contains a large Hemisphere component
1. Flocculo-nodular lobe: medial part (nodulus), lateral parts (flocculus).
- This is formed from the Inferior End of the Cerebellar Cortex (when it is flattened out) that has curled up the Underside of the Cerebellum and is found Posterior to the Cerebellum
- These Lobes are separated by 2 deep transverse fissures:
1. Primary fissure (Separates Anterior Lobe from Posterior Lobe)
2. Posterolateral fissure (Separates Posterior and Flocculo-Nodular Lobe)
- Each lobe is divided into several lobules containing individual folia (names of most folia are not used anymore).
- The Tonsil is the Lateral Hemisphere component of the Inferior Lobule of the Posterior Lobe
- This is found just Superior to the Foramen Magnum and is easily damaged

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 15.13.22.png](%5B042%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Supraspinal%20Control%202%20bf182ed74c71452991ad6611b6f3f54e/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_15.13.22.png)

### Sagittal Divisions

- Instead of naming the individual Lobules, the Cerebellum is divided into 10 Separates transverse Lobules with 3 major sagittal divisions:
1. Medial cerebellum (vermis).
2. Intermediate cerebellum (pars intermedia).
3. Lateral cerebellum (hemispheres).
- The Anterior Lobe contains Lobules I-V, Posterior Lobe contains VI-IX and Flocculo-Nodular Lobe contains X
- The Hemispheric Aspect of Each Lobule is specified via the Addition of the 'H' Prefix whilst the Lobules of the Vermis are just defined I-X
- One Side of cerebellum projects to Ipsilateral cerebellar nuclei underneath/deep to it.

# Vestibulocerebellum

- This is comprised of the flocculo nodular lobe and vermis.
- It control proximal muscles and limb extensors to regulate balance, maintain posture and eye movements.

**Flocculo-Nodular Lobe:**

- Whilst most Vestibular CN VIII afferents from Vestibular Labyrinths go into the Vestibular Nuclei, some afferents project directly to the Flocculo-Nodular Lobe
- Some Projections from the Vestibular Nuclei extend superiorly into the Flocculus but also into a strip of Cerebellar Cortex that lies in the Lateral Aspects of the Vermis
- Neurons in the Lateral Aspect of the Vermis and the Flocculus then project to the Fastigial Nucleus, which projects down to end in the Vestibular Nuclei to influence the Vestibulospinal Tract
- This allows this system to control balance
- There are anterior projections from the Vestibular Nuclei to control Extraocular Muscles

**Vermis:**

- It receives input from neck and trunk, vestibular labyrinth, retina and extraocular muscles.
- Output focused on ventromedial descending system of brain stem (reticulospinal and vestibulospinal) and cortex (corticospinal fibres) to modify and control limb movements, posture and eye movements.

# Spinocerebellum

- This is formed predominantly by Intermediate cerebellum (Pars Intermedia) and regulates body and limb movements by coordinating movements
- This is heavily influenced by afferents within ascending spinocerebellar tracts which terminate in the Pars Intermedia (notably Anterior Lobe), conveying sensory information (primarily proprioceptive but also other modes of general sensation)
- This region projects to the Interposed Nuclei and Fastigial Nuclei
- Fibres project outwards from these nuclei to control dorsolateral descending systems (rubrospinal and corticospinal) acting on ipsilateral limbs.
- Notably, the Interposed Group projects anteriorly to especially influence the Red Nucleus (Rubrospinal System) whilst the Fastigial Nucleus projects to the Ventral Lateral Thalamus, which in turn influences and projects the Corticospinal Tract

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 15.20.16.png](%5B042%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Supraspinal%20Control%202%20bf182ed74c71452991ad6611b6f3f54e/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_15.20.16.png)

---

# Pontocerebellum

- This is formed by the Cerebellar Hemispheres and is involved in planning the control of the movement of the extremities (mainly upper limb) and timing of these movements
- Receives input from the Cerebral Cortex via pontine nucleus (which receives input from cerebral cortex - most association and motor cortices) via the Middle Cerebellar Peduncle.
- The Pontocerebellum then projects to the Dentate Nucleus, which projects to the Red Nucleus (Minor) and to the Ventrolateral (Major) and Ventral Anterior (Minor) Nuclei of the Thalamus, which project to M1 and PMA, SMA and some of the Posterior Parietal Cortex allowing them to influence motor control

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 15.21.35.png](%5B042%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Supraspinal%20Control%202%20bf182ed74c71452991ad6611b6f3f54e/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_15.21.35.png)

---

# Cerebellar Afferents

**Mossy Fibres**

1. Dorsal and ventral ascending spinocerebellar tracts (bringing light touch, discriminating touch, proprioception, pain, temperature)
- All feeds into cerebellum as a mix, providing cerebellum with information about somatosensory and proprioceptive events ongoing when making movements.
1. Descending lnformation from Visual, Auditory and Other Cortical Areas give off collaterals which synapse on pontine nuclei, which project to the pontocerebellum.
2. Copies of Motor instructions that descend down the corticospinal tract also project from M1 to the Pontine Nuclei (This is known as an efference copy). 
3. Vestibular information from Vestibular Nuclei/Vestibulospinal Tract.

**Climbing Fibre**

- From Contralateral inferior olive (unique and different).
- Fires if there is a mistake/error signal in relation to movement.

# Cerebellar Output Pathways

- Cerebellum has no private/unique output pathways (no 'Cerebellospinal Tract').
- It accesses the corticospinal, rubro-spinal, vestibulo-spinal and Reticulospinal pathways.
- There is a major output from the lateral parts via the Dentate Nucleus to the thalamus and motor cortex and hence, to influence the Corticospinal System .
- A smaller output from intermediate parts to red nucleus.
- An important output from medial part to vestibular nuclei.
- Left side of cerebellum influences right cerebral cortex (vice versa). Right cerebral cortex controls left side of body.

# Cerebellar Movement Control

- Flocculo-nodular lobe controls balance and eye movements.
- Vermis and pars intermedia adjust ongoing movement of whole body.
- Cerebellar hemispheres help coordinate planning of and execution of Voluntary Limb Movements due to projections to PM and M1 via VA and VL of the Thalamus respectively

---

# Cerebellar Lesions

- These reveal various aspects of Cerebellar Control
- This leads to difficulty in controlling the distance, velocity and force of movements.
- Hypotonus: loss of muscle tone due to reduced muscle spindle discharge via 1a Afferents.
- Ataxia: loss of co-ordination (hallmark of cerebellar disease). This consists of:
1. Deficiencies in movement distance (dysmetria - reaching movements over or undershoot), velocity, magnitude and rhythm/timing of muscle contractions.
2. Loss of co-ordination between different muscle groups (asynergia).
- This tends to include poor coordination of Synergist Action and a lack of Agonist-Antagonist control
1. Postural abnormalities.
- Ataxia ****of trunk and legs leads to ataxia of gait.
- Ataxia of arms: loss of smooth movements with intention tremor.
1. Force and rhythm deficiencies revealed as dysdiadochokinesia.
- Cerebellar Lesions often present with:
1. Slurred Speech
2. Trouble Eating and Swallowing
3. Deterioration of Fine Motor Control
4. Difficulty Walking and Gait Abnormalities
5. Eye Movement Abnormalities (Notably if disease is in Flocculo-Nodular Lobe)
6. Intention Tremor (When limbs are involved) - Tremor during Voluntary Movements, not at rest

---

# Simulating Cerebellar Lesions

- Monkeys held a lever in a fixed position. Occasionally, the position of the lever was disturbed and the task was to bring the lever back to the reference position.
- Monkeys easily and smoothly brought the lever back to the reference position, with appropriate bursts of activity in the biceps (pull the level) and then triceps muscle (terminate the flexion of the arm to bring the lever to the right position)
- If the cerebellar nuclei were temporarily inactivated, by cooling them (mimicking Cerebellar Lesion), the monkeys could not bring the lever back to the resting position, with the monkey oscillation/wobbling the lever around the target position
- This was due to uncoordinated and delayed activity bursts in the biceps and triceps muscles, with biceps activity being delayed and prolonged, producing a severely delayed Triceps activation.
- This leads to sucessive alternate cycles of Biceps-Triceps activation (oscillating pattern) that causes the Monkey to wobble the lever around its target
- This is the failure of agonist-antagonist relationships in cerebellar disruption which underlies the intention tremor seen in cerebellar patients.

# Theories of Cerebellar Control

- The Cerebellum receives external feedback/reafference about sensory consequences of movement (Proprioception and Somatosensory Information)
- Cerebellum receives copies of movement/motor plans from PMA and SMA (Internal feedback or efference copy).
- The Cerebellum uses the feedback information and the efference copy to build an 'Internal Model' of the Motor Control System (Forward Model) - This models/predicts how motor instructions going out to Muscle Fibres will produce forces and movements before the movement and its outcome have occurred
- This allows it to estimate future sensory inputs based on motor outputs.
- Once the Internal Model has been constructed, it can take the efference copy and predict what the motor commands will achieve when carried out (Movements produced etc.) by utilising internal circuitry within the Cerebellum - This is far quicker than waiting for the actual results to be fed back to the Cerebellum via Proprioception
- This allows for movements to be corrected as they are being made (as instructions are travelling down Descending Motor Tracts by having the Cerebellar Internal/Forward Model working as a side loop to the motor instructions running in Descending Motor Tracts (Motor Instructions run through this loop via an Efference Copy and make adjustments to the Internal Model as necessary, based on the predicted Movement outcome of executing the the Motor Plans/Forward Plan and Reafference, to produce these corrected movements)
- This allows for the Cerebellum to adjust motor outputs for fine control of movements and reflex calibration (It is predictive in function) when Reafference does not match with Predicted outcomes of the execution of the motor plans (Cerebellum makes corrections to balance these External and Internal Feedback Forms)
- Therefore, to maintain this continuous correction of Motor Plans, the Cerebellum needs to keep the Forward Model Accurate through a motor learning process via Proprioceptive Feedback/Reafference Information in the form of an Inverse Model (It is important in Motor Learning)

# Basal Ganglia and Their Function

- **Collection of Nuclei moving Medially:**
1. Caudate nucleus
2. Putamen
3. Globus Pallidus (Externa and Interna)
4. Subthalamic nucleus
5. Substantia Nigra (Inferior to Subthalamic Nucleus - Comprised of Pars Reticularis and Pars Compacta).
- Caudate Nucleus + Putamen = Corpus Striatum - This forms the input-receiving aspect of the Basal Ganglia

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 15.37.12.png](%5B042%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Supraspinal%20Control%202%20bf182ed74c71452991ad6611b6f3f54e/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_15.37.12.png)

### Function

- The Excitation of the Corpus Striatum from the Cerebral Cortex flows through direct and indirect pathways to control the VA of the thalamus and thus, the SMA.
- Hypokinetic basal ganglia disorders like Parkinson’s disease prevent movement initiation (often due to low Dopamine) as the Indirect Pathway dominates over the Direct Pathway through the Basal Ganglia.
- Hyperkinetic disorders such as ballism (damage to subthalamic
nucleus) and Huntington’s disease (Initially, there is degeneration of the D2-Expressing Strial Neurons that contribute to the Indirect Pathway) indicate that basal ganglia may normally filter out unwanted movement.
- D1 and D2 expressing Neurons of the Corpus Striatum are connected to one another via GABAergic Collaterals and Cholinergic Interneurons
- The Basal Ganglia network works to select actions from a nearly infinite range of Possibilities due to significant Cortical Inputs, using Strong Lateral Inhibition between Parallel Circuitry within the Striatum and Gpi/SNr levels allowing the strongest action to come through whilst suppressing all others
- This selection can involve the other parallel loops within the Basal Ganglia (E.g Emotional States signalled within the Limbic Loop influence action selection)

# Basal Ganglia Connections and Circuitry

### Connections

- Information tends to flow medially through the Basal Ganglia
- Input arrives at the Corpus Striatum
- Output of the Basal Ganglia is from the Globus Pallidus Interna and Substantia Nigra Pars Reticularis (Ventral Aspect of Substantia Nigra) into various divisions of the Thalamus
- Thalamic Nuclei then project to various Cortical Regions such as M1 and PMC
- Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta provides Dopaminergic Input to the Various Nuclei of the Basal Ganglia

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 15.39.25.png](%5B042%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Supraspinal%20Control%202%20bf182ed74c71452991ad6611b6f3f54e/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_15.39.25.png)

### Circuitry (Transmitters and Cotransmitters)

- Neurons of the Basal Ganglia release a range of transmitters and cotransmitters, which differentially stimulate different receptor subtypes to allow for all of the Basal Ganglia Loops to occur independently of one another

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 15.39.56.png](%5B042%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Supraspinal%20Control%202%20bf182ed74c71452991ad6611b6f3f54e/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_15.39.56.png)

### Direct and Indirect Pathways

- Most signals to the Basal Ganglia originate in the Cerebral Cortex and go to the Striatum, where they can then take the Direct or Indirect Pathway
- Different Cell types in the Striatum are the source of the Direct and Indirect Pathways (Named on the pathway through the Nuclei between the Striatum and SMA)
- Between the Striatum to the Thalamus in the Direct Pathway (Striatum → Globus Pallidus Pars Internus + Substantia Nigra Pars Reticulata → Thalamus), there is only GABAergic Transmission at each step (Inhibitory)
- Direct pathway: ↑ movement. The presence of an excitatory synapse (Cortex → Striatum), followed by 2 Inhibitory Synapses means that there is Inhibition of inhibition (disinhibition) of the Thalamus (Inhibition of Inhibitory Neurons in GpI and SNpR), leading to Thalamic excitation
- In the Indirect Pathway (Striatum → GpE → Subthalamic Nucleus and GpI + SnPr → Thalamus) = Inhibitory whilst Subthalamic Nucleus → GpI and SnPr = Excitatory (Glutamate)
- This means that there is Disinhibition (Excitation) of the Subthalamic Nucleus, which increases Inhibitory outflow from the GpI and SnPr to the Thalamus, inhibiting the Thalamus
- Indirect pathway: ↓ movement. The presence of 3 Inhibitory Synapses means that there is Disinhibition of Inhibition, enhancing Inhibition
- Both of these pathways converge on the Thalamus and then, to the SMA
- The Output of the Basal Ganglia Circuitry is determined by a balance in activity between the Direct and Indirect Pathways

# Direct Pathway and Dopamine

- Striatal Cells that project directly to the Globus Pallidus Pars Interna (GPi) and the Substantia Nigra Pars Reticulata (SNr) - Source of Direct Pathway - Express D1 Receptors
- Dopamine is excitatory/acts as an excitatory modulator upon D1 Receptors (Causes Neurons to become Hyperexcitable) and hence, Dopamine stimulates the Direct Pathways and promotes movement

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 15.42.05.png](%5B042%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Supraspinal%20Control%202%20bf182ed74c71452991ad6611b6f3f54e/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_15.42.05.png)

---

# Indirect Pathway and Dopamine

- Striatal Cells that project directly to the Globus Pallidus Pars Externa (Source of Indirect Pathway) express D2 Receptors
- Dopamine is Inhibitory/an Inhibitory Modulatory at D2 Receptors, causing these neurones to become Hypoexcitable
- Hence, Dopamine Inhibits the Indirect Pathway, which Inhibits Thalamic Inhibition, producing Disinhibition which prevents movement

![Screenshot 2021-12-01 at 15.42.56.png](%5B042%5D%20Motor%20Systems%20-%20Supraspinal%20Control%202%20bf182ed74c71452991ad6611b6f3f54e/Screenshot_2021-12-01_at_15.42.56.png)

# Frontal Lobe and Basal Ganglia

- Several Cerebral Cortical Areas contain reciprocal connections with Basal Ganglia
- Motor Control is established by the Motor Loop between M1, PMC and the Basal Ganglia to control movement
- Other connections of basal ganglia:
1. Limbic associations (emotional behaviour): Anterior cingulate cortex, Medial orbital frontal cortex.
2. Prefrontal (higher executive functions): dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex and lateral orbital frontal cortex.
3. Oculomotor: supplementary eye field and frontal eye fields.

# Parallel Circuits Through the Basal Ganglia, Thalamus and Cerebral Cortex

- There are 5 Major Parallel, Looping Circuits through the Basal Ganglia:
1. Motor
2. Oculomotor
3. Dorsolateral Prefrontal
4. Lateral Orbitofrontal
5. Anterior Cingulate
- These operate relatively individually (with minimal interaction/in parallel with one another) to allow for separate information processing within the Basal Ganglia through these various loops
- There are lateral inhibitory interactions between the various loops within the input/Corpus Striatum layer and the the output (Globus Pallidus Pars Interna/Substantia Nigra Pars Reticulata) layer, which form common steps in the Circuits
- This means that whilst the processing within each loop is separate/discrete, the lateral connections allow for competition between the Various Basal Ganglia-Thalamocortical Loops (Lateral Connections inhibit other Parallel Loops) to determine which loop forms the primary/dominant output of the Basal Ganglia and hence, determines the specific movement produced
- The Loop is generally structured as Cortex → Striatum → Pallidum and Substantia Nigra → Thalamus → Cortex
