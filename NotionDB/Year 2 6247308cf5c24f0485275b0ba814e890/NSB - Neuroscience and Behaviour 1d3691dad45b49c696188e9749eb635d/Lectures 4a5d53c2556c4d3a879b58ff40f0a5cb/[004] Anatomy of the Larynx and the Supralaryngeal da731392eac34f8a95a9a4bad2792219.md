# [004] Anatomy of the Larynx and the Supralaryngeal Vocal Tract

# Functions of the Larynx

- It is a valve that protects the entrance to the Tracheobronchial Tree, notably during swallowing
- Here, the Vocal and Vestibular Folds adduct, the Epiglottis Moves down and the Larynx rises during swallowing
- If its protective role is ineffective, laryngeal incompetence can lead to food and fluid being aspirated into the Trachea
- Some activities required temporary closure of the Respiratory Tract to increase the pressure in the chest/abdomen such as coughing, lifting heavy weights or using increased abdominal pressure (defecation, micturition and child birth)
- It controls airflow through the respiratory tract during rest, exercise and phonation

# Surface Anatomy and Topography of the Larynx

- It is found inferior to the hyoid, anterior to the laryngopharynx and above the 1st cartilaginous tracheal ring
- The Thyroid Cartilage located in neck midline, below the 3rd to 4th cervical vertebrae
- The Thyroid Eminence of the Larynx is visible on the anterior surface of neck as “Adam’s apple” – often prominent in males
- It houses the vocal folds which run anteroposterior across the larynx
- They divide the laryngeal cavity into superior (= vestibule) and inferior (= atrium) regions
- The space/gap between the vocal folds is called the rima glottidis

# Components of the Larynx

- It is comprised of 4 major cartilages, united by mobile synovial joints, with Ligaments and Membranes helping to fill the gaps between these cartilages
- Whilst the Hyoid bone is not part of the Larynx, it is the superior anchoring point for the Larynx
- The Cartilage skeleton provides support and mediates the key functions of the larynx
- The Epiglottis is made of Fibrocartilage
- Ligaments bind the cartilages together
- Intrinsic and Extrinsic Laryngeal Muscles move the cartilages of the Larynx relative to each other or move the Larynx as a whole respectively
- Most of the Larynx is lined with Respiratory Epithellium (Pseudostratified Ciliated Columnar) except for the Vocal Folds which are covered by Stratified Squamous Epithelium
- The Larynx has outer and inner walls, which arise from the Cricoid Ring inferiorly

![f008-220-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f008-220-9780323393041.jpeg)

- The Outer Wall of the Larynx is formed by the Thyrohyoid Membrane, Thyroid Cartilage, Cricothyroid Membrane and Cricoid Cartilage moving inferiorly

### Thyroid Cartilage

- The Thyroid Cartillage is the largest cartilage ring of the Larynx and is formed of two Laminae which project anteromedially to meet in the Midline at an Angle (Laryngeal Prominence)
- This is found superior to the Cricoid Cartilage
- This may be seen and palpated in the midline of the neck as the Adam's Apple (This can be seen anteriorly, predominantly in men as the angle between the Laminae becomes more acute at puberty, making the prominence sharper)
- A Superior Thyroid Notch is an indentation that can be palpated between the two laminae, superior to the Laryngeal Prominence
- The Posterior Margin of the Laminae of the Thyroid Cartilage is extended superiorly and inferiorly as slender Superior and Inferior Horns/Cornua
- The Oblique Line of the Thyroid Cartilage is found at the Posterior margin of the Lamina of the Thyroid Cartilage, extending anteroinferiorly from the Base of the Superior Cornu to halfway along the Inferior Border of the Lamina

![f008-211a-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f008-211a-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Cricoid Cartilage

- It is the Shape of a Signet Ring, with the narrow/thinner part of the ring lying anteriorly and the thicker/wider section posteriorly
- The Anterior Aspect of the Cricoid Cartilage may be palpated in the neck, below the Thyroid Cartilage
- The Inferior Cornu of each Thyroid Lamina forms a synovial articulation with a facet on the Posterolateral Aspect of the Cricoid to form the Cricothyroid Joints

![f008-210-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f008-210-9780323393041.jpeg)

- The Inner Wall of the Larynx is comprised of Membranes, Muscles, Arytenoid Cartilages posteriorly and the Epiglottis superiorly
- The Leaf-Life Epiglottis is attached by the Thyroepiglottic Ligament to the inner surface of the Laryngeal Prominence found inferiorly, Forming the Anterior Border of the Inner Wall of the Larynx
- The Epiglottis points Superoposteriorly from its attachment to the Thyroid Cartilage, posterior to the Thyrohyoid Membrane, Hyoid Bone and Tongue
- Paired Arytenoid Cartilage are found on the Posterosuperior Border of each Lamina of the Cricoid, with the base of the Arytenoid and the Superior Border of the Cricoid Laminae having a synovial articulation.
- Each Arytenoid Cartilage is pyramidal in shape and are found posteroinferior to the Epiglottis
- When closing the Larynx (E.g During Swallowing), the Superior Aspect of the Epglottis bends posteriorly towards the Arytenoids, to cover the Laryngeal Inlet, creating a ridge that diverts a Bolus down the Oesophagus

# Larynx Ligaments - Intrinsic and Extrinsic

### Extrinsic Ligaments (Bind the Laryngeal Cartilages together)

- The Thyrohyoid Membrane attaches to the Superior Border of the Lamina and Greater Horns of the Thyroid Cartilage inferiorly and the Inner Border of the Body and Greater Horns of the Hyoid Superiorly
- This closes the Gap between the Thyroid Cartilage and the Hyoid Bone
- The Cricothyroid Ligament/Membrane (Strong) attaches to the Inferomedial Border of the Thyroid Cartilage superiorly and the Medial Cricoid
- This closes the anterior gap between the Cricoid and Thyroid Cartilages superiorly and inferiorly respectively
- The Cricoid Superiorly is attaches to the 1st ring of the Tracheal Cartilage by the Cricotracheal Ligament

![f008-215-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f008-215-9780323393041.jpeg)

![External-Ligaments-and-Cricothyroid.jpg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/External-Ligaments-and-Cricothyroid%201.jpg)

### Intrinsic Ligaments (Shape the Inside of the Larynx)

- The Inner wall of the Larynx is completed by a fibroelastic membrane that extends from the Lateral Sides of the Epiglottis superiorly to the Arytenoids posteroinferiorly and down to the Lower Aspect of the Thyroid Cartilage
- The Region of this membrane found between the Lateral Sides of the Epiglottis anteriorly, the Arytenoids Posteriorly and Thyroid Cartilages laterally is the Quadrangular Membrane and is less well developed (Fibroelastic Membrane here is replaced by muscle fibres)
- The Quadrangular Membrane ends inferiorly at a sharp free border that runs between the Arytenoid posteriorly and the Thyroid Lamina anteriorly (Vestibular Ligament)
- When these Vestibular Ligaments are covered with Mucosa, they form the Vestibular Folds (False Vocal Cords)
- There is a slit-like gap inferior to the Vestibular Ligament and superior to the Vocal Ligament, known as the Vestibular Recess - This contains a blind-ended sac containing Mucous Secreting Glands which lubricate the Vocal and Vestibular Folds
- Beneath this gap is the Conus Elasticus/Cricovocal membrane, with the superficial part of the Conus elasticus in the midline anteriorly forming the Cricothyroid Ligament between the Cricoid Cartilage and Thyroid Cartilage
- The Conus Elasticus arises from the Upper Margin of the Cricoid Cartilage inferiorly and attaches to the Vocal Process of the Arytenoid Cartilages posteriorly and the Thyroid Cartilage anteriorly.
- It has a free margin that is thickened and runs from the Vocal/Anterior Process on the Base of the Arytenoid Cartilage (found posteriorly) to the Posterior Surface of the Midline of the Two Thyroid Laminae (found anteriorly). This is called the Vocal Ligament
- This forms the Inferior Border of the Slit in the Inner Wall of the Larynx whilst the Vestibular Ligament form the Superior Border of this Slit
- When the Vocal Ligament is covered with Mucous Membrane, it is called the Vocal Fold
- The Aryepiglottic Fold is a triangular fold of the Mucous Membrane of the Larynx which extends from the Lateral Borders of the Epiglottis Superiorly to the Arytenoid Inferiorly, covering the Free Superior Edge of the Quadrangular Membrane
- They are found superior to and enclose the Aryepiglottic Muscle

![f41-05-9780702077050.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f41-05-9780702077050.jpeg)

- The Thyroid, Cricoid and most of the Arytenoid Cartilages are made of Hyaline Cartilage whilst the Epiglottis and Apices/Superior Aspects of the Arytenoids are made of Elastic Fibrocartilage
- Two Small rounded Corniculate and Cuneiform Cartilages are located along the Posterior Border of the Quadrangular Membrane and its associated muscle, with the Cuneiform Cartilage found superior to the Corniculate Cartilage
    
    ![f008-217-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f008-217-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Intubation, Coniostomy and Tracheostomy

### Coniostomy/Cricothyrotomy

- The Most common Airway Obstruction results from objects becoming lodged in the Laryngeal Inlet alongside a reflex spasm of the Laryngeal Muscles
- Usually, the obstruction can be used dislodged by coughing, manually removing it with the fingers or via Abdominal Thrusts/Heimlich Manoeuvre
- When this cannot be done in an **emergency situation** (E.g Obstructions, Carcinoma of the Mouth and Face, Inflammation of the Larynx and Pharynx or Fractures to the Cervical Spine), an incision can be made through the Cricothyroid Membrane in the Midline, found below the Vocal Folds at the entrance to the Trachea

![Screenshot 2021-11-03 at 00.01.08.png](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/Screenshot_2021-11-03_at_00.01.08.png)

- Small items that are swallowed with difficulty tend to get stuck in the Piriform Fossa and sometimes need to be removed

### Tracheostomy

- This is an elective procedure to reduce the dead space in the airway of a weak patient or to facilitate prolonged artificial ventilation of patients
- This is often done when long term access and management of the airways is needed
1. A transverse incision is made in the neck through the Skin and Platysma (In the same direction that the skin creases upon Neck Flexion), midway between the Cricoid Cartilage and the Suprasternal Notch
2. The Infrahyoid Muscles are then retracted to each side and the Isthmus of the Thyroid Gland is identified
3. This is extremely vascular and so, is clamped, ligated and divided (Taking care as to not damage the External Laryngeal and Recurrent Laryngeal Nerves)
4. The Trachea deep to the Thyroid is opened below the First Tracheal Ring and a flap is created by cutting inferiorly at both ends of the transverse incision, and reflecting the flat inferiorly
5. This flat is then sewn to the skin superficial to the flat to ensure clear access to the airway

### Intubation

- When gaining and maintaining access to the airways, the preferred method/access is Endotracheal Intubation, through the Larynx and into the Trachea via the Mouth
- When intubating a Px, the tip of the Laryngoscope should be placed in the Vallecula and the base of the tongue should be pulled anteriorly
- This brings the Laryngeal Inlet into clear view, allowing a tube to be inserted through the Rima Glottidis into the Trachea

# Movement of the Laryngeal Cartilages (From D&P - Not Lectures)

- The Vocal Ligaments regulate airway size and are involved in Phonation, with the tension and position of these ligaments controlled by movements at the Cricothyroid and Cricoarytenoid Joints respectively

![f41-02-9780702077050.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f41-02-9780702077050.jpeg)

- Movements at the Cricothyroid Joint tilts the Thyroid Cartilage Anteriorly or Posteriorly whilst the Cricoid Cartilage remains immobile, increasing or decreasing the tension within the Vocal Ligaments
    
    ![Scannable Document on 9 Nov 2021 at 11_09_43 am.png](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/Scannable_Document_on_9_Nov_2021_at_11_09_43_am.png)
    
    ![f008-219-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f008-219-9780323393041%201.jpeg)
    
- Movements at the Cricoarytenoid Joints can abduct or adduct the Cartillages away or towards the Laryngeal Midline (sliding away or towards each other to move the vocal processes of the Arytenoids towards or away from the midline)
- The True Vocal Folds (Formed by the Vocal Ligaments) also move apart on Deep Inspiration, likely due to the Trachea stretching downwards and drawing the mucous membrane around the Laryngeal Inlet with it
- This causes the Gap between the Vocal Ligaments (Rima Glottidis) to change size and shape with the abduction and adduction of the Arytenoids and Vocal Ligaments/Folds on deep inspiration
- When there is abduction/lateral movement of the Arytenoids and Vocal Ligaments, the Rima Glottidis widens posteriorly whilst remains narrow anteriorly at the Thyroid Cartilage, making it appear triangular and when there is adduction of the Arytenoids and Vocal Ligaments, the Rima Glottidis appears more rectangular as the Arytenoids and Thyroid Cartilages are found in a similar sagittal plane
- As the Cricoarytenoid Joints are cylindrical, they also allow for anteroposterior rocking of the Arytenoids (Similar to the Movements seen at the Cricothyroid Joints)
- When the Arytenoids rock anteriorly and posteriorly (Towards and Away from the Thyroid Cartilage), the Vocal Ligaments tighten/increase tension and loosen/decrease tension - These movements however are opposed by Muscles that pull in the other direction

# Intrinsic Laryngeal Muscles

- These are found within the Larynx, between its Cartillaginous Components and move the Laryngeal Cartilages at the Cricothyroid and Cricoarytenoid joints
- These are functionally divided into 3 Groups:
1. Those that move the Epiglottis to close the Laryngeal Inlet or Close the Laryngeal Inlet - Their Sphincter Action on the Laryngeal Inlet is used to resist high intrathoracic/Abdominal Pressures (generated during Coughing and Lifting Heavy Objects) and is important during swallowing
2. Abduction and Adduction of the Vocal Cords to control the size of the Rima Glottis - These are used in controlling airflow, protecting the airways during swallowing and during phonation
3. Those that alter the Tension/Length of the Vocal Cords - This is used in phonation to control the pitch of the sound produced
- All of the Intrinsic Muscles of the Larynx are involved in all of these functions as they work as a unit, but some muscles may be more involved in some functions than others
- They act on the Cricothyroid, Cricoarytenoid Synovial Joints and the Thyroepiglottic Ligament to move the individual Cartilage units relative to each other

### Muscles of the Laryngeal Inlet

- The Aryepiglottic Muscle runs in the Superior Margin of the Quadrangular Membranes (within the Aryepiglottic Fold), originating from the Apex of the Arytenoids and Inserting onto the Lateral Aspects of the Epiglottis
- The Oblique Arytenoids originate from the Posterior Surface of the Muscles that are found across the Posterior Wall of the Larynx and project obliquely upwards across the Midline, along the Posterior Surface of the Arytenoids and Transverse Arytenoid to insert onto the Posterior Surface of the Contralateral Arytenoid Apex
- The Aryepiglotic and Oblique Arytenoids form a Sphincter of the Laryngeal Inlet and their contraction brings the Aryepiglottic Folds together and the Epiglottis closer to the Arytenoid Cartilage to close the Laryngeal Inlet
- This Strong Sphincteric Action at the Inlet can resist High Intrathoracic Pressures, as when coughing or lifting heavy objects, keeping the Larynx closed

- The Thyroepiglottic Muscle originates from the Posterior Surface of the Thyroid Cartilage and runs posterosuperiorly to insert onto the Lateral Margins of the Epiglottis
- This opens the Laryngeal Inlet by pulling the Epiglottis Anteriorly, along with other smaller muscles in the wall of the Inlet

### Muscles that Abduct and Adduct the Vocal Folds

- Abduction or Adduction of the Vocal Folds increases and decreases the volume of air passing through the Larynx respectively
- Stretching of the Trachea during Deep Inspiration and Contraction of the Sternothyoid Muscle abduct the Vocal Folds, independent of the activity of the Intrinsic Laryngeal Muscles
- The Posterior Cricoarytenoids are large, fan-shaped muscles that arise from the Posterior Aspect of the Cricoid and travel superolaterally to converge and insert onto the Lateral Angle of the Arytenoid Cartilage (Lateral Process)
- These Abduct and Externally Rotate the Arytenoids and hence, the Vocal Folds but by a debated mechanism.
- Some say that the Upper Fibres of these muscles rotate the Arytenoid laterally (around a Sagittal Axis) so that the Vocal Process turns laterally, abducting the vocal cord but if the Cricoarytenoid Joint was really Cylindrical, this would not be possible so this mechanism is debated
- It is accepted that the Lateral Fibres of the Cricoarytenoids Abduct and Internally Rotate the Arytenoids/Pull them Laterally (Gliding Movement at the Cricoarytenoid Joint) - This is the main accepted mechanism of Vocal Fold Abduction
- The Posterior Crycoarytenoids oppose the pull of the Cricothyroid Muscle (which acts to tense the Vocal Ligament). Without this resistance, a strong contraction of the Cricothyroid Muscle would move the Thyroid Cartilage anteriorly, causing the Arytenoids to fall forwards
- The Lateral Cricoarytenoid originates from the Lateral Side of the Cricoid and runs Superomedially to insert onto the Muscular Process of the Arytenoid and acts alongside the Posterior Cricoarytenoid to abduct the Vocal Ligament (it is unlikely to ever act alone in doing so and hence, is a Synergist to the Posterior Cricoarytenoids)
- The Transverse Arytenoid Originates from the Lateral Aspect of the Arytenoid Cartilage on one side and Passes Posterior to the Arytenoid Cartilage (but anterior to the Oblique Arytenoid) to insert onto the Lateral Aspect of the Contralateral Arytenoid Cartilage.
- This acts to Adduct and Internally Rotate the Arytenoids and the Vocal Folds
- There are more muscles which Adduct the Arytenoids/Narrow the Rima Glottidis than Abduct the Arytenoids/Widen the Rima Glottidis as widening of the Rima Glottidis occurs naturally when the Intrinsic Laryngeal Muscles Relax

![f008-223-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f008-223-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Muscles that Tense and Relax the Vocal Ligaments

- Altering the Tension of the Vocal Ligaments changes the pitch of the voice as is mainly controlled by the action of Thyroarytenoid and Cricothyroid on the Cricothyroid Joint
- Thyroarytenoid arises from the Internal Aspect of the Laryngeal Prominence and projects posteriorly to insert onto the Anterolateral Surface of the Arytenoid mainly. Some fibres ascend to Insert on the Epiglottis to form the Thyroepiglottic Muscle
- The Thyroarytenoid pulls the entirety of the Arytenoid Cartilages anteriorly to relax the Vocal folds (this also opens up Rima Glottidis)

- The Vocalis is a deep, triangular bundle of fibres from the Thyroarytenoid, found just lateral to the Vocal Folds
- These are able to selectively abduct one part of the Vocal Fold whilst the remaining aspects of the Vocal Fold remain adducted - This allows for the production of high pitch sounds whilst the Vocal Folds are already maximally tensed by the Cricothyroid

- The Cricothyroid Muscles lie on the outer surface of the Larynx, originating from the Anterolateral Cricoid Cartilage and running posteriorly to insert onto the Inferior Cornu of the Thyroid Cartilage
- These oppose the lateral pull of the Arytenoids by the Posterior Cricoarytenoids and the Anterior Pull of the Arytenoids towards the Thyroid by the Thyroarytenoid
- They act to produce high pitched sounds by rotating the Thyroid Cartilage anteroinferiorly to elongate and tense the Vocal Folds

# Interior of the Larynx (D&P Only)

- The Interior of the Larynx is lined with Mucous Membrane, which is reflected from the Tongue Superiorly onto the Epiglottis posteriorly as 1 Median and 2 Lateral Glossoepiglottic Folds (Found either side of the Median Fold)
- The Depression found either side of the Median Fold, between the Posterior Tongue and Epiglottis is called the Vallecula
- Between the Outer and Inner Walls of the Larynx, The Mucous Membrane is folded into a Piriform Recess/Fold

- The Plane of the Laryngeal Inlet is almost vertical and leads into the Upper Part of the Larynx (Vestibule)
- The Vestibule of the Larynx extends from the Inlet down to the Vestibular Fold/False Vocal Fold (Inferior Margin of Quadrangular Membrane)
- The Gap between the Two Vestibular Folds is known as the Rima Vestibuli
- Between the Vestibular Folds superiorly and the Vocal Folds inferiorly there is an opening into the Ventricle of the Larynx
- The most superior Aspect of the Ventricle of the Larynx is known as the Saccule of the Larynx, with both of these spaces extending superiorly, lateral to the Quadrangular Membrane

# Extrinsic Muscles of the Larynx

- These are found between the Larynx and Neighbouring Structures and move the Larynx as a whole up and down the neck (carried out by the Suprahyoid and Infrahyoid Muscles Respectively)
- Lowering the Vocal Pitch can be achieved by depressing the Larynx via the Infrahyoid Muscles and Raising the Vocal Pitch can be achieved by elevating the Larynx via the Suprahyoid Musceles
- Suprahyoid = Digastric, Stylohyoid, Mylohyoid, Geniohyoid and Styloglossus
- Infrahyoid Muscles = Sternohyoid, Thyrohyoid, Omohyoid and Sternothyroid

### Suprahyoid

**Digastric**

- The Posterior Belly of the Digastric is found Deep/Superior to Stylohyoid and the Anterior Belly of Digastric is found Inferior/Superficial to Mylohyoid and Geniohyoid
- The 2 Muscle Bellies of the Digastric and those of Omohyoids are connected by a small intermediate tendon which slides through a small fascial sling
- The Anterior Belly of the Digastric originates from a depression in the Mandible beneath the Chin and passes posteriorly on the Inferior Surface of Mylohyoid
- The Posterior Belly of the Digstric originates from a notch/groove on the medial/inner side of the mastoid process on the cranial base
- The Fibrous Pulley, through which the Intermediate Tendon runs, is attached to the Hyoid Bone, near the Inferior Cornu, and is surrounded by a synovial sheath to minimise friction
- The Anterior Belly of the Digastric is innervated by CN V3 (CN V3 also innervates Mylohyoid in the floor of the Mouth)
- The Posterior Belly of the Digastric is innervated by CN VII
- If the Hyoid Bone is unfixed, the Digastric raises the Hyoid Bone (seen in swallowing)
- If the Hyoid Bone is fixed due to simultaneous activity with the Infrahyoid Muscles, it opens the mouth by lowering the Mandible (Often in combination with the Lateral Pterygoid)

# Innervation of the Larynx

- This is provided by the Superior and Recurrent Laryngeal Nerves from CN X

### Superior Laryngeal Nerve

- This arises from CN X high up in the neck and after descending posterior to the Common Carotids, it divides into Internal and External Branches
- The Internal Laryngeal Nerve pierces the Thyrohyoid Membrane to enter the Larynx and provides sensory innervation to the Mucous Membrane of the Larynx Superior to the Vocal Folds (Vestibule, Epiglottis & Inlet and Piriform Fossa, Aryepiglottic Fold and each Vallecula)
- The External Laryngeal Nerve innervates Cricothyroid

### Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve

- This is a mixed nerve conveying Motor and Sensory Fibres
- This enters the Larynx posterior to the Cricothyroid Joint
- It supplies all of the Intrinsic Laryngeal Muscles except for Cricothyroid
- It also provides sensation of the Mucous Membrane of the Larynx inferior to the Vocal Folds (Laryngeal Atrium, Cricoid Cartilage etc.)
- Terminal Branches of the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve may intermingle with those of the Superior Laryngeal Nerve
- The Cricopharyngeal Part of the Inferior Pharyngeal Constrictor is often supplied by branches of either the Recurrent or External Laryngeal Nerves

![f008-228-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f008-228-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Laryngeal Nerve Lesions

- Lesions of the Vagus Nerve superior to where the Laryngeal Nerves arises causes complete paralysis of the Larynx
- Internal Laryngeal Nerve Lesions causes loss of sensation of the Laryngeal Mucosa superior to the Vocal Folds

![Scannable Document on 9 Nov 2021 at 12_52_57 pm.png](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/Scannable_Document_on_9_Nov_2021_at_12_52_57_pm.png)

**Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve**

- Injury to one Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve paralyses the Ipsilateral Vocal Fold as all Intrinsic Muscles except Cricothyroid are paralysed , causing it to remain Abducted or Adducted whilst causing loss of sensation below the affected vocal fold
- If the Vocal Fold remains adducted, this will lead to Dyspnoea on exertion due to reduced airflow into the Trachea
- If the Vocal Fold remains Abducted, the voice will become weaker and hoarseness but there will be little to no breathlessness
- Bilateral Paralysis of the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerves which results in Adducted Cords leads to both Dyspnoea and Hoarseness and loss of sensation bilaterally below the level of the Vocal Folds

![Vocalcordparalyses.png](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/Vocalcordparalyses.png)

**External Laryngeal Nerve**

- Damage to the External Laryngeal Nerve (E.g via Stroke) causes paralysis of the Cricothyroid
- This causes the Vocal Folds to become less taunt (Relaxed and 'Rubber-Band' Like), making the voice sound hoarse as the vocal cord will not adduct and close properly
- This lack of Adduction of the Paralysed Vocal Fold means that there is incomplete closure of the Vocal Folds, meaning foreign materials can enter the Trachea and Bronchi through the gap between the Normal and Paralysed Vocal Folds, increasing the risk of Lung Infections
- There is also difficulty in singing high notes and the voice tires quickly as the Vocal Cords cannot be kept tense
- Recovery often occurs as the Contralateral Vocal Cord and Musculature adapts to generate the Vocal Cord Tensions needed for normal phonation

# Blood Supply to the Larynx

### Arteries

- This is via the External Carotid Arteries and the Thyrocervical Trunk
- The Superior Laryngeal Artery is a branch of the Superior Thyroid Artery from the External Carotid Artery and supplies the Larynx above the Level of the Vocal Folds
- The Inferior Laryngeal Artery is a branch of the Inferior Thyroid Artery from the Thyrocervical Trunk and supplies the Larynx below the Level of the Vocal Folds

![f008-226-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f008-226-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Veins

- Superior, Middle and Inferior Laryngeal Veins pass back along the Arteries to drain into the Superior, Middle and Inferior Thyroid Veins respectively

![f008-227-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B004%5D%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Larynx%20and%20the%20Supralaryngeal%20da731392eac34f8a95a9a4bad2792219/f008-227-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Lymphatics

- These are organised into 2 systems, one above and one below the Vocal Folds however, these two systems anastomose in the Posterior Wall of the Larynx
- The Lymphatics of the Upper Group pierce the Thyrohyoid Membrane and follow the superior Laryngeal Vessels to the Upper Deep Cervical Nodes (Mostly those found anterior to the Internal Jugular Vein)
- The Lymphatics of the Lower Group pierce the Cricovocal Membrane and drain into the Pretracheal Nodes on the Cricovocal Membrane and into the Paratracheal nodes, found along the course of the Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve

# Source and Filter Theory of Speech Production

- According to the Source and Filter Theory of Speech Production, A source of Acoustic Energy (Air stream from the lungs, shaped my the vocal folds) is modulated by a filter (The Supralaryngeal Vocal Track) into speech elements (Vowels and Consonants)
- To produce different speech elements and sounds, the filter is adjusted via changes in length or shape/diameter of the Supralaryngeal Vocal Tract

# Movements of the Vocal Cords to Produce Speech

- As the pitch of the sound produced increases, frequency of vibrations of the Vocal Folds increases
- When breathing occurs, the Vocal Cords are abducted to allow air flow into the lungs
- When speaking the Vocal Cords are closely adducted
