# [057] Spinal Cord and Brainstem TS

# Spinal Cord TS

- Upper Cervical and Lower Lumbar Cord TS have a large CSA as these are sections through the Brachial and Lumbosacral Plexi, with these regions having lots of Grey and White Matter which contains the cell bodies and axons of axons forming the Brachial and Lumbosacral Plexi
- Thoracic Cord has little Grey or White matter as it receives little sensory input from intercostal nerves (small dorsal horn) and the Intercostal Muscles supplied in these region do not need fine motor control and hence, are innervated by large motor units and few neurons (small motor neurons)
- As you move up the Spinal Cord, White Matter content increases as in more superior spinal levels, there are more axons in Descending Tracts (as fewer axons have descended far enough to leave the Tracts and reach their targets) and Ascending Tracts (as more axons from body segments found inferiorly are found running in ascending sensory tracts to the brain), meaning there must be more white matter through which these run
- Lumbar Regions of the spinal cord also contain lots of Grey Matter (Large Ventral Horns) as a large number of interneurons are found in the Lumbar Levels to form CPGs involved in Locomotion, not found in the upper limbs (hence Ventral Horn Circuitry for Lower Limbs is more complex than that for upper limbs, meaning the Lumbar Level has more Grey Matter than the Cervical Level)

# Spinal Cord Tracts

- Spinocerebellar Tract = Periphery of Lateral White Matter
- Axons from the Ventral Corticospinal Tract usually decussate as they reach the segmental level at which their targets are found to end on the Contralateral Interneurons/Motor Neurons in the Ventral Horn

### Vestibulospinal Tract

- Undecussated Tract that arises from Lateral Vestibular Nucleus
- It is involved in controlling motor neurons that innervate postural muscles to maintain a stable posture

### Reticulospinal Tract

- Arise from the Pontine and Medullary Reticular Formations, found surrounding the Anterior edge of the Ventral Horn
- This can control involuntary and voluntary movements (Voluntary Movements via the Cortico-Reticulospinal Pathway)
- Just lateral to the the bases of the Dorsal and Ventral Horns (where they meet one another), Descending fibres that control the ANS (Notably Pelvic Viscera) are found
- There are axons that surround the entirety of the Grey Matter, forming a boundary between the Grey and the White Matter, forming the Fasciculus proprius, which run bilaterally and up and down the spinal cord to connect different regions of the Spinal Grey Matter to one another
- They are important in reforming new spinal circuitry by establishing new neural pathways between Grey Matter segments if there is injury to the Spinal Cord
- Dorsolateral Fasciculus/Lissauer's Tract is a strip of white matter extending from the Tip of the Superficial Dorsal Horn to the Superficial/Peripheral Edge of the Dorsilateral White Matter
- This is the region of the Spinal Cord where C-Fibres enter the White Matter and bifurcate to project up and down the spinal cord before they enter the Superficial Dorsal Horn alongside unmyelinated fibres from the Brainstem

# Spinal Cord at L1

- A-Delta fibres typically end in Lamina I of the Spinal Cord
- Ventral White Commissure contains decussating second order spinothalamic axons and is very narrow, meaning there is convergence of Spinothalamic Axons here (where they are susceptible to damage)

# Tabes Dorsalis

- When syphilis infects the Spinal Cord, it damages the Dorsal Columns, causing the loss of proprioception and non-discriminatory touch

# Dorsal Spinocerebellar Tract

- Primary Afferents enter the Dorsolateral White matter and Ascend in the Dorsal Columns to project ventrally and end on/give collaterals which end on the Grey Matter in Clarke's Column (Found on Medial Aspect of the Base of the Dorsal Horn)
- Second Order Neurons project laterally from Clarke's Column to the Periphery of the Ipsilateral Lateral White Matter to ascend as the Dorsal Spinocerebellar Tracts
- The Dorsal Spinocerebellar Tract then enters the Cerebellum via the Ipsilateral Inferior Cerebellar Peduncle to synapse within the Cerebellum
- The Dorsal Spinocerebellar Tract receives proprioception from the Ipsilateral Body as the Cerebellar Hemispheres control movement of the Ipsilateral Body due to the the Double Decussation of Cerebellar and Corticospinal Fibres
- These involve large diameter neurons and hence, this is a fast conduction pathway, which allows for rapid feedback of proprioceptive information into the Cerebellum to correct movements rapidly
- The Ventral Spinocerebellar Tracts receive contralateral second order fibres that have decussated through the Spinal Grey and ascend through the Brain stem to enter the Cerebellum via the Superior Cerebellar Peduncle.
- The Ventral Spinocerebellar Tract also provides input to the Ipsilateral Cerebellar Hemisphere as the fibres decussate once at the Ventral White Commissure of the segmental level that they enter the Spinal Cord and in the Midbrain as they enter the Superior Cerebellar Peduncle

# Spinothalamic Tract

- Spinothalamic Afferents from the Upper Limb tend to be found anteriorly and medially in the Spinothalmic Tract whereas Afferents from the Lower Limb tend to be found more posterior and laterally
- Heat Pain ascends more posteriorly in the Spinothalamic Tract whereas Sharp Pain ascends more ventrally

# Caudal Medulla

- Spinal Nucleus of CN V is C-shaped and  continuously inferiorly with the Superficial Dorsal Horn

---

# Dorsolateral Medullary Syndrome

Damages:

1. Spinal CN V Nucleus - Pain and Temperature from Ipsilateral Face, Nasal Cavity and Cornea
2. Spinothalamic Tract - Pain and Temperature from Contralateral Body

# Medulloblastoma

- Malignant Tumour commonly found in Children which can be quite effectively treated
- It commonly arises in the Vermis and Nodule (Vestibulocerebellum), which disrupts Vestibular Control (Posture and Balance) and projects anteriorly to the Medulla
- As it often spans the gap between the Medulla and Cerebellum, it blocks the Median Aperture, which causes Hydrocephalus

# Acoustic Neuroma/Vestibular Schwannoma

- Benign Tumour of the Schwann Cells, which is commonly found on the Vestibular Component of CN VIII
- It can be easily treated but often grows into and occupies large amounts of the Posterior Cranial Fossa, meaning it can damage the Cerebellum and Brainstem if not treated effectively/rapidly
- As CN VII and VIII both enter the Internal Acoustic Meatus, Acoustic Neuromas often compress and damage CN VII, causing the Sx of Facial Nerve Palsy (Ipsilateral Facial Paralysis/Drooping) and Deafness (Sensorineural Hearing Loss)

# Parkinson's Disease

- Originates in the Dorsal Nucleus of the Vagus → Locus Cereleus → Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta
- It produces clinical disease/Sx when it begins to affect the SNc
