# [018] An Introduction to Neurons and the Action Potential

# Anatomy of a Neuron

- (This is most like a motor neuron) except the Dendritic spines (Small projections from Dendrites), and oligodendrocytes which are more commonly found in excitatory neurons in the brain
- Interneurons and sensory neurons are quite diverse in their anatomy
- The Axon Hilock is the trigger zone where all the Inputs fed into Dendrites is integrated and summated and if the net effect of these inputs on Vm provides sufficient depolarisation to cross the Threshold for the Opening of Voltage-Gated Na⁺ Channels, this will trigger an AP
- Action Potentials propagate unidirectionally down the Axon, usually from Dendrite/Cell Body to Axon Terminals/Synapses

### Neuronal Structures and Functions

**Soma**

- This is the cell body of neurons
- It contains the nucleus and masses of machinery to make proteins (This is made visible by Nissl stain)
- It also receives some input from Synapses and processes this input

**Axon**

- It is usually uniform in diameter (unlike Dendrites which are tapered, decreasing in diameter as you move distally down the Dendrite)
- To form synapses with various structures, collaterals/axonal branches tend to arise at right angles to the Axon
- There is almost always only axon one per neuron but there are multiple dendrites per neuron
- It transmits signals towards synapses (Presynaptic Axon Terminal from the Soma

**Dendrite**

- Tend to be thin projections from the Soma but are specific to different neurons, having many different shapes depending on type of neuron (these can be used to identify the neuron)
- Receives most of information from many synapses, containing postsynaptic specialisations
- Integrates incoming signals towards cell body, where the input is processed

**Presynaptic Terminal**

- These are terminals found at the distal end of the Axon, loaded with Synaptic Vesicles
- This is the output region of the Neuron which stimulates a postsynaptic Membrane with which it is associated with at synapses

# Types of Neurons

- There are many different types of Neurons
- Broadly, there are ‘excitatory’ neurons – or ‘projection neurons’
- These are mainly Glutamaturgic in the brain and depolarise the postsynaptic membrane
- A few excitatory neurons are cholinergic (e.g. motor neurons) or use noradrenaline (e.g. sympathetic neurons)
- Inhibitory neurons seem to be more diverse in neurotransmitter
- These neurons are GABAergic, but also use serotonin, peptides and other transmitters
- These hyperpolarise the Postsynaptic Membrane
- By some estimates ~10,000 types of neuron in human brain

# Introduction to Action Potentials and the Resting Potential

### Action Potential

- Information is coded in the form of Action Potentials
- Action potentials rely on ionic gradients across the membranes of cells established by unequal [Ion] across the cell membrane
- Most cells pump Na⁺ out, and as Na⁺ is positively charged, this unequal Na⁺ distribution across the cell membrane leaves the inside of the cell (Where [Na⁺] is lower) more negative in comparison to outside the cell
- This can about as in the cells of the Aquatic Evolutionary Ancestor, it was necessary to pump out the massive quantities of NaCl extracted from seawater in order to create room in the cell for DNA and other cellular proteins and ultrastructures
- Around -70 mV is a typical Vm for a neuron

![Screenshot 2021-11-22 at 10.55.48.png](%5B018%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Neurons%20and%20the%20Action%20Po%20b7b194a34ddd4ddc8d30a8847a1d90d7/Screenshot_2021-11-22_at_10.55.48.png)

- Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase known as the Na⁺/K⁺ pump is continuously active in all cells but at an extremely high rate in neurons to pump Na⁺ out of the cell against its concentration gradient
- Whilst it does mediate active K⁺ influx, it influxes 2K⁺ for each 3Na⁺ that it effluxes, causing net movement of +ve charge out of the cell (Maintains Hyperpolarised Vm)
- As this is an active process, it uses significant amounts of ATP (It makes a significant contribution to Basal Metabolic Rate) in order to set up and maintain ionic gradients at ‘rest’ and establish the resting potential of the cell

![Screenshot 2021-11-22 at 10.59.31.png](%5B018%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Neurons%20and%20the%20Action%20Po%20b7b194a34ddd4ddc8d30a8847a1d90d7/Screenshot_2021-11-22_at_10.59.31.png)

- The constant active Na⁺ efflux and K⁺ influx means that the distribution/concentration of these ions is quite different inside and outside the cell, namely [Na⁺] is greater extracellularly and [K⁺] is greater intracellularly
- This establish diffusion/electrochemical gradients that facilitate the movement of ions across the cell membrane to equalise their concentration and balance out the charges on either side of the cell membrane

# Determinants of Extracellular and Intracellular Ion Concentration

- As Intracellular [K⁺] >> Extracellular [K⁺] due to the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase, there is a large concentration gradient driving K⁺ efflux
- As the cell is polarised (negative Vm) due to Na⁺ efflux and the accumulation of organic anions (E.g DNA and Proteins), there is an electrical gradient that drives K⁺ Influx towards this area of net negativity
- These opposing forces mean that movements of K⁺ ions down its chemical and electrical gradients are in a balance at negative potentials (due to the large electrostatic attraction provided by Intracellular Organic Anions)

![Screenshot 2021-11-22 at 11.03.31.png](%5B018%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Neurons%20and%20the%20Action%20Po%20b7b194a34ddd4ddc8d30a8847a1d90d7/Screenshot_2021-11-22_at_11.03.31.png)

- This balance between opposing Electrostatic and Concentration Gradients (Electrochemical Gradient) and the magnitude of this can be determined via the Nernst Equation
- $E=\frac{RT}{EZ}ln\frac{Co}{Ci}$
- E = The Membrane Potential at which the ion will be in equilibrium (Chemical Gradient = Electrical Gradient)
- Co = [Ion] Outside, Ci = [Ion] Inside and T = Temperature (Kelvin)
- R = Universal Gas Constant (8.314 J K⁻¹)
- z = Charge of the Ion
- F = Faraday's Constant (2.3x10⁶)
- If Co>Ci, there will be influx of the ion until there is sufficient charge intracellularly to mediate efflux of the Ion - When this is achieved, the Ion is at Equilibrium
- The Nernst Potential tells you the Vm at which there is no net ion movement across the cell membrane (Ion Efflux = Ion Influx).
- If the cell is completely permeability to only one ion, Vm will be equal to the Nernst Potential of that Ion
- This means that the ions will tend to flow in the direction that will change the Vm to the Nernst Potential of that ion (E.g If Vm = -ve and Nernst = +ve, that ion will flow into the Cell if the Membrane is freely permeable)
- As the difference between Veq and Vm decreases, there is a reduced net movement of ions across the membrane (as the membrane potential established from the ion's movement across membranes is close to equilibrium)

| Ion | Nernst Potential |
| --- | --- |
| Cl⁻ | -70 mV |
| K⁺ | -90 mV |
| Na⁺ | +60 mV |
| Ca²⁺ | +130 mV |
- These Nernst Potentials do differ depending on the Neuron being considered
- At equilibrium, the rate of ion efflux = rate of ion influx - Equilibrium does NOT mean the ions are not moving.
- The GHK equation adds together the Nernst calculations for all the major ions that the cell membrane is permeable to, to find an overall ‘resting’ potential – in neurons, this is around -70 mV

![Screenshot 2021-11-22 at 11.18.06.png](%5B018%5D%20An%20Introduction%20to%20Neurons%20and%20the%20Action%20Po%20b7b194a34ddd4ddc8d30a8847a1d90d7/Screenshot_2021-11-22_at_11.18.06.png)

- [Ca²⁺] Intracellularly <<< [Ca²⁺] Extracellular
- [Cl⁻] Extracellularly > [Cl⁻] Intracellularly
- At the resting potential for the Neuron, the Electrochemical Gradient for Na⁺ favours significant Na⁺ Influx and that for K⁺ favours minor K⁺ efflux
- As the Cell depolarises K⁺ efflux increases Na⁺ influx decreases (eventually, when significantly depolarised, Na⁺ will begin to Efflux)
- As the Cell Hyperpolarises/Repolarises, Na⁺ influx increases and K⁺ efflux decreases (eventually, when significantly repolarised, K⁺ will begin to Influx)
- At rest, the main conductance of the cell membrane is the K⁺ channel, with a tiny bit of Na⁺ and other ion leakage/movement occurring into the Neuron
- This means the cell is predominantly permeable to K⁺ and much less significantly to Na⁺ and other ions
- The Na⁺/K⁺ Pump is continuously active to pump these ions against their electrochemical gradients to maintain Na⁺ and K⁺ electrochemical gradients across the cell membrane

# Action Potentials and Their Phases

- Because the inside of a cell is negative (Around -70 mV), and the Nernst equilibrium for Na⁺ is positive (Around +40 mV) when Na⁺ channels
open (Selective and Temporary increases in Na⁺ permeability/Conductance), Na⁺ ions (in an attempt to bring Vm closer to its Veq) influx down both electrical and chemical gradients (the latter established by Active Na⁺ efflux via the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase) which causes rapid depolarisation and AP generation

### Phases of the Action Potential

1. Phase 1- This is the ‘Resting’ potential – This is established by the balance of K⁺ efflux across the cell membrane via leak channels and minor leaks of other ions, including Na⁺ into the cell, but the Vm is near K⁺ reversal potential (K⁺ Nernst Potential)
2. Phase 2- There is slight depolarisation (due to some neurotransmitter binding to dendrites) due to the opening of a few Na⁺ channels, causing some Na⁺ to enter the cell membrane to start to depolarise the cell membrane
- If the depolarisation triggered by the neurotransmitter is not enough to pass the Threshold for Na⁺ Channel activation, then the Neuron will not depolarise and it will return to its Resting Potential
1. Phase 3- The Vm for the Neuron becomes more positive and if it crosses the threshold for Na⁺ channel activation, causing nearby Voltage Gated Na⁺ channels to open very quickly in a +ve feedback loop. This causes Na⁺ influx down Electrical and Chemical Gradients, rapidly depolarising the cell membrane. This causes Vm to quickly reach the Nernst Potential for Na⁺ as all the Open Na⁺ Channels means the cell membrane is completely permeable to Na⁺
2. Phase 4- Na⁺ channels are rapidly inactivated (to ensure that the cell membrane does not become so depolarised that the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase cannot restore Resting Potential quickly enough) when the peak depolarisation is achieved and K⁺ channels open. 
- This reduces Na⁺ influx and increases K⁺ efflux whilst the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase, repolarising the cell membrane to bring the Vm of the Cell away from the Nernst/Reversal Potential of Na⁺ and towards that of K⁺ (Makes Vm more -ve).
1. Phase 5- Na⁺ channels are completely inactivated and membrane continues to hyperpolarise (below resting potential) via K⁺ Efflux as it approaches the Nernst/Reversal Potential of K⁺
- The Vm for the Neuron is slightly more positive than the K⁺ Nernst Potential as the membrane is slightly permeable to other ions at rest, so the slight leak of other Cations into the cell pulls Vm away from Veq of K⁺
- The Membrane is Hyperpolarised below the Resting Potential as the Inactivation of Na⁺ Channels causes Na⁺ Leak Channels to also be inactivated, preventing any Na⁺ Leakage into the Neuron, causing Vm to become more negative (closer to the Nernst Potential for K⁺)
- The 'Overshoot'/Hyperpolarisation of the Neuron where Vm < Resting Vm creates the Absolute Refractory Period, where no other APs can be generated as Na⁺ Channels are inactivated and cannot be open, preventing Na⁺ influx that mediates depolarisation and AP generation
1. The transition of Na⁺ Channels from Inactivated to closed allows for minor Na⁺ leak to occur into the cell, which makes the Vm more positive from the Hyperpolarised Vm near Veq for K⁺ back to the Resting Potential

# Mutations and Action Potentials

- Mutations in Na⁺ channels can lead to epilepsy via different routes
- When there is decreased expression of the Na⁺ channels that are already found in large numbers in Inhibitory interneurons is reduced (Loss Of Function), there is reduced frequency of Inhibitory Signalling/AP Generation, causing inhibition by Inhibitory Interneurons to be lost which leads to the severe epilepsy seen in Dravet Syndrome
- When there is increased expression of the Na⁺ channels that are already found in large numbers in excitatory neurons (Gain Of Function) this also leads to epilepsy (as there is increased depolarising potential of the neuron, leading to too much excitatory activity in the brain as Nerves depolarise more often than they should)
- Mutations in some K⁺ channels lead to hyperexcitable motor neurons (as there is reduced K⁺ efflux in the AP Cycle and hence, defective repolarisation of Neurons so Vm is more positive)
- This means that these Motor Neurons more frequently depolarise, leading to over active muscles (Myotonia) whilst mutations in CNS to K⁺ channels can lead to epilepsy (neurons become hyperexcitable, causing them to fire more frequently, causing excitatory activity in the CNS to increase)

# Medicine and Action Potentials

- Local anaesthetics - These block  Na⁺ channels to cause Neurons to become Hypoexcitable, blocking AP generation and hence, reducing Nociceptive Signalling
- Anti-epileptics - These are often Na⁺ Channel Blockers
- TTX - This blocks Na⁺ Channels, reducing AP generation within Neurons (Neurons become hypoexcitable) which reduce Excitatory Signalling between nerves
- Dendrotoxin - Very potent  K⁺ Channel blocker, causing neurons to become Hyperexcitable
- Oubain (ATPase) - Blocks ATPase, preventing the generation of the Na⁺ and K⁺ Electrochemical Gradients (as no Chemical Gradient is established), preventing AP generation here
