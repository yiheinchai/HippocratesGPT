# [050] Vision - Central Visual Pathways 2

# Visual System is a Feature Detector

- Wavelength: colour
- Contrast: edges
- Spatial frequency: size
- Retina and visual system detect differences in light intensity, but not absolute value of light intensity.
- This means that the context in which an object is placed (E.g its background) can alter how bright or dark the colour appears (E.g on a Lighter Background, an object often appears darker but on a darker background, an object often appears lighter)
- These 3 Features are combined into 3 Parallel Streams of Visual Information processing, colour, shape and motion respectively

# Wavelength and Colour

- P cells: colour-opponent cells, meaning they are excited by a central colour but inhibited by a surround colour.
- RF of P Ganglion Cell = : red on centre, green off surround (R⁺G⁻).
- This means that the firing rate of the P Ganglion Cell is highest when just the centre of the RF is illuminated with Red Light
- If the entire RF (Centre and Surround) is illuminated with red light, the Firing Rate of the P Ganglion Cell is higher than its resting frequency but lower than when just the centre of the RF is illuminated
- If Red light is shone on the centre RF and Green Light is shone on the Surround RF, the P Ganglion Cell firing rate is reduced due to strong inhibition of P Ganglion Cells by the Green Light stimulating the Surround RG
- Most are Red-Green but some cells classed as blue on and yellow off (B⁺Y⁻) - These are double opponent cells.

# Contrast and Spacial Frequency

- Different spatial wavelength detected by retinal ganglion cells (RGC) which have different receptive field sizes across the Retina
- Different RGC select for different (coarse/general edges or fine/detailed edges) features of contrast/edges in a visual scene based on whether their RF is large or small, producing different outputs to the same input.
- When these outputs converge onto V1, this allows for a complete image of the size/spacial Frequency and Contour/Edges to be produced
- Contrast edge detected:
1. White: large responses produced by on, centre retinal ganglion cells.
2. Black: large responses produced by off, centre retinal ganglion cells.
- Strong Contrast Edges between objects of 2 distinctly different colours produces a superficial Black Line, immediately adjacent to a deeper White Line, produced by the activation of On and Off Centre Retinal Ganglion Cells
- This pairing produces a sharp demarcation of the edges of objects, to allow contrast/edges to be detected

# Primary Visual Cortex V1

- Simple and Complex Cells have defined RFs, with edges and bars being the stimuli for both
- Simple cells: These are sensitive to orientation and direction selective and hence, detect precise stimulus location and position in space
- This sensitivity is produced as the RF of the Simple Cell has a narrow On Region and a wide Off Region, which usually run parallel to the Long Axis of the RF
- When the Bar/Edge is running parallel to the Long Edge of the Simple Cell RF through its centre, the Simple Cell fires very rapidly as the Bar is running through the On Centre but not the Off Centre (no/little Inhibition of the Simple Cell)
- When the Bar/Edge is running parallel to the Long Edge of the Simple Cell RF but through the Surround Area or not running parallel to the RF Long Edge, there is stimulation of Off Centre as well as potentially On Centre Cells (for Orientational Selectivity respectively), producing profound Inhibition of Simple Cell which reduces Firing Rate significantly
- This produces Directional and Orientational Selectivity respectively
- Complex cells: These are orientationally selective but not directionally Selective
- The position of stimulus on the RF is not as important as it is for Simple Cells as their RF contains no fixed on or off areas.
- They fire continuously while a bar
(with correct orientation, usually parallel to the Long Axis of the RF) is translated along the width of the RF
- When the Bar/Edge is not in the correct orientation required to stimulate the Complex Cell, there is limited stimulation of the cell, producing a low firing rate

- End-inhibited cells (hypercomplex cells/end-stopped cells)
- These contain a short central excitatory regions are flanked/surrounded by inhibitory regions with same orientation selectivity.
- A short/curved line with the correct orientation that runs in the Excitatory Region does not extend into inhibitory regions of the RF or a curved line will excite these neurons.
- A long line, in the correct orientation, extending far into inhibitory regions (they can be partially in the excitatory region or not) will inhibit these cells
- Together these 3 cell types allow visual system to analyse position and orientation of edges, line segments etc. and thus define shape of objects.

# Where does Visual Information go from V1

- 2 main streams: dorsal and ventral
stream, with different functions.

**Extrastriate Cortical Regions:**

- [Figure A] Lateral view of macaque brain with sulci partially opened to expose areas within them.
- Shown are rough outlines of main visual areas, which take up all of occipital cortex and much of parietal and temporal cortex.
- [Figure B] Partial diagram of connections between visual areas.
- Emphasis is placed on hierarchical organisation of connections, with neurons computing more complex aspects of vision found more anteriorly/distally in the streams as more modes of Visual Information are integrated together to eventually produce a single image
- There is also partially segregated P parvocellular and M magnocellular pathways due to connections between various regions involved in the Visual Streams to allow for effective information convergence and combination to produce a more complex visual image moving distally along the Visual Pathways.
- The exact detail and extent of these connections is still relatively unknown
- Ventral stream: V1 → V2 → V3 → V4 → IT (inferior temporal gyrus)
- Mostly parvocellular and hence, conveys lots of colour visual information
- Lesions in this stream show deficits in object recognition.
- Gives information about what object is.
- Dorsal stream: V1 → V2 → MT (middle temporal gyrus) → MST (medial superior temporal area)
- Mostly magnocellular and hence, conveys lots of visual information regarding contrast and motion.
- Lesions in this stream show deficits in visual guided behaviour and motion vision.
- Gives information about where object is.
- For both these streams, features that neurons respond to become more and more complex as you move anteriorly down these streams, further away from V1.
- In V1, some neurons are sensitive to direction of motion (Simple, Complex and Hypercomplex Cells), but optimal speed of stimulus will vary with other features of stimulus (e.g. contrast).
- In MT and MST, neurons integrate over larger areas and they can be sensitive to motion of complex objects rather than an isolated feature.

# Lesions in the Extrastriate Cortex

- These can have varied and severe consequences, both depending on the localisation of the lesion in the Extrastriate Cortex but also between individuals
- Insight into the function of extra striate cortex is gained by a variety of methods:
1. Electrophysiological studies using brain probes on animal models and patients - Their invasiveness means they are mainly carried out in animals vs humans, used in humans in limited situations (E.g Seizure Activity or Localisation of Tumours).
2. Anatomy and histology, tracer studies etc. - This provides information on the composition of the various pathways of Visual Information through the Brain (Areas involved and specific Visual Tracts)
3. Imaging studies (fMRI, PET etc.) in humans and animal models - This is commonly done on humans as it is non-invasive.
4. Patient case histories accompanied by imaging studies or post mortem histology to identify the deficits produced by pathology in specific regions of the brain

### Associative Visual Agnosia (AVA)

- Asterisks indicate patient’s copies.
- This can be Dx by giving Px images and asking them to draw them (ensuring that they have good general vision and fine motor skills to exclude other visual or motor pathologies)
- Patients very often copy these images line by line and very slow, despite no apparent fine motor or visual problems.
- Pictures that a patient with AVA did not recognise/identify objects but was able to copy them.
- This is caused by lesions are in occipital and temporal cortices, mainly bilaterally

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 13.41.15.png](%5B050%5D%20Vision%20-%20Central%20Visual%20Pathways%202%20eb67024935224f4fac78d90c2fc35158/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_13.41.15.png)

- [Top brain image] Region of brain (in shading) within which large bilateral or right-sided lesions cause associative visual agnosia.
- This mainly involves the Inferior and Middle Temporal Gyri, which are the Cortical End points of the Ventral Stream of Visual Information, important in identifying objects
- [Bottom brain image] Region in macaque monkey (in shading) within which bilateral lesions cause visual discrimination and recognition deficits which are analogous to visual agnosic syndromes in humans.

### Optic Ataxia

- This is caused by lesions in parietal cortex.
- Patients have difficulty making visually guided arm movements.
- Problems arise for movement in contralesional visual field, involving the contralateral limb, with visually guided movements often being accurate on the Ipsilesional Visual Field/Limb.
- This is usually diagnosed by cutting a slit into a disc and asking the Px whether they can identify the slit (where it is located) and its orientation, often by placing their hand through the slit - In Px with Optic Ataxia, they are unable to do this correctly and cannot place their hand through the slit
- If the hand is in the correct orientation but wrong position/direction, this can selectively identify directional errors whilst if the hand is in the correct position/direction but in the wrong orientation, this can selectively identify orientational errors

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 13.42.25.png](%5B050%5D%20Vision%20-%20Central%20Visual%20Pathways%202%20eb67024935224f4fac78d90c2fc35158/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_13.42.25.png)

### Constructional Apraxia

- Patients with parietal lobe injury make gross errors when attempting to arrange matchsticks to resemble a visible model with shape of a 4- pointed start, despite having in tact fine motor skills.
- Cases are labelled R or L to indicate injury in right or left hemisphere.
- Here visuospatial cognition is impaired (Awareness of the position and orientation of objects in space, in relation to one another)
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 13.43.12.png](%5B050%5D%20Vision%20-%20Central%20Visual%20Pathways%202%20eb67024935224f4fac78d90c2fc35158/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_13.43.12.png)
    

### Hemispacial Neglect

- This is different to Homonymous Hemianopia as in Homonymous Hemianopia, Half of the Visual Field is absent so they cannot see anything in that visual field whereas in Hemispacial Neglect, the Px's Visual Fields are not affected, meaning they can see both sides of the object but can only consciously identify one side
- This is unilateral object-centred neglect, where the Visual Information from the Visual Fields are conducted to V1 but lesions means this visual information cannot reach the Cortical Areas of the Brain responsible for the Conscious Awareness of Visual Information.
- When asked to copy 2 drawings on left, patient makes 2 copies on right.
- Detail is omitted from left half of each object rather than from left half of drawing.
- Occurs after parietal cortex lesions, often strokes.
- Mostly right parietal lesions.
- Neglect will occur in the Contralesional Visual Field

### Prosopagnosia

- Failure to recognise familiar faces.
- People cannot recognise parents or spouses by their face, but can recognise their voice, smell and even gait and overall body shape or posture.
- This is due to lesions in lingual and fusiform gyri.
