# [059] Biological Basis of Neurodegeneration 1

# Neurodegeneration

- Basal ganglia receive inputs from cerebral cortex and thalamus.
- Regions of basal ganglia receiving primary inputs: caudate nucleus, putamen and nucleus accumbens (Ventral Aspect of Caudate Nucleus).
- This is collectively referred to as striatum (STR).
- Regions of basal ganglia that connect with other regions of basal ganglia (intrinsic nuclei): globus pallidus (external segment) (GPe), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc).
- Regions of basal ganglia that provide outflow of information from basal ganglia (outputs): globus pallidus (internal segment) (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr).
- These outputs go to thalamic nuclei (regions of thalamus important in connections with frontal cortical regions to control motor function) and other targets (superior colliculus (SC), reticular formation (RF), pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and habenula (HBN)).
- This circuitry allows Cortical Input to be processed by the Basal Ganglia and fed back into Motor Regions of the Cerebral Cortex where it can project to influence movement and other functions

- The Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta gives rise to the Nigrostrial Pathway that projects to both types of Neurons in the Striatum that give rise to the Direct and Indirect Pathways to modulate their activity
- 97% of cells within striatum are GABAergic projection cells of striatum which form the Direct and Indirect Pathway, with this 97% split evenly between both neuron types.
- These neurons that give rise to the Direct and Indirect Pathways are called Striatal Medium Spiny Neurons (MSN)
- In these Cells, many dendrites, with small dendritic spines present on these dendrites, project from the Soma

- Cortical Nerve Terminals make asymmetric contracts (Excitatory/Glutamatergic) with the Head of the Dendritic Spine on MSNs
- At the Base of the Dendritic Spines, Nerve Terminals containing Tyrosine Hydroxylase are found, forming Dopaminergic Synapses with D1/2 Receptors here which regulate the ability of the Distal Glutamatergic Synapse to stimulate the MSN
- Each Nigrostriatal Neuron has very long axons which form 100,000s Dopaminergic Synapses with the Bases of the Dendritic Spines to tightly modulate the stimulation of Striatal Neurons, with a single DA neuron controlling large areas of the Striatum

# Statistics

- Principal afferent inputs to basal ganglia are from cerebral cortex and thalamus: together they form 85% of synapses in striatum.
- These afferents use glutamate as a transmitter and form asymmetric synapses (excitatory Grey Type 1, small  round vesicles).
- Dendrites are covered with dendritic spines: each MSN (medium spiny neuron) has 15,000 dendritic spines.
- Neurons that give rise to the Indirect and direct pathways are mixed in the striatum: not distinct laminae.

# Huntintgton's Disease

### Symptoms

- Hyperkinetic disorder: too much movement (often writhing movements, notably of the Upper Limbs)
- Originally characterised as having 3 Phases:
1. Early Psychiatric Phase (Hard to Define)
2. Hyperkinesic Phase (Majority of Disease)
3. Subcortical Dementia

### **Pathology**

- Characterised as Autosomal Dominant Inheritance as it does not skip a generation and is found in both men and females in similar proportions
- CT scan: enlargement of anterior horns of lateral ventricles, as striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) which form the Lateral Borders of the Anterior Horn degenerate.

- Initial Clinical Diseases do not manifest as Macroscopic Changes in the Size of the Striatum, with more pronounced motor Sx becoming evident as Macroscopic Striatal Degeneration
- Macroscopic Degeneration of the Striatum causes the Internal Capsule and Basal Ganglia to become more concave (Bends Laterally vs Medially)

### Huntingtin Protein

- HD gene (IT15) codes for ‚ÄòHuntingtin‚Äô protein and is found at the tip of the Upper Arm of Chromosome 4.
- mRNA is spliced from 67 exons (Large Gene) which encodes a 350 Kd protein ubiquitously expressed in all tissues with no known function.
- It is 3,144 amino acids long.
- Within HD gene, there are polymorphic (naturally variable) CAG repeats (which coding for glutamine).
- Normal people have 17-34 CAG repeats, preclinical symptoms have 34-39, those with > 40 develop Huntington‚Äôs at about 50 years of age, and those with > 70 develop Huntington‚Äôs before 20 (Juvenile onset)
- Those with the number of CAG repeats corresponding to Preclinical Huntington‚Äôs Disease are unlikely to develop Huntington‚Äôs Disease within their Lifetime but are likely to have offspring who have more CAG Repeats and hence, will develop Huntington‚Äôs Disease
- Generally, in individuals with the defect in the HD gene that causes Huntington‚Äôs Disease, offspring seem to have increasingly more CAG repeats, which leads to earlier onset of Huntington‚Äôs Disease
- However, this is predictive only whilst the mean CAG Repeat number is directly correlated with earlier disease onset, the range of CAG Repeats seen in individuals with Juvenile, Typical and Late Onset overlap significantly so CAG Repeats of the same number can be found in individuals with a wide range of Onset Points of Huntington‚Äôs Disease (Predictive of Onset for a Population but not on an individual level)

# Distinguishing Direct and Indirect Pathway

- The different neurons that give rise to the Indirect and Direct Pathway express different neuropeptides which can be detected using markers.
- Substance P and Dynorphin: marker in direct pathway.
- Encephalin: marker in indirect pathway.
- There is preferential degeneration of indirect pathway before involvement of direct pathway.
- Depletion of Encephalin is shown in all HD patients, whereas substance P depletion is only seen in older patients with more progressive stages of the Disease, indicating Preferential Destruction of the Neurons of the Indirect Pathway before those of the Direct Pathway.
- At early stages, there is inappropriate activity of motor programmes.
- This is due to degeneration of indirect pathway, which decreases Thalamic Inhibition to promote movement (Increased Motor Cortex stimulation) to produce Hyperkinesia (Direct > Indirect Pathway).
- At end stage disease (John Paul Vonsattel Stage 4), patients can be akinetic (loss of movement), bradykinetic (slowness of movement).
- This is due to progressive degeneration of direct pathway, which inhibits movement due to a lack of excitatory drive to the Thalamus from the Basal Ganglia and hence, Motor Cortical Areas (Loss of all Striatal Neurons prevents output to the Thalamus via the Basal Ganglia).

# Parkinson's Disease

### **Symptoms**

- Resting tremor
- Bradykinesia
- Masked facies: doesn‚Äôt smile or frown.
- Cog-wheel rigidity
- Stopped Posture
- Shuffling Gait

### **Pathology**

- Dopaminergic Neurons in the Substantia nigra pars compacta which form the Nigrostrial Tract degenerate.
- Lewy bodies can also be found within the DA Neurons of the SNc in Parkinson‚Äôs Px
- These Large round cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, made up of ùõº synuclein - appear darkly staining/Eosinophilic and relatively amorphous.
- Under EM, they have a very darkly staining core that stains more lightly as you move peripherally through the Lewy Body

![Screenshot 2021-12-17 at 13.11.04.png](%5B059%5D%20Biological%20Basis%20of%20Neurodegeneration%201%209f441de31c704f609e33b6b20fc21475/Screenshot_2021-12-17_at_13.11.04.png)

- DA neurons are found within localised clusters in the SNc, which allows for further subvision of the SNc into Ventral Medial, Intermediate and Lateral Tiers, Dorsal Medial and Lateral and the Pars Lateralis (AKA 3 Dorsal and 3 Ventral Tiers)
- In Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, there seems to be preferential DA neuronal death in the Ventrolateral Tier (and to a lesser extent, Ventromedial Tier) of the SNc
- In Normal Ageing, there seems to preferential loss of DA Neurons in the Dorsal Tiers of the SNc, with reduced loss of DA Neurons in the Ventral Tier of the SNc
- This opposite pattern of degeneration of the Ventral and Dorsal Tiers in Parkinson‚Äôs Disease shows that Parkinson‚Äôs Disease is not an accelerated form of Ageing
- Whilst Parkinson‚Äôs Disease shows preferential degeneration of the Ventral Tier of the SNc, the most heavily pigmented DA neurons are found in the Dorsal Tiers of the SNc, so whilst Degeneration of the Dorsal Tiers in normal ageing may be due to melanisation of cells in the Dorsal Tiers, this is unlikely to be the case in the less pigmented ventral tiers which degenerate in Parkinson‚Äôs Disease
- In Px with Incidental Lewy Body Disorders (Px with Lewy Bodies but no Sx of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease), there seems to be preferential degeneration of the Ventrolateral Tier of the Substantia Nigra

![Screenshot 2021-12-17 at 13.20.38.png](%5B059%5D%20Biological%20Basis%20of%20Neurodegeneration%201%209f441de31c704f609e33b6b20fc21475/Screenshot_2021-12-17_at_13.20.38.png)

### **Synuclein Protein**

- For 90% of Px with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, it is an idiopathic disease but for the remaining 10%, it is an Autosomal Dominant disorder, with Parkinson‚Äôs in some of these Px being caused by a mutation in the SNCA Gene impacting ùõº-Synuclein Expression
- SNCA gene (hCh4) codes for ùõº-synuclein protein found in the Upper Aspect of the Lower Arm of Chromosome 4.
- mRNA spliced from exons.
- 140 amino acid proteins containing 7 n terminal repeats of 11 amino acids.
- 6 missense mutations and SNCA Gene duplication or gene triplication give rise to familial forms of PD (MSA/multiple system atrophy or DLB/Dementia with Lewy bodies)).
- GWAS (genome-wide association data) identified sequence variation in regulatory region of SNCA as most important genetic risk factor for idiopathic PD.

### Treatment

- Apomorphine: not used clinically (as it produces abscesses at site of
subcutaneous injection) and is only used experimentally in Px that are not responding well to L-DOPA (Lots of On-Off Swings/Side Effects etc.).
- D1/D2 receptor agonist.
- 10 minutes post 4 mg injection, dopamine pathways appear to be restored, with significantly reduced Parkinson‚Äôs Sx.
- In Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, reduced activity of the Indirect Pathway seems to lead to increased Activity of the Subthalamic Nucleus, which increases inhibitory drive from the GPi and hence, produced increased inhibition of the Thalamus and Supplementary Motor Area, producing Bradykinesia
- When Dopamine is removed from the Basal Ganglia, the Subthalamic Nucleus increases in its firing rate during phases where it is active, which causes the GPe to become Phasically active (Slightly out of sync with the Phasic Activity of the STN) instead of Tonically Active

![Screenshot 2021-12-17 at 13.46.04.png](%5B059%5D%20Biological%20Basis%20of%20Neurodegeneration%201%209f441de31c704f609e33b6b20fc21475/Screenshot_2021-12-17_at_13.46.04.png)

- Inhibiting STN: either lesioning STN or using electrodes to fire at a high frequency on STN to inhibit the Phasic Firing of the STN, inhibiting the indirect pathway to reduces the Sx of Parkinson‚Äôs Diseases.
- However, where the D1 and D2 Striatal MSN which give rise to the Direct and Indirect Pathways are not found in separate laminae (found interspersed in the Striatum), it is difficult to directly stimulate the Direct or Indirect Pathway individually using Electrodes
- However, by expressing the channel Rhodopsin Gene adjacent to the D1 Receptor Promotor Sequence (so both genes are controlled by the same genetic elements), there will be selective expression of Channel Rhodopsin in D1-Expressing Neurons that give rise to the Direct Pathway
- Therefore, by inserting Monofilament Cables into the Striatum of an organism that is selectively expressing Channel Rhodopsin in the Direct Pathway, the cable can enter the Rhodopsin Channel to selectively activate the Direct Pathway to reduce Parkinson‚Äôs Sx here

# Conclusion

- Basal ganglia are important circuits for control of complex motor programmes.
- Parkinson‚Äôs disease is a good example of a hypo-kinetic disorder, where loss of dopaminergic nigro-striatal projection leads to bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and akinesia.
- Huntington‚Äôs disease is initially a hyper kinetic disorder resulting from progressive degeneration of striatal projection neurons, leading to a functional imbalance in output signal of basal ganglia.
- A model that describes neuroanatomical and functional interactions that are found within basal ganglia currently explains these 2 opposing sets of neurological symptoms.
