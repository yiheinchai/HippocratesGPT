# [047] Pain

# Definitions of Pain and Nociception

- It is Protective: Pain prevents from using region, so it can heal, preventing damage from occurring.
- Pain has some value in limiting the extent of injury but increased pain sensitivity following injury prevents further damaged to the injured tissue as they heal

### Definition

- An unpleasant emotional and sensory experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage.
- Due to the ability of pain to arise from potentially tissue damaging stimuli, this means that pain can often arise idiopathically with no identifiable cause

### Nociception

- Nociception is different to pain as the relationship between pain and injury is variable
- Nociception is the neural process of encoding and processing noxious stimuli by the Somatosensory Cortex
- A Nociceptor is a peripherally localised neuron preferentially sensitive to a noxious stimulus
- Nociceptive behaviours/signs produced during Nociception include withdrawal and other conditioned motor responses (Aggressiveness and avoidance/escape) and immobility (allows for the maintenance of a painless posture)
- Nociception and the experience of pain are evoked only at pressure and temperatures high enough to potentially injury tissues and by toxic or inflammatory mediators
- Pain is highly individual and subjective and the translation of nociception into pain perception can be altered by stress (prioritises other functions like locomotion/escape) or exacerbated by anticipation
- Pathways that signal injury or potential injury to the brain can be described but their activation may not always result in the experience of pain - This means that they cannot be called ‘pain pathways’
- In some cases, the relationship between injury and pain experience is predictable and constant

# Pain

- It is not a simple sensory pathway and is considered pain to be far more complex.
- This is primarily because the relationship of pain to injury is very variable so pain performs poorly as just a sensation
- Pain performs poorly as a sensation:
1. Poorly localised (e.g. referred pain)
2. Immediate injury can be painless (e.g. a cut) but pain can be delayed in onset
3. Injury also immediately causes an emotional response (e.g. anger, anxiety)
4. Relationship of pain intensity to extent of injury can be poor and variable
- E.g 70% of seriously wounded soldiers did not require analgesics whereas 70% of civilians with post-op pain did require analgesics.
- This means that the context in which pain occurs is important in the degree of pain experienced

---

# Injury and Pain

- There is a strong relationship between injury and pain but pain experience can be modulated (E.g Increased in an anticipatory setting where pain is expected and decreased in severe trauma/injury in stressful settings)

---

# Nociceptors

- Fast Pain is conveyed by Relatively Large Myelinated Aδ Fibres whereas Slow Pain is conveyed by Small Unmyelinated C Fibres (As Aδ Fibres have a much higher conduction velocity than C Fibres)
- This produces 2 pain waves/phases - Initial, Short duration pain and delayed, prolonged pain
- The Majority of Pain/Nociceptive Fibres are C Fibres

# Pain Amplifiers and Pathways

- Injury establishes two pain amplifiers within the Nociceptive Pathway:
1. Amplifier 1 - Peripheral Sensitisation (Nociceptive Nerve Endings in the Skin) 
2. Amplifier 2 - Central Sensitisation (Dorsal Horn)
- These are temporary sensitisations that resolve after healing has occurred
- Central Sensitisation increases the apparent area of sensitivity on the skin where pain can be experienced

### Peripheral Sensitisation

- In the skin and deep tissue nociceptors sensitise following injury due to changes in nociceptors and surrounding tissues
- Substances like Bradykinin, Prostaglandins, Histamine etc from the Blood and Mast Cells within tissues act upon Nociceptive Nerve Endings (mainly C fibres) found around the Injury Site
- Notably, NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) is released by Mast Cells in the Tissue and act on TrkA and TRPV1 (Capsaicin) Receptor to increase the sensitivity of the Nociceptors

- Peripheral Sensitisation is followed by Central Sensitisation of Dorsal Horn Networks. There is:
1. Presynaptic Facilitation of Nociceptors via Alterations of the Nerve Terminal
2. Increased Excitability of Neural Networks within the Dorsal Horn
3. Microglial and Astrocytes are activated
4. Descending Controls from the Hindbrain regulate pain-related signals entering through the Dorsal Horn (This is the main factor responsible for the degree of Nociceptive Input into the Dorsal Horn)

# Descending Pathways Modulating Pain

- Injury Related Information via Nociceptors projects predominantly to the Parabrachial Area in the Brainstem (Pons-Midbrain Junction) and to some extent, the Thalamus
- The Parabrachial Area then projects to areas of the brain to direct escape, attack or freeze to generate behavioural changes needed for adequate healing (E.g Quiescence and Sleeping and Remembering)
- Many Brain Areas are activated in response to 'Painful' Stimuli such as the Anterior Cingulate Cortex, Somatosensory Cortex, Thalamus and the Insular Cortex

![Screenshot 2021-12-05 at 13.37.15.png](%5B047%5D%20Pain%20477e8d888a0f479286579bcd7c82c049/Screenshot_2021-12-05_at_13.37.15.png)

- Congenital Insensitivity to Pain can be caused by loss of expression of TrkA Receptors or Na⁺ Channels
- Patients who are insensitive to pain have similar pattern of brain activity, meaning there is no specific pain cortical area and hence, pain is not a simple sensory system
- Therefore, the Lack of a Pain Specific Cortex, pain is an intrinsically dynamic process that emerges from synchronised activity within Neuronal Networks or the coordinated activity of multiple brain areas
- Therefore, instead of being deemed as a simple sensory system, it is theorised that pain signals the existence of a body state where healing should be initiated and is only experience until healing is resolved, therefore signalling body states and the impending onset of a form of behaviour (E.g Thirst and Hunger)

# Chronic Pain

- Pain is experienced for > 3 months
- It is difficult to manage and contribute significant to disability
- It can be classed as Primary and Secondary Chronic Pain (There is poor modelling and evidence regarding the nature of Primary Chronic pain)
- In Chronic Primary Pain, Pain is idiopathic and can be conceived as a disease with few treatment options (Fibromyalgia, Complex Region Pain Syndrome etc.)
- As they cannot be modelled experimentally, they are poorly understood
- In Chronic Secondary Pain Syndomes, pain initially manifests itself as a Sx of another disease which can be treated
- Chronic Pain often manifests alongside multiple comorbidities (E.g Fatigue, Mental Health Issues) and commonly arises after surgery

---

# Analgesia and Chronic Pain

- Different types of pain require different types of Analgesia
- For Primary Chronic Pain, as underlying mechanisms are unknown, there are no recommended treatments, but more holistic approaches (E.g Accupuncture) may be beneficial in some individuals
- Different Types of Chronic Pain can be modelled, classified on whether they arise in the PNS and CNS

PNS:

1. Inflammatory Pain due to tissue damage

CNS:

1. Neuropathic Pain - Initiated/caused by Primary Lesion or Disease in the PNS/CNS or Thalamic Stroke
- Where pathology causes Peripheral and Central Damage, this can lead to both Neuropathic and Inflammatory Pain manifesting together (E.g Cancer)
- These can be modulated and controlled by drugs to some extent (Predominantly Inflammatory as Neuropathic pain is difficult to manage with drugs)
- Inflammatory pain is mainly controlled by Anti-Inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs (Paracetamol and Ibuprofen)
- Neuropathic Pain can be severe and can be modulated by Gabapentin, Tricyclic Antidepressants and Opiates
- Tricyclics are usually the first line Rx for Neuropathic Pain as they are cheap and have been shown to be extremely effective in some situations
- Opiates can also be given for long term pain but Px are at risk of Addiction

---

# New Analgesics

- Approaches to the control of Chronic Pain can be targeted at the:
1. Periphery - Blocking Peripheral Sensitisation of Nociceptors
2. CNS - Blocking Central Sensitisation
3. CNS and PNS - Reorganising Cortical Networks and the Pharmacodynamics of compounds like BTx to produce analgesics without side effects of tolerance and addiction (as is seen in Opiates)
- Blocking NGF-TrkA signalling produces profound analgesia notably in Osteoarthritis and Bone Cancer Px
- In Amputees, the use of mirrors so that it appears that the amputated limb is still present (this is a reflection of the contralateral non-amputated body part) causes Phantom Limb pain to disappear
- Therefore, the conscious thought of the Amputated Limb being present indicates that Phantom Limb Pain arises in the Somatosensory Cortex
- Psychedelics act on the 5-HT2AR predominantly and Psilocybin blocks this to produce analgesia in pain arising in the Somatosensory Cortex predominantly (E.g Phantom Limb Pain - Often combined with Mirror Visual Feedback Analgesia)

---

# Peripheral Sensitisation

- NGF (Released from Mast Cells in the Tissue at the Site of Injury) stimulates TrkA, which phosphorylates TRPV1 (Capsaicin) Receptor to increase its sensitivity/activity to sensitise peripheral nerves
- Tenazumab = mAb against NGF and does not cross the Blood Brain Barrier

# Opiates

- These are deemed to be the gold standard for acute pain relief and Chronic Pain
- However, their effectiveness in the Mx of Chronic Pain meant that they were overprescribed (mainly in the US), leading to an increase in Overdoses and Opiate Misuse
- Problems = Tolerance, Noxious Hypersensitivity (Pain Receptors in the Brain become more sensitive to overcome Opiate Inhibition/Antagonism here) and Addiction
- There is little evidence to suggest that Opiates like Oxycodone (Slow Release Opiates) are useful in the Rx of Neuropathic Pain, with adverse effects being common
- Therefore, Opiates shouldn't be prescribed for Chronic Pain

---

# Spinal Cord Manipulation

- There have been new approaches developed in Pain Management involving the control of Secondary Chronic Pain by manipulating Pain Signalling Circuitry in the Spinal Cord
- In Chronic Pain, injury-related information is relayed to the brain via Ascending Pathway and persists after the Injury has healed
- This is often due to long term plastic changes in the Spinal Cord that do not reverse
- Therefore, by inhibiting the flow of Injury-Related Information to the Brain, Analgesia can be produced
- Superficial Projection Neurons from the Dorsal Horn, involved in Ascending Pain Pathways, express NK1 (Substance P Receptor) - GPCR
- When Substance P binds to and stimulates NK1, it causes the Receptor Complex to become internalised into the Neuron
- By attaching Ricin-Like Toxin Saporin to Substance P, the Toxin will be internalised into the Neuron alongside the Substance P:NK1 Complex, leading to Neuronal Death
- This therefore allows for Selective Ablation of the Ascending Pain Pathways
- Whilst this has no effect on Acute Pain Processing, later developing Chronic Pain Sensitivity is reduced or lost (Notably used experimentally in Bone Cancers of Hindlimb in Dogs) - This is not used in Humans as it kills CNS Neurons in Lamina I which cannot regenerate
- In Humans, Botox Derivates can be conjugated to Substance P/Opiate like Dermorphin to silence Central Nociceptive Neurons in the Dorsal Horn over months (long period of time) and produces good pain control without killing neurons by reducing mechanical sensitivity that develops after nerve injury
