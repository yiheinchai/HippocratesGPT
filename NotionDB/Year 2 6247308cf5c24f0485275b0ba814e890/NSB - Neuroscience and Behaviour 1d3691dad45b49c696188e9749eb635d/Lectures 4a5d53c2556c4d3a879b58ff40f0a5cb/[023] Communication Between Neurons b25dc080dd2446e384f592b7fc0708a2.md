# [023] Communication Between Neurons

# Cardiac Action Potential

- Phase 4 – This is the resting membrane potential, mainly established by K⁺ channels
- Phase 0 – Rapid depolarisation due to opening of Voltage-Gated Na+ channels allowing Na+ influx.
- Phase 1 – There is partial repolarisation due to inactivation of Na⁺ channels and opening of voltage-gated K⁺ channels at peak depolarisation, allowing K⁺ efflux, which alongside reduced Na⁺ influx, repolarises the membrane slightly.
- Phase 2 (**different from what happens in neurons***)* This is the plateau phase due to opening of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (L-type) allowing Ca²⁺ influx (K⁺ channels remain open).
- Ca²⁺ influx is balanced against K⁺ efflux so that Vm remains relatively constant
- Ca²⁺ channels act like very slow
Na⁺ channels, mediating Ca²⁺ Influx which acts to increase Vm (opposed by K⁺ efflux to keep Vm constant)
- Phase 3 – Repolarisation occurs due to inactivation of Ca²⁺ channels and continued K⁺ efflux, meaning Cation efflux dominates, hyperpolarising the membrane.
- The atrial action potential is identical except that the plateau phase is
shorter.

# SA Node and Unstable Action Potential

- Like Na⁺, Extracellular [Ca²⁺] > Intracellular [Ca²⁺] and as most cells are polarised, when there is a sudden increase in permeability/conductance to this ion (Via opening of Channels), this can depolarise the cell and trigger an action potential - This is true for any Cation
- Phase 4 – Slow depolarisation (no resting potential) due to opening of HCN channels (If) allowing Na⁺ influx.
- HCN Channels open spontaneously due to Hyperpolarisation, thus setting the Heart Rate. The rate at which the channels open and hence, If, can be modified by the ANS
- HCN = Hyperpolarisation-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channels
- Voltage-gated Ca channels (T-type) open towards the end of this phase allowing Ca²⁺ influx.
- Phase 0 – Depolarisation occurs due to opening of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (L-type) allowing rapid Ca²⁺
influx, which causes Rapid Depolarisation.
- (Here Na⁺ channels are entirely
replaced by two types of Ca²⁺ channels so Ca²⁺ mediates depolarisation, not Na⁺)
- Phase 3 – Repolarisation occurs due to inactivation of Ca²⁺ channels and the opening of voltage-gated K⁺ channels allowing K⁺ efflux to dominate, which hyperpolarises the membrane.
- The AP recorded in the AVN is exactly the same

# Action Potential Time Scale

- Cells that rely upon Ca²⁺ channels have much slower action potentials than those that rely on Na⁺ channels as Ca²⁺ Channels open more slowly and hence, produce slower Ca²⁺ influx than Na⁺ Channels – Neurons are fast (with rapid APs) because of their Na⁺ channels and their role in depolarisation vs Ca²⁺ channels.
- This means that whilst the Neuronal AP is completed in 1-2 msec whilst the Atrial Pacemaker Potential is longer than this (due to Ca²⁺ driving depolarisation, not Na⁺) and the Ventricular Myocyte Potential being even longer than this due to the Plateau Phase involving Ca²⁺ Influx and K⁺ efflux
- Action potentials are extremely variable in morphology and ionic currents across cells

# Propagation of Depolarisation and Myelination

- In a long skinny axon, once a local depolarisation starts via the opening of Local Voltage-Gated Na⁺ Channels, this depolarisation difuses along the axon to more distal axon segments to partially and passively depolarise the membrane here
- Whilst some Na⁺ leaks out of the Axon as it diffuses distally, enough remains within the Axon to open neighbouring resting Na⁺ channels, causing passive depolarisation here past the Threshold for Na⁺ Channel activation, allowing for the generation of an AP in this neighbouring downstream segment
- This cycle continues downstream until the AP reaches the Axon Terminal
- This propagation is unidirectional as more proximal/upstream Voltage Gated Na⁺ Channels (that have previously opened) have been inactivated due to the peak depolarisation seen in the Proximal Axon whilst K⁺ Channels mediating K⁺ efflux have opened
- This means that Upstream Inactive Voltage Gated Na⁺ Channels cannot be opened via Depolarisation of the Upstream Axon whilst this Upstream Axon is also hyperpolarised (and hence, inexcitable) due to K⁺ efflux, preventing the generation and propagation of an AP upstream
- The propagation of an AP being due to successive AP generations via the sequence of opening Na⁺ Channels in neighbouring regions of the Axon moving downstream means that the AP does not lose magnitude as it propagates down the Axon as a new AP is generated each step along the Axon (Hence, the AP is all or nothing - full magnitude or does not occur at all)

![Screenshot 2021-11-22 at 12.04.53.png](%5B023%5D%20Communication%20Between%20Neurons%20b25dc080dd2446e384f592b7fc0708a2/Screenshot_2021-11-22_at_12.04.53.png)

- If an Action Potential is initiated in the middle of the Axon, the lack of Upstream Inactivated Na⁺ Channels means that Na⁺ will diffuse both up and downstream to open Na⁺ channels and generate APs here, causing the AP to propagate up and down the Axon
- The rate of depolarisation depends on several things:
1. Diameter of the Axon (Larger = Fasted Conduction Velocity) as there is more rapid passive Na⁺ diffusion down the axon, allowing APs to be generated more rapidly in neighbouring/downstream segments of the Axon - This is used predominantly in Invertebrates
2. Degree of Myelination - This is used predominantly in vertebrates

- Myelin is found surrounding Axonal Segments as a Myelin Sheath, with Unmyelinated Regions of Axon between these Myelin Sheaths forming Nodes of Ranvier
- Underneath Myelinated Segments of Axons, there are very few Na⁺ and K⁺ Channels found
- All of the Na⁺ and K⁺ Channels of an Axon are found at Nodes of Ravier
- When an AP is generated and there is Passive Na⁺ Diffusion down the Axon, there can be no Na⁺ leakage out of the Axon as these regions of axon are insulated by Myelin which is impermeable to Na⁺
- This lack of Na⁺ leakage increases the Na⁺ diffusion speed down the axon as this lack of leakage maintains Axonal [Na⁺] and hence, maintains a steep concentration gradient which drives Na⁺ movement down the axon to the next Node of Ranvier to generate an AP here.
- When there is Saltatory Conduction, APs are generated at Nodes of Ranvier vs along the entire length of the Axon
- Myelination allows the depolarisation to jump from one node of Ranvier to another without waiting for Na⁺ channels along the length of the axon to open (Saltatory Conduction), which increases the conduction velocity

![Screenshot 2021-11-22 at 12.09.25.png](%5B023%5D%20Communication%20Between%20Neurons%20b25dc080dd2446e384f592b7fc0708a2/Screenshot_2021-11-22_at_12.09.25.png)

- Myelinated axons are faster and more efficient.
- As Opening of Na⁺ Channels takes time (more than it does for Na⁺ to diffuse down the Axon), the opening of Na⁺ Channels is the rate limiting factor for Maximum Conduction Speed
- As APs are only generated at Nodes of Ranvier during Saltatory Conduction, Fewer Na⁺ channels open in order to propagate the AP, meaning less Na⁺ enters the axon
- This means that less Na⁺ needs to be pumped back out of the axon via the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase in order to restore Resting Potential from the Hyperpolarised State and hence, maintain the propagation of the AP
- Furthermore, where there is reduced Na⁺ Channel expression along the Myelinated Axon due to the impermeability of the Myelin Sheath, there is no need to open Na⁺ Channels under these Myelin Sheaths, further increasing conduction velocity
- Diseases reducing myelination are serious problems in peripheral neurons, notably in muscle control and movement

# Synaptic Transmission

- Once the action potential reaches the end of an axon, the depolarisation is translated to a chemical signal at the synapse
- The synapse onto muscles, the neuromuscular junction is a very large, robust synapse
- Much of what is known about synaptic behaviour comes from studies of the Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)

# Neuromuscular Junction and Synaptic Transmission

- Synaptic Vessels dock onto the Presynaptic Membrane at the Active Zone, opposite the Junctional Folds of the Postsynaptic Sarcolemma

- Once an AP reaches the Presynaptic Nerve Terminal, Voltage-Gated Ca²⁺ channels open here.
- Here, Ca²⁺ binds Synaptotagmin on the Vesicle to form the SNARE Complex alongside Synaptobrevin (Vesicle) and SNAP-25 + Syntaxin on the Presynaptic Membrane, which pulls the Vesicle towards the Presynaptic Membrane
- The Vesicle then binds to the Presynaptic Membrane and opens a pore which allows for the neurotransmitter to be released from the Vesicle into the Synaptic Cleft

![Screenshot 2021-11-22 at 12.21.49.png](%5B023%5D%20Communication%20Between%20Neurons%20b25dc080dd2446e384f592b7fc0708a2/Screenshot_2021-11-22_at_12.21.49.png)

- Most Vesicles are recycled
- Once Postsynaptic Receptors have been stimulated, Neurotransmitter in the Synaptic Cleft is endocytosed from the Cell Membrane to reform Vesicles (from an Endosome formed by the fusion of Endosynaptic Vesicles), which are refilled with Neurotransmitters
- This is an active process

- When the movement of K⁺ ions through K⁺ Channels is blocked, there is reduced capacity for neurons to repolarise following Depolarisation in the AP Cycle
- This means that the resting potential of the Neuron to be more positive and hence, making the Neuron Hyperexcitable
- When K⁺ Leak Channels are blocked, there is no passive K⁺ Efflux during Phase 1 (Resting Potential), meaning that the unblocked Na⁺ Leak into the Neuron causes the Neuron to slowly depolarising, eventually reaching the Threshold Vm, resulting in AP generation

- As well as myelin, the presynaptic terminal is associated with many diseases
- As well as diseases, the presynaptic terminal is the target of cosmetic Botox treatments, which prevents Vesicle Docking and Fusion
- This prevents the contraction of the Muscles of Facial Expression, causing skin to remain smooth and not wrinkled
- Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS) results in the Autoimmune destruction of Presynaptic Ca²⁺ Channels, preventing Vesicular Docking and Fusion due to no Ca²⁺ Entry into the Presynaptic Nerve Terminal
