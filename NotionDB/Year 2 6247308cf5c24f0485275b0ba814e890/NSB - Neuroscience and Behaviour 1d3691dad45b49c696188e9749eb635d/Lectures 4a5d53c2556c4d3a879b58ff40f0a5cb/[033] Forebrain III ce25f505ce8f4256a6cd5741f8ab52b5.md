# Thalamus

- The thalamus is found on the top of the brainstem, on each side of the third ventricle (it extends slightly more posterior than the Lateral Ventricles but forms the lateral walls of the Lateral Ventricle)
- The hypothalamus is below the thalamus on each side
- There is a groove between the Interventricular Foramen and the Opening of the Cerebral Aqueduct, called the Hypothalamic Sulcus which divides the Thalamus Superiorly and the Hypothalamus Inferiorly
- Often, but not always there is an interthalamic adhesion which joins the two medial surfaces of the thalamus
- The thalamus is part of the diencephalon and is related to the third ventricle
- All pathways carrying specific information to the cerebral cortex synapse in the thalamus. This excludes olfaction
- The reason for this common synapse is that all the inputs carry different sorts of information, and this needs to be put into a form of information that the cerebral cortex can understand
- The great somatosensory pathways all pass through and synapse the thalamus
- The somatosensory part of the thalamus will have reciprocal connections with the somatosensory cortex
- The basal ganglia will project to motor parts of the thalamus which has reciprocal connections with the supplementary motor area
- Motor information from the cerebellum will synapse in the thalamus and connect with the premotor area and motor cortex so that motor activities can be influenced
- The thalamus relays information to and from the cerebral cortex

**Reciprocal connections:**

- Information going to the Cerebral Cortex has information that is relayed through a synapse, in a particular nucleus in the thalamus.
- Different information goes to different nuclei in the thalamus but each nucleus in the thalamus has reciprocal connections with an area of cerebral cortex
- Motor nuclei will have reciprocal connections with motor areas of the cerebral cortex
- Reciprocal connections mean that information from the given area of the cerebral cortex will also go to the thalamus (E.g Thalamus ↔  Cerebral Cortex)
- Not all connections between the Thalamus and the Cortex are reciprocal as there are some regions of the Cerebral Cortex that only have an output to the Thalamus and not an input as well
- Information can also be passed between areas of the cortex via the thalamus (E.g Cortex → Thalamus → Cortex)
- However, the main form of communication between areas of the cerebral cortex is through direct association even though some of it occurs through the thalamus

# Nuclei of the Thalamus

- The image below shows a plan view looking down on the thalamus
- The dotted line shows a midline, on the other side of which there would be another thalamus
- The top of the diagram of the thalamus on the left is the front, whilst the bottom is the back
- There is a sheet of white matter called the internal medullary lamina within the thalamus which bifurcates anteriorly and separates off the anterior nucleus of the thalamus
- The internal medullary lamina is Y-shaped when viewed from above
- The anterior nucleus is bounded by the birfucations of the Internal Medullary Lamina and receives axons from the mamillary bodies and is involved in memory
- The dorsal medial nucleus is situated dorsal and medially
- It is involved in higher functions such as personality, social behaviour and planning for the future
- The most posterior part is called the pulvinar, and is particularly large in primates
- It is like a “big shelf” which sticks out the back of the thalamus (It is found on the Posterior and most of the Lateral Surface of the Thalamus)
- It is involved in the visual pathway, particularly with moving objects.
- It has lots of communications with parts of the Parietal and Occipital Lobes
- In the middle of the thalamus, embedded within the Internal Medullary Lamina, on each side are the intralaminar nuclei.
- The Intralaminar Nuclei are bordered medially by the Dorsal Medial Nucleus and the Pulvinar Laterally

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.39.44.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.39.44.png)

- On the lateral side of the thalamus there is a row of three nuclei which have very specific functions
- They are all ventrally placed on the lateral side of the thalamus
- The most posterior one is called the ventral posterior nucleus, the middle one the ventral lateral nucleus and the most anterior one the ventral anterior nucleus
- The ventral posterior nucleus can be seen below the intralaminar nuclei of each side on a cross section
    
    ![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.40.33.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.40.33.png)
    
- There are two bumps on the pulvinar on the posteroinferior surface of the Thalamus called the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei
- The Medial Geniculate Nuclei is found medially and is involved in the auditory pathway and the Lateral Geniculate Nuclei is found laterally and is involved in the visual pathway
- The thalamic reticular nucleus forms a capsule laterally around the ventral thalamus and receives collaterals from all the fibres passing through the thalamus

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.41.09.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.41.09.png)

# Connections and Functions of the Thalamic Nuclei - Somatosensory Pathways

- Each thalamic nucleus has reciprocal connections with an area of the cerebral cortex
- The main pathways are:
1. The medial lemniscus system conveying discriminative touch, vibration sense and conscious proprioception
2. The spinothalamic tract conveying nondiscriminative/light touch, temperature and pain
- These get relayed through a synapse to the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus, which is the main somatosensory nucleus of the thalamus
- It receives information from these tracts contralaterally
- It then sends this information to the primary somatosensory cortex
- It has reciprocal connections with the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) within the Postcentral Gyrus of the Parietal Lobe

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.42.21.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.42.21.png)

- The ventral posterior nucleus has a somatotopic arrangement, where each part receives information from a specific area of the body
- There are two parts:
1. Ventral posteromedial: This receives information concerning the head and some of the neck
2. Ventral posterolateral: This receives information concerning the rest of the body 
- This means there is a somatotopic map throughout the somatosensory system
- Taste fibres (tongue) are received at the most medial aspect of the ventral posteromedial part
    
    ![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.44.19.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.44.19.png)
    

**Damage to the somatosensory nuclei:**

- This damage is usually caused by strokes to the posterior cerebral artery and can affect the ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus
- This can cause thalamic syndrome
- This manifests as any sensation from the contralateral side of the body as being interpreted as painful
- It can be extremely severe and results in constant pain
- This can result in suicide
- Historically, individuals with this condition who had a pre-frontal lobotomy resulted in patients
not being bothered by the pain, despite the fact they could still feel it (often due to a lack of concern for the future/longevity of the pain)

---

# Connections and Functions of the Thalamic Nuclei - Motor Pathways (Cerebellum and Basal Ganglia)

- Two main places send information to the thalamus and hence to the primary motor and premotor cortex
- These are:
1. The dentate nucleus (main output of cerebellum)
2. Internal segment of globus pallidus (main output of basal ganglia)
- They end in complex patterns in the ventral lateral and ventral anterior nuclei
- More of the cerebellar fibres go to the ventral lateral nucleus
- More of the basal ganglia fibres go to the ventral anterior nucleus
- The fibres project from the thalamus to the motor cortex
- The ventral lateral nucleus (mainly cerebellar) fibres project to the primary motor cortex
- The ventral anterior nucleus (mainly basal ganglia) fibres project to the supplementary motor area and premotor cortex
    
    ![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.45.56.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.45.56.png)
    
- First technique used to try and treat Parkinson's was to ablate part of the Ventral Lateral Nucleus of the Thalamus that corresponds to the production of a Tremor in Parkinson's

---

# Connections and Functions of the Thalamic Nuclei - Visual Pathway

- The visual pathway starts from the retinal ganglion cells which send axons back towards the brain
- Their axons project down the optic nerve and tract, ending in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus
- The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has reciprocal connections with the primary visual cortex (V1/Area 17/calcarine cortex)
- The V1 is buried on the medial surface of the occipital lobe
- Each area of V1 receives information from the contralateral visual field of both eyes
- There is a two-way flow of information, more axons go from V1 to the LGN than vice-versa

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.52.46.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.52.46.png)

# Connections and Functions of the Thalamic Nuclei - Auditory Pathway

- The cochlear nerves coming from the cochlea end in cochlear nuclei
- The inferior colliculus has an obligatory synapse with these nerves
- From here, the fibres travel to the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) of the thalamus
- The MGN has reciprocal connections with the primary auditory cortex
- The primary auditory cortex is buried on the transverse gyrus on the top of the superior temporal gyrus, buried in the lateral fissure

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.53.49.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.53.49.png)

# Dorsal Medial Nucleus and Intralaminar Nuclei

### Dorsal Medial Nucleus

- The dorsal medial nucleus receives information from many places
- One of the places it receives information from is the amygdala
- The amygdala is found in the temporal lobe, near the tip of the tail of the caudate nucleus
- It is close to the uncus and olfactory cortex
- It is an important place for emotional responses and sends axons to the dorsal medial nucleus
- The dorsal medial nucleus has reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex through the anterior limb of the Internal Capsule, which is important for emotional responses as well as behaviour

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.55.37.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_14.55.37.png)

### Intralaminar Nuclei

- The intralaminar nuclei are within the white matter of the internal medullary lamina
- They receive lots of information from the brainstem reticular formation
- The brainstem reticular formation receives a lot of somatosensory information, particularly sensations like nociception
- The intralaminar nuclei send axons to widespread areas of cerebral cortex and the striatum, resulting in widespread activation of the cerebral cortex upon stimulation of these nuclei, which increases alertness
- The function appears to be causing heighted alertness/awareness due to nociception
- The projections to the basal ganglia is alerting the motor system, particularly the area that selects the appropriate pattern of motor activity to deal with the nociceptive stimulus
- Noradrenergic fibres from the locus coeruleus in the pons help to activate cerebral cortex
- Reticular fibres also activate the nucleus basalis, which sends cholinergic fibres all over the neocortex
- Hypothalamic nuclei are also involved in consciousness
- If you damage the reticular formation in the medial part of the rostral pons or midbrain, or damage the intralaminar nuclei bilaterally (AKA Connections between Reticular Formation and Intralaminar Nuclei are damaged), a profound coma is produced due to reduced stimulation and activity of the cerebral cortex.

### Deep Brain Stimulation in Comatose Patients

- Electrode stimulation of the intralaminar nuclei due to patients who have problems with consciousness has been attempted
- This is controversial as It occasionally works but often does not

# The Limbic System and Hippocampus

- The limbic cortex consists of the cingulate gyrus superiorly which is continuous with the parahippocampal gyrus (inferior to the midbrain)
- The parahippocampal gyrus is found on the medial surface of the temporal lobe and has a “hook-like” aspect which projects medially called the uncus, which is olfactory cortex but the parahippocampal gyrus has other functions
- Lateral to the parahippocampal gyrus is the collateral sulcus, which has an aspect of cortex buried there
    
    ![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.00.15.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.00.15.png)
    

**Cingulum**

- There is a large bundle of axons which comes from the cingulate gyrus, curls around the splenium of the corpus callosum and ends in the entorhinal cortex
- This is the cingulum which connects with the entorhinal cortex
- Axons from the cingulate gyrus pass to the parahippocampal gyrus and entorhinal cortex, which subsequently sends axons to the hippocampus

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.02.03.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.02.03.png)

- The inferomedial part of the temporal lobe (containing the hippocampus and adjacent cortex) is required for episodic memory formation
- Episodic memory is the kind of memory which enables one to remember the events of the previous day
- It enables one to remember new events which occur
- Bacterial meningitis (pus tends to accumulate near the skull base) and viral encephalitis can affect this region and can destroy the Inferomedial Temporal Lobe
- Destruction of the Inferomedial Temporal Lobe leads to anterograde amnesia, where new memories cannot be formed.
- The hippocampus itself, which is part of the medial temporal lobe, dies rapidly as a result of anoxia and is thus very vulnerable to strokes
- The Entorhinal Cortex acts as the main gateway into the Hippocampus and is comprised of Allocortex (not Neocortex)
- The Entorhinal Cortex bulges into the Temporal Horn of the Lateral Ventricle, located just above the Parahippocampal Gyrus
- Whilst New Memories are likely to be generated in the Hippocampus in the Medial Temporal Lobe, memories are believed to be stored in widespread areas of the Neocortex

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.03.09.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.03.09.png)

- The image below is a diagram of the medial temporal lobe and shows the hippocampal formation
- The entorhinal cortex is a transitional area with a region called the hippocampus
- The hippocampus itself is found in the Middle Cranial Fossa, embedded in the temporal lobe and any part of this gyrus with CA in its name
- The Hippocampus is formed by the entorhinal cortex bending laterally
- CA1 runs to CA2 which runs to CA3
- Some neuroanatomists define a CA4 area as well
- At the end of the hippocampus after CA3 is the dentate gyrus which is a much smaller gyrus. This is disconnected from the hippocampus and folded around the end of the hippocampus.
- Dentate Gyrus + Hippocampus + Entorhinal Cortex = Hippocampal Formation
- The Fornix is a strip of white matter that originates from the Hippocampal Formation. It runs superior to the Hippocampus to separate the Hippocampus Inferiorly from the Lateral Ventricle Superiorly
- The hippocampus is very important in memory

# Cells and Structure of the Hippocampus

### Cells of the Hippocampus

- Dr John O’Keefe found that there were pyramidal neurons of the Hippocampus called place cells which were only active when a rat was in a particular place (specific place cells become active in different places)
- There are different places for different locations
- These formed a “map of the world as the rat knows it” within the Hippocampus
- This is presumably also the case for humans
- They are thus involved in spatial memory
- The hippocampus is larger in taxi drivers in London, who require good spatial memory
- They also appeared to find that the hippocampus enlarged whilst the taxi drivers were learning
- This could be possible as the dentate gyrus is one of the few places where new neurons are produced throughout life in mammals and probably people

There are grid cells found in the entorhinal cortex:

- These are active when the animal is in a particular position within a specific place, as if they were arranged upon a grid
- The grid cells are not important for telling the animal where it is, but that it is moving in a particular direction and how fast it is moving

### Components of the Hippocampus

- The diagram below represents the hippocampus buried in the temporal lobe
- The hippocampus cannot be seen on the outside, it is a gyrus, but it is buried in the temporal lobe
- A bundle called the fornix connects the hippocampus to the mammary bodies of the hypothalamus by running from the Superior Surface of the Hippocampus and ascends and curves to run over the Thalamus.
- The fornix comes from the hippocampus, arches over the thalamus and goes down to the mammary bodies of the hypothalamus
- From the mammillary bodies, there are neurons which project up to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus
- The fornix contains axons going in both directions
1. There are pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal formation that project axons through the fornix and end in the mammary bodies
2. There are neurons from the septal nuclei which project cholinergic neurones in the opposite direction down the fornix and end up in Hippocampus.
- ACh in any part of the cerebral cortex is important in improving efficiency and functioning by increasing synaptic information - they do not carry specific information
- This pathway is called the septohippocampal cholinergic pathway which is important for maintaining good function in the hippocampus, allowing for efficient cognition and memory
- The septal nuclei are on the medial surface of the hemisphere and found on the base of the Septum Pellucidum

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.22.46.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.22.46.png)

- There are two main sources of input/afferents to the hippocampus:
1. Neurons from the entorhinal cortex send axons superiorly through the cortex to the dentate gyrus directly
- From the dentate gyrus, there are axons of granule cells which give rise to mossy fibres that go to CA3 of the hippocampus
- These axons are part of the **perforant pathway** as they perforate the cerebral cortex (hippocampus)
- The Perforant Pathway is the main source of information entering the Hippocampus
- This conveys specific information which will be added to memory stores
1. Septohippocampal cholinergic fibres from the septal nuclei
- These go via the cortex, running in the fornix to project all over the Hippocampus
- There is also an alvear path from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus
- The efferents from the hippocampus pass through the fornix and to the entorhinal cortex
- These fibres are important for promoting synaptic activity and communiciation within the Hippocampus

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.23.48.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.23.48.png)

There are 2 main paths of output from the Hippocampus:

1. Fibres from the Hippocampus enter the Fornix and project down the fornix to the Mamillary Body, which then run up to the Anterior Nucleus of the Thalamus
2. Fibres from CA1 also project back into the Entorhinal Cortex

# Mammillary Bodies and Fornix

**Mammillary Bodies**

- These are bumps on the bottom of the hypothalamus, found Superior to the Brainstem
- These project axons up to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus
- Axons go from the fornix and end in the mammary body
- From the mammary body, there is a projection up to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus
- There are reciprocal connections of the cingulate cortex with the anterior nucleus of the thalamus
    
    **Fornix**
    
    - It is found lateral to the Corpus Callosum with a similar appearance, but projects more steeply inferiorly than the Corpus Callosum

# Circuit of Papez

- This circuit is called the Circuit of Papez which is involved in memory formation
- There is no evidence that information actually goes around this circuit
- However, these parts are connected
- Bilateral damage to any part of this circuit can cause profound effects on episodic memory
1. Mammary bodies project up to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus
2. The anterior nucleus of the thalamus has reciprocal connections with the cingulate gyrus
3. The cingulate gyrus sends axons to Entorhinal cortex via the Cingulum which is connected to lots of other areas of Neocortex (six-layered)
4. The entorhinal cortex sends axons to the Hippocampus via the Perforant and Alvear Paths
5. The Hippocampus sends axons through the fornix to the mammary bodies
- Schaffer collaterals are axonal collaterals given off by CA3 pyramidal cells to CA1
- They are important in memory formation and the emotional network of the Papez circuit

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.28.25.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.28.25.png)

# Pathologies related to the Circuit of Papez

### Patient NA

- The Circuit of Papez got damaged in the case of an American soldier (Patient NA) who had a fencing foil go up through a nostril into the middle of his brain:
- It thus damaged the fornix and anterior part of the thalamus bilaterally
- He never formed a new memory
- There were no other obvious issues

### Patient HM

- In order to try and control temporal lobe epilepsy, he had bilateral removal of his medial temporal lobes
- This stopped his epilepsy, but he was unable to form any new-long term memories
- Infections can achieve this effect via bilateral damage to the temporal lobe

### Kluver-Bucy Syndrome

- This results from loss of the anterior part of the temporal lobe in monkeys and sometimes humans

**Symptoms and Sign:**

1. Profound antrograde amnesia: Aspect of the temporal lobe required to make new memories are
destroyed
2. Hypersexuality
3. Placidity due to removal of the amygdala
4. Ability to taste everything
5. Visual agnosia (inability to recognise things) due to loss of the visual association cortex
- The “what” stream goes to the temporal lobe
- This means one is unable to recognise classes of objects

### Korsakoff's Syndrome

- This occurs in alcoholics who have a thiamine/Vitamin B1 deficiency
- This causes degeneration of the mammary bodies and the anterior part of the thalamus
- There is thus profound destruction of parts of the circuit of Papez bilaterally
- This results in profound antrograde amnesia and confabulation (the production of fabricated memories)
- This can be partly prevented by giving thiamine supplements to alcoholics
- If they keep drinking, the majority of the brain will be affected, but by giving thiamine supplements memory will not be lost early on in the condition
- Once these parts have been affected, giving thiamine will not have any positive effect

# Essential Functions of the Hypothalamus

### 1) Memory

- This is through the mammillary bodies (bumps on the bottom of the hypothalamus) as well as limbic connections

### 2) Hormones

- They are involved in neurosecretion from the posterior pituitary by producing those hormones
- They also produce releasing factors that regulate hormone release from the anterior pituitary

### 3) Regulation of the ANS

- Limbic areas of the cerebral cortex send axons to the hypothalamus
- The hypothalamus controls autonomic functions
- It has roles in:
1. Sleep and wakefulness
2. Body temperature- Humans are homeothermic and control internal body temperature
3. Food intake
4. Water intake and loss
5. Sex and reproduction via Hormones and axons that project to the Cerebral Cortex
6. Directs stress response by influencing blood flow to specific tissues by acting as the first step in the stimulation of secretion of adrenal stress hormones

# Functions of the Hypothalamic Regions and their Nuclei

- Three regions of the Hypothalamus are destribed along the Anterior/Posterior (Rostral/Caudal) Axis based on prominent features that are visible in a Sagittal Section of the Brain:
1. Supraoptic/Anterior Region - Found at the level of the Optic Chiasm
2. Tuberal - Found at the Level of the Stalk of the Pituitary Gland and the Tuber Cinereum (Median Eminence - The bulge from which the Infundibulum extends into the Hypophysis)
3. Mammillary/Posterior Region - Found at the level of the Mammillary Bodies

### Supraoptic/Anterior Region

1. This is where the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei are found
- They are neurosecretory and produce the hormones secreted by the posterior pituitary
1. The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is also an important source of axons which go down to autonomic centres in the brainstem (parasympathetic) and spinal cord (sympathetic in the lateral horn of the Spinal Cord)
2. The suprachiasmatic nucleus, above the Optic chiasm, receives fibres from the retina via the Optic Nerve and is involved in controlling diurnal rhythms by a complicated pathway involving the pineal gland
- The suprachiasmatic nucleus projects to the pineal gland which produces melatonin which controls diurnal rhythm

### Tuberal/Middle Region

- This contains the arcuate nucleus, ventromedial nucleus and the lateral hypothalamic nucleus
- The arcuate nucleus is just above the stalk of the pituitary gland and decussates
- This nucleus contains leptin receptors which helps to control appetite

### Mamillary/Posterior Region

- This consists of the posterior hypothalamic nucleus and the mammillary nuclei
- It may also play a role in thermoregulation
- The mammillary nuclei play a role in memory

### Sexually Dimorphic Nuclei in the Anterior Part of the Hypothalamus

- There are a number of studies which report sexual dimorphism in other hypothalamic nuclei and even a correlation between the size of some nuclei and sexual orientation
- For example, one study reported that the volume and cell number in part of the
suprachiasmatic nucleus of homosexual men was twice as large as that of a reference group
- The Medial Preoptic Nucleus/Sexually Dimorphic Nucleus generates Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone and its growth is regulated by Testosterone exposure in utero (hence 2x larger in men than women)
- Its role in both sexes related to sexual behaviour and partner preferences
- Another study reported that the volume of the SDN-POA in the Preoptic nucleus was 2.2x larger and contained 2.1x more cells in men vs females
- This kind of dimorphism is also seen relating to sexual preference in sheep and rams

# Regulation of Body Temperature by the Hypothalamus

- The anterior hypothalamus (preoptic area) receives lots of information regarding the temperature of the body and mediates loss of heat
- This is achieved by monitoring the temperature of the blood going through the hypothalamus
- If it is stimulated (E.g electrically), it causes heat loss through dilation of blood vessels in the skin, panting and suppression of shivering (PSNS Effects)
- Lesions can cause chronic hyperthermia
- More posteriorly, the hypothalamus mediates heat conservation:
- Lesions can cause hypothermia if an animal is placed in a cold environment
- Microsimulation causes shivering and constriction of blood vessels in the skin (SNS Effects)
- In addition, as the axons controlling body temperature go out the back of the hypothalamus, so lesions to this region cut off all aspects of body temperature control, so the patient may end up as essentially “cold blooded” and have to monitor their body temperature all the time
- The temperature control is achieved by autonomic and behavioural changes to keep the body temperature the same

# Regulation of Food Intake by the Hypothalamus

- The hypothalamus manages to maintain food intake relative to energy usage
- Appetite goes up proportionally with exercise
- Lesions in the Ventromedial Aspect (Tuberal Region) of the Hypothalamus leads to Hyperphagia and Obesity whereas Lesions of the Lateral Hypothalamus in the Tuberal Region lead to Aphagia and starvation
- There is a lateral feeding centre and medial satiety centre:
- Bilateral lesions in the lateral feeding centre) results in aphagia (lack of desire to feed/appetite) in rats and starvation
- This is called lateral hypothalamic syndrome
- If the more medial satiety centre in the tuberal region are lesioned, this results in hyperphagia (extreme desire for food/appetite) and obesity
- This is called ventromedial hypothalamic syndrome
- Some neurosurgeons have tried to stimulate the medial satiety centre in obese patients:
- This is difficult due to how small the nuclei in the hypothalamus
- However, the individual performed better in memory tests
- It is likely the electrodes were stimulating the mammary-thalamic tract involved in the Circuit of Papez

# Fluid Regulation and Regulation of Wakefulness by the Hypothalamus

### Fluid Regulation

- The hypothalamus measures osmolarity of the blood and projects to the Hypothalamic Thirst Network, which in turn sends axons up to the Cerebral Cortex to influence behaviour (increase thirst etc.)
- It can also stimulate the release of Vasopressin/ADH

![%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.47.46.png](%5B033%5D%20Forebrain%20III%20ce25f505ce8f4256a6cd5741f8ab52b5/Screen_Shot_2021-07-16_at_15.47.46.png)

### Regulation of Wakefulness

- The tuberomammillary nucleus in the lateral region of the hypothalamus contains histaminergic neurons that extend axons to most parts of the CNS
- It is the only Histaminergic Nucleus in the CNS
- They regulate wake-sleep cycles as well as carrying out other functions
- These neurons project both to cerebral cortex and other centres that help control wakefulness e.g. the locus coeruleus
- They have diffuse, highly collateralised cortical projections and their firing seems particularly closely related to the regulation of wake-sleep cycles
- Antihistamines that penetrate the blood brain barrier are thus soporifics (induce drowsiness or sleep) by blocking the action of these Histaminergic Fibres
