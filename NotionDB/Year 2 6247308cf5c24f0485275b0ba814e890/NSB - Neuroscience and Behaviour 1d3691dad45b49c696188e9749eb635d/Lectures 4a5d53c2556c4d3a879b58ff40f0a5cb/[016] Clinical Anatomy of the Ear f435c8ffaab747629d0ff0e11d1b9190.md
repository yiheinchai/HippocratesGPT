# [016] Clinical Anatomy of the Ear

# Overview

- The Anterior Semicircular Canal creates a bony eminence on the Anterior Aspect of the Petrous Temporal Bone in the Middle Cranial Fossa called the Arcuate Eminence
- It contains 3 regions - The external, middle and inner ear, all of which are found embedded within part of the Petrous Part of the Temporal Bone
- Otic Placodes (Ectodermal) and PA1 give rise rise to the ear structures
- This means that the ear is formed relatively early on in development, with balance and sense of location sense developing very early on, followed slightly later than Hearing
- The Anterior Semicircular Canal is found near the Arcuate Eminence, with many other inner ear structures found underneath this eminence
- The Internal Acoustic Meatus opens into the Inner Ear and conveys vasculature and CN VIII

# External Ear

- Much of the Auricle has a supporting elastic fibrocartilaginous framework onto which skin is firmly attached, allowing it to be painlessly deformed
- The surface of the Auricle is thrown into depressions and folds/eminences to collect and channel sound waves towards the External Acoustic Meatus and allow for accurate determination of their direction
- Humans do not have very mobile ears compared to other mammals. There are minimal muscles which help shape the Auricular Cartilage and position the ear but the use of the muscles varies widely
- Helix = Outermost folded/curved rim of the Auricle. This is continuous inferiorly with the Lobule
- The Lobule is fleshy and lacks any fibrocartilaginous framework
- Antihelix = A raised ridge of Auricle, found just medial to the Helix
- Medial and deep to the Antihelix lies a flattened region of the Auricle called the Concha (As it looks like the inside of a shell - Hearing Aid Moulds are designed to have an airtight fit into the Concha and External Meatus)
- The Tragus is a small spur of Fibrocartilage that projects medially to cover the Anterior opening of the External Meatus
- The External Auditory Meatus is the region of the Ear canal that connects the External and Middle ear (Ends medially at the Tympanic Membrane)
- In a newborn, the External Auditory Meatus is quite short
- In an adult, the outer 1/3rd of the External Auditory Meatus is cartillaginous and only the Inner 2/3rds of the Meatus is walled by bone (mainly the Tympanic Plate of the Temporal Bone)
- The External Auditory Meatus forms an S-Shaped curve, first curving anteriorly and then posteriorly, finally anteroinferiorly to reach the Tympanic Membrane
- The Tympanic Membrane is not perpendicular to the walls of the External Acoustic Meatus but is placed obliquely (Superolaterally) so that the Anterior wall and Floor of the Meatus are longer than the Posterior Wall and Floor
- Therefore, in order to straighten the Meatus for auriscopic examination, the Auricle must be pulled superoposteriorly

![f008-114-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/f008-114-9780323393041.jpeg)

# External Ear Innervation

- The skin of the pinna has a complex sensory innervation due to its embryonic origin:
- The Upper anterior quadrant is innervated by the Auriculotemporal Nerve of CN V3 (Superior to the External Acoustic Meatus)
- This innervates the Ascending Ramus of the Helix, the Tragus and the Superior Aspect of the External Ear Canal
- The Posterior half of the Upper Ear and lower anterior quadrant are innervated by spinal nerves C2 and C3 (Lesser Occipital and Greater Auricular Nerves respectively from Cervical Plexus)
- Facial nerve (VII) is scattered across auricle, external auditory meatus
- Vagus nerve (X) scattered across concha, ear canal

![f008-115-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/f008-115-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Tympanic Membrane

- This is concave (in a healthy individual) on its external surface and partially translucent, allowing parts of the Malleus to be visible where it is attached to the Membrane
- The Long Handle of the Malleus is attached to the Internal Surface of the Tympanic Membrane and can be seen as a raised streak projecting inferoposteriorly from the Anterior and Posterior Malleolar Folds to end inferiorly as the Umbo, located just inferior to the centre of the Tympanic Membrane
- At the Superior end of the Handle, the Lateral Process of the Malleus creates a rounded prominence on the membrane
- From the Superior End of the Long Handle of Malleus, Anterior and Posterior Malleolar Folds projecting towards the medial and lateral edges of the membrane respectively
- The Superior Region of the Tympanic Membrane, bounded inferiorly by the Posterior and Anterior Malleolar Folds and the Lateral Process of Malleus is the Pars Flaccida, which is highly vascular
- Where the Pars Flaccida is highly vascular, it appears more opaque than the Pars Tensa
- The Region of the Tympanic Membrane found inferior to the Posterior and Anterior Malleolar Folds, either side of the Long Handle of Malleus is the Pars Tensa
- The Tympanic Membrane is drawn inwards towards the Handle of Malleus so that the outer surface of the Membrane is Concave
- This means that the light from the Auroscope produces a Cone of Light in the Anteroinferior quadrant
- The External Auditory Meatus and the External Aspect of the Tympanic Membrane receive sensory innervation from the Auricular Branch of CN X superiorly and Auriculotemporal Nerve (Branch of CN V3) inferiorly

# Middle Ear - Tympanic Cavity

- Middle Ear = Tympanic Cavity - This is a small air-filled space within the Petrous Temporal Bone, bordered laterally by the Tympanic Membrane and Medially by the Oval and Round WIndows
- It communicates with the Pharynx anteriorly through the Auditory/Eustachian/Pharyngotympanic Tube and posteriorly with the Mastoid Antrum
- The Upper Part of the Tympanic Cavity is expanded Superior to the Ossicles to form the Epitympanic Recess
- The Middle Ear contains an Ossicle chain comprised of the Malleus, Incus and Stapes moving medially which connect the Tympanic Membrane to the Inner Ear
- These transmit vibrations across the Tympanic Cavity from the External Ear to the Fluids of the Inner Ear
- This allows for mechanical coupling between the vibration of the Tympanic Membrane and the vibrations of fluid within the Inner Ear
- It is irregularly shaped but defined by Anterior, Posterior, Medial and Lateral walls and then a Roof and a Floor
- Lateral Wall = Tympanic Membrane
- Medial Wall = Bone of the Inner Ear. It has lots of grooves and eminences/ridges produced by the structures within the Bone of the Inner Ear
- The Promontory is a rounded elevation on the Medial Wall of the Middle Ear formed by the underlying Cochlea
- Just Posterior to the Promontory, there are 2 openings in the bone of the Medial Wall of the Tympanic Cavity which lead to the Bony Cavities of the Inner Ear
- The Superoposterior Opening is the Fenestra Vestibuli/Oval Window, closed in life by the Stapes
- The Inferoposterior Opening is the Fenestra Cochleae/Round Window, closed over by a Secondary Tympanic Membrane in life
- The Anterior Wall of the Tympanic Cavity leads to 2 canals, the Larger Auditory/Pharyngotympanic Tube found inferiorly and a Smaller Canal for the Tensor Tympani found superiorly
- The Tensor Tympani enters the Tympanic Cavity superior to the Auditory Tube and forms a delicate tendon, which bends laterally around a small bony pulley (Processus Trochleariformis) to insert onto the Handle of the Malleus
- Tensor Tympani is supplied by the Tensor Tympani Nerve from CN V3
- The Tensor Tympani runs alongside the Auditory Tube (closely associated) and alongside the Soft Palate Muscles, they help to close the Auditory Tube near its Anterior End
- The Carotid Canal is related to the Anterior Wall of the Middle Ear, with only a thin lamina of bone separating the two
- In the Posterior Wall of the Tympanic Cavity, the Aditus to the Mastoid Cavity leads from the Epitympanic Recess into the Mastoid Antrum posteriorly
- Just inferior to the Aditus, a small Pyramidal Eminence is found, containing the Stapedius (Smallest muscle in the body)
- The Stapedius Tendon emerges from the Summit of this Pyramid and runs medially to insert onto the Neck of the Stapes
- The Stapedius and Tensor Tympani stabilise the excursions of the ossicles when they vibrate to prevent the dislocation of the Ossicle Chain when listening to loud sounds
- The Stapedius stabilises the Stapes and Dampens its vibrations whereas the Tensor Tympani dampens sound vibrations from the Tympanic Membranes

![f008-124-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/f008-124-9780323393041.jpeg)

- Roof = Tegmen Tympani (Part of Petrous Temporal Bone). This is inferior to the Temporal Lobe
- The Floor of the Tympanic Cavity is related to the Jugular Foramen and the Internal Jugular Vein

![f008-119-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/f008-119-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Ossicle Chain of the Middle Ear

- The Malleus (Looks like Hammer), Incus and Stapes within the Tympanic Cavity articulate with each other via Synovial Joints (smallest synovial joints in the body)
- The Head of the Malleus head lies in the Epitympanic Recess and is held there by Ligaments
- The Handle of Malleus is firmly attached to the Inner Surface of the Tympanic Membrane.
- The Head of the Incus forms a Saddle Synovial Joint with the Malleus
- The Incus has a Short Process/Limb that is anchored to the wall of the Epitympanic Recess and a long process that articulates with the Head of the Stapes at a tiny Ball and Socket Synovial Joint
- The Long Process of the Incus runs posteroinferiorly, parallel to the Long Handle of the Malleus
- The Foot plate/Base of the Stapes fits into and closes the Fenestra Vestibuli/Oval Window of the Inner Ear
- The SA of attachment of the Malleus on the Tympanic Membrane is much larger than that of the Stapes Floor Plate on the Oval Window
- This reduction in the contact SA means that as vibrations are conducted down the Ossicle Chain, the Force per unit area increases around 20x
- This amplifies the sound being conducted so that sound that travels  well in air can also travel well in the Inner Ear Fluid

# Auditory Tube

- The Auditory/Pharyngotympanic Tube passes obliquely/anteromedially towards the Pharynx, initially through the Petrous Temporal Bone but is continued more medially to the Pharynx as a Cartilaginous Tube (Posterior 1/3rd towards the Ear is Bony but the Anterior 2/3rd towards the Pharynx is Cartilaginous)
- The Cartilaginous Part and the Petrous Temporal Bone is much shorter and wider in children than in adults, meaning it does not close as tightly as it does in adults
- This also means that there is a shorter passageway in Children between the Nasal Cavity and the Tympanic Cavity, increasing the risk of tracking infections from the Nasopharynx into the Middle Ear
- This tube connects the Anterior wall of the Tympanic Cavity which transmits the the Nasopharynx
- When the Internal Carotid Artery enters the Cavernous Sinus, it leaves the Petrous Temporal Bone via its Superoanterior Most Tip, a region which found just superior to the Cartilaginous Part of the Auditory Tube (Foramen Lacerum is also found in this region superior to the Auditory Tube)
- It is accompanied by the wider Tensor Tympani Canal, which acts as the origin of the Tensor Tympani Muscle anteriorly, travelling through this canal to insert onto the Tympanic Membrane
- The Auditory Tube acts as a protective mechanism for the middle ear by allowing pressure to be equalised on both sides of the Tympanic Membrane (Specifically the Nasopharynx and Middle Ear) at all times (Pressure within the Pharynx = Pressure in the External Ear) in order to allow for the free vibration of the Tympanic Membrane, which would be dampened by a pressure gradient across this Membrane
- This tube is opened during swallowing and yawning, with the cartilaginous part being related to several muscles which are active then to open the tube
- This can become blocked in URTs
- The Mucous Membrane of the Auditory Tube is innervated by CN IX

![f008-122-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/f008-122-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Mastoid Antrum and Mastoid Process

- This is an air sinus within the Petrous Temporal Bone, posterior to the Middle Ear/Tympanic Cavity
- It is the only air sinus that is well developed at birth, although the Mastoid Process is not formed at this time
- It is important clinically as it allows for infections to spread into and from the Middle Ear
- Anteriorly, it opens into the Epitympanic Recess via the Aditus and Posteriorly, it is connected to the Sigmoid Sinus (posteriorly, the Mastoid Bone can be quite thin)
- The Roof of the Antrum is related to the Brain and the Medial Wall of the Antrum is related to the Posterior Semicircular Canal
- The Mastoid process begins to develop at Age 2.
- At this time, the air cells gradually extend into it from the Mastoid Antrum and the cavities formed by these air cells are continuous with the air-containing mastoid antrum and Tympanic Cavity
- Occasionally, air cells are found in other parts of the Petrous Temporal Bone as well as the Mastoid Antrum
- The Mucosa is a modified respiratory epithelium
- The Mucous Membrane of the Mastoid Air Cells is innervated by the Nervus Spinosus from CN V3 (which passes through the Foramen Spinosum to reach the Mastoid Air Cells) and CN IX Fibres that innervate the Middle Ear

![f008-121-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/f008-121-9780323393041.jpeg)

# Otitis Media

- This is when there is an infection of the Middle Ear
- This is more common in children and usually result due to infections of the Pharynx tracking into the Tympanic Cavity
- These infections can pass into the Mastoid Air Cells via the Epitympanic Recess
- Otitis Media often arises from infections of the Pharynx that travel up the Auditory Tube to enter the Middle Ear so children with Cleft Palates are especially susceptible to Otitis Media (due to Eustachian Tube dysfunction due to deformities in the Palate Muscles)
- In Middle Ear Infections, the Tympanic Membrane can appear red and swollen, with no Cone of Light
- Occasionally, one needs to Incise the Tympanic Membrane in order to drain the Tympanic Cavity
- As the Pars Flaccida (Superior Half of Membrane) is extremely vascular, has the Chorda Tympani running across its internal surface and is the attachment site for the Long Handle of Malleus, incisions in the Tympanic Membrane are made in the Posteroinferior Quadrant as it is avoids damaging important structures and is the most avascular region of the Tympanic Membrane
- Sx = Ear Pan, Bulging immobile Tympanic Membrane (Tympanic Membrane bulges into the External Acoustic Meatus to become convex) and temporary hearing loss
- In severe or chronic cases, the Tympanic Membrane can be damaged
- Whilst this damage in the Tympanic Membrane helps drain some of the Infective Exudate to relieve the pressure on the Ear Drum, Hearing is compromised whilst the Tympanic Membrane is healing
- This can be used clinically where incisions are created in the Tympanic Membrane and a Grommit is inserted. This drains the Middle Ear and the incision can then be closed later on
- Complications include:
1. Permanent Loss of Hearing due to damage of the Ossicles and/or the Tympanic Membrane
2. Meningitis,Encephalitis and Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis (via the thin Roof of the Tympanic Cavity into the Intracranial Region)
3. Mastoiditis

# Neurovascular Structures in the Tympanic Cavity

### CN VII/Facial Nerve

### Path of the Facial Nerve in the Petrous Bone

- For a short distance within the Proximal aspect of the Internal Acoustic Meatus, CN VII and CN VIII travel together alongside the Labyrinthine Artery
- CN VII enters the Petrosal Temporal Bone via the Internal Acoustic Meatus to run medially along the Internal Acoustic Meatus until it reaches the Medial Wall of the Tympanic Cavity, near its border with the Lateral Wall of the Tympanic Cavity
- Afferents of CN VII have their cell bodies within the Genicular Ganglion, found in the Medial Wall of the Tympanic Cavity, near to its boundary with the Lateral wall
- Here, CN VII turns a right angle, now running laterally instead of inferiorly, to run along the superior margin of the Medial Wall of the Tympanic Cavity in its own canal (posterior to the Tympanic Cavity)
- When it reaches the Posterior most Margin of the Medial Walls of the Tympanic Cavity, it turns another right angle, now running inferiorly instead of laterally, to run out of the Petrous Temporal Bone and Skull via the Stylomastoid Foramen on the Posteromedial Aspect of the Temporal Cavity

### Branches of the Facial Nerve

- While in its tunnel within the Petrous Temporal Bone, before it runs posterior to the Tympanic Cavity, the Facial Nerve gives off several branches:
1. Nerve to Stapedius
2. Chorda Tympani
3. Lesser and Greater Petrosal Nerves

**Nerve to Stapedius**

- This arises from CN VII just before it bends to run posterior to the Tympanic Cavity
- This runs anteriorly to enter the Tympanic Cavity of the Ear where it innervates Stapedius
- Paralysis of the Stapedius due to damage to the Nerve to Stapedius leads to Hyperacusia, where sounds appear quieter than they should

**Chorda Tympani**

- This branch arises from CN VII within the bony facial canal, posterior to the Tympanic Cavity, as it approaches the Stylomastoid Foramen
- It then runs anteriorly, over the Pars Flaccida of the Tympanic Membrane and Long Handle of the Malleus to eventually leave the skull by running through the Lateral Aspect of the Tympanic Cavity
- This carries afferent taste fibres from the tongue and Secretomotor Fibres to the Submandibular and Sublingual Salivary Glands

# Blood Supply and Drainage to the Outer Ear

- The Outer ear is supplied by the Superior Temporal Artery, which arises from the External Carotid Artery
- This is the terminal branch of the ECA and travels anteriorly to the Ear, up the Scalp, to supply the Lateral Aspect of the Neurocranium
- The Outer Ear is drained by the Pterygoid Venous Plexus of the Infratemporal Fossa, which drain into the External Jugular Veins and the Maxillary Veins

![Screenshot 2021-11-01 at 21.59.46.png](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/Screenshot_2021-11-01_at_21.59.46.png)

# Blood Supply and Drainage to the Middle Ear

- The Middle Ear is supplied by branches from the Lateral/Proximal 1/3rd of the Maxillary Artery from the External Carotid Artery (Deep Auricular Artery, Anterior Tympanic Artery etc.)
- There are small contributions from other External Carotid Branches such as the Stylomastoid Artery and Middle Meningeal Artery
- Venous Drainage is mixed, to the Pterygoid Venous Plexus and to the Superior Petrosal Sinus in the Intracranial Region

# Blood Supply and Drainage to the Inner Ear

- This is supplied by the Labyrinthine Artery
- Vertebral Arteries → Basilar Artery and/or Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (Branch of Basilar Artery) → Labyrinthine Artery
- The Labyrinthine Artery enters the Inner Ear via the Internal Acoustic Meatus, alongside CN VII and CN VIII, to the Inner Ear
- The Inner Ear is drained by Labyrinthine Veins, which run alongside CN VIII through the Internal Acoustic Meatus drain to the Greater Petrosal Sinus

![Screenshot 2021-11-01 at 23.31.48.png](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/Screenshot_2021-11-01_at_23.31.48.png)

# Lymphatic Drainage of the Ear

**Outer Ear:**

- Lymphatics drain to Pre- and postauricular, parotid, mastoid and deep cervical nodes for upper half the outer ear
- Lymphatics for the Lower Half of the Outer Ear drain to the Superficial cervical nodes

**Middle Ear:**

- Lymphatics here drain into the Parotid, sub-mandibular, superficial and deep cervical nodes depending on the specific position of the Tympanic Cavity being considered

**Inner Ear:**

- Parotid and superficial cervical nodes (It has minor Lymphatic Drainage)

# Inner Ear - Organs of Hearing and Balance

- Deepest part of the Petrous Temporal Bone contains a series of Bony Cavities and Canals called the Bony Labyrinth
- Canals = Bony Labyrinth and Ducts = Membranous Labyrinth
- The Bony Labyrinth are filled with Perilymph (Similar to CSF) and contains the Organs of Hearing and Balance (Membraneous Labyrinth)
- Endolymph is found within the Structures of the Membranous Labyrinth
- The Membranous Labyrinth is anchored to the Bony Labyrinth at Several Points so that it is not freely suspended in the Perilymph

![f008-129-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/f008-129-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Bony Labyrinth

- Vestibule = Centrally Placed Cavity between the Cochlea Medially and the Semicircular Canals laterally
- The 3 Semicircular Canals arise from the Posterior Surface of the Vestibule
- Anteriorly, the Vestibule connects to the Cochlea, a curled bony canal.
- The Composition of Perilymph closely resembles that of CSF
- The Aqueduct of the Cochlea passes through the Petrous Temporal Bone from the Cochlea to the Jugular Foramen and then, into the Subarachnoid Space
- It is postulated that there is CSF Flow from the Subarachnoid Space into the Cochlea along this Aqueduct to contribute to Perilymph. However, Perilymph also likely arises from Transudate from Blood Vessels in the walls of the Bony Labyrinth
- Perilymph may also be removed from the Bony Labyrinth via the Aqueduct but other mechanisms of removal are also likely
- The Fenestra Vestibuli/Oval Window and Fenestra Cochlea/Round Window are openings on the Lateral wall of the Vestibule, with the Oval Window found superior to the Round Window (Round Window is found on the Anterior Edge of the Cochlea
- Movement of the Stapes transmits pressure waves to the Perilymph of the Vestibule at the Oval Window
- On the Superior Surface of the Bony Labyrinth, there is a Canal for the CN VII, which which runs anteriorly, just above the Fenestra Vestibuli

# Cochlea

- This is a shell-shaped sinuous tunnel which runs anteriorly from the medial aspect of the Vestibule, with approximately 2.75 turns
- Cupula = Apex of the Cochlea which lies deep to the Medial Wall of the Tympanic Cavity
- The First Turn of the Cochlea produces a raised region of the Medial Wall of the Tympanic Cavity (Promontory)
- The Cochlea is wound/spirals around a sagittal central axis called the Modiolus
- The Cochlear Canal is divided into a superior and inferior segment by a bony spiral lamina (Lamina of the Modiolus), which project from the Central Column of the Cochlea transversely  through the The Cochlear Canal to form the inner half of this division
- The Division of the Cochlear Canals is further completed peripherally by a Basilar Membrane peripherally and Vestibular Membranes running peripherally obliquely, which both stretch laterally from the lateral edge of the Spiral Lamina to the outer wall of the Canal
- This divides the Cochlear Canal into a more superior Scala Vestibuli and more inferior Scala Tympani

![Gray928.png](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/Gray928.png)

- The Scala Vestibuli and Tympani are continuous at the Apex of the Cochlea, called the Helicotrema
- Vibrations in the Perilymph (created by the Movement of the Footplate of the Stapes) travel along the Scala Vestibuli to the Apex of the Cochlea.
- From Here, vibrations pass through the Helicotrema into the Scala Tympani, and then downwards to the base of the Cochlea and the Fenestra Cochleae (Closed over by the Secondary Tympanic Membrane)
- The Fenestra Vestibuli is the opening of the Scala Vestibuli into the Vestibule of the Cochlea and the Fenestra Cochleae is the opening of the Scala Tympani into the Vestibule of the Cochlea
- The transmission of Vibrations through the Scala Vestibuli and Tympani causes vibrations of the Secondary Tympanic Membrane overlaying the Fenestra Cochleae which are in the opposite direction to those of the Stapes
- This is done to ensure the Inner Ear remains a relatively constant volume during Vibration Transmission to prevent the Pressure of the Inner Ear Perilymph from becoming too excessive (Pressure Equiliser)
- Afferents from the Outer Hair Cells of the Basilar Membrane that contribute to the Organ of Corti run  centrally through the Spiral Lamina of the Modiolus towards the Modiolus
- These afferents have their cell bodies in the Spiral Ganglion within the Modiolus (Located near the Origin of the Spiral Laminae of the Modiolus) and combine to run down the Modiolus as the Cochlear Part of CN VIII

### Vestibulocochlear Nerve/CN VIII

- This is formed by the fusion of the Vestibular Nerve (from the Hair Cells in the Maculae and Ampullary Crests/Cupulae of the Utricle and Saccule) and Cochlear Nerve (from the Organs of Corti), relaying Auditory and Vestibular (Balance) information to the Brain via the Internal Acoustic Meatus
- The Cell Bodies of these Afferents are located in the Spiral Ganglia of the Cochlea

# Cochlear Duct and Basilar Membrane in Hearing

### Cochlear Duct and its Contents

- It is a spirally arranged tube which starts inferiorly at the Ductus Reuniens and spirals to a closed end near the Apex of the Cochlea.
- This is found outside/peripheral to the Scala Vestibuli and Tympani, between these
- It is filled with Endolymph
- The Floor of the Duct is formed by the Basilar Membrane, which stretches from the Spiral Bony Laminar to the Outer Wall of the Cochlear Canal - This forms the Roof of the Scala Tympani
- The Roof is formed by the Vestibular Membrane, which also extends from the Spiral Bony Lamina to the Outer Surface of the Canal - This forms the Floor of the Scala Vestibuli
- The common attachment site of the Vestibular and Basilar Membrane to the Spiral Bony Lamina means the Cochlear Duct is triangular in shape
- Above the Peripheral Attachment of the Basilar Membrane, the Outer Wall of the Cochlear Duct presents a rounded Prominence/Indentation into the Cochlear Duct that runs along and spirals with the Cochlear Duct .
- The epithelium overlying and above this Prominence but below the Peripheral Attachment of the Vestibular Membrane is highly vascular and forms the Stria Vascularis
- This is thought to be concerned with the production of Endolymph as well as with the homeostasis of its ionic contents

![f008-132-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/f008-132-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Spiral Organ of Corti

- At the Peripheral Aspect of the Basilar Membrane (Just at the Inner margin of the Spiral Prominence of the Outer Wall of the Cochlear Duct), the Spiral Organ of Corti is found
- This is the specialised receptor organ for hearing and is composed of Various parts
- It converts sound energy into chemical signals that are transmitted via the Cochlear Nerve of CN VIII towards the Brain
- Adjacent regions of Inner (More Central) and Outer (More Peripheral) Hair Cells that sit on the surface of the Basilar Membrane within the Cochlear Duct slope towards one another to form the Tunnel of Corti Between them.
- The Outer Hairs/Stereocilia of Hair Cells are embedded in a fibrogelatinous membrane, which overlies the surface of the Spiral Organ of Corti and is known as the Tectorial Membrane
- The Stereocilia of the Inner Hair Cells are not covered by the Tectorial Membrane
- When a Pressure wave is conducted down the Scala Tympani, this causes vibration of the Basilar Membrane and hence, the Organ of Corti
- This causes the Hair Cells within the Organ of Corti to move relative to the Vestibular Membrane, causing deflection of the Stereocilia, depolarising the associated Hair Cell, leading to the generation of an Afferent AP down the Cochlear Nerve
- The Basilar Membrane is narrower and stiffer at the Base of the Cochlea and wider and more elastic at the Apex of the Cochlea
- As the tension of the Basilar Membrane increases, its vibration frequency due to a mechanical stimulus increases
- This means that different frequencies displace the Basilar Membrane at different locations along the Cochlear Duct (High Frequencies displace the Basilar Membrane close to the base and Low Frequencies displace the Basilar Membrane near the Apex)
- The Longer the Cochlea, the Lower the Frequencies are that can displace the Basilar Membrane and be heard

# Inner Ear Membranous Labyrinths

- They are membranous sacs found within the Bony Labyrinth and are filled with Endolymph
- These form the organs of Hearing and Balance
- Within the Vestibule there are 2 sacs of Endomorph, the Utricle laterally (connected to the Semicircular Ducts) and the Saccule medially (connected to the Cochlear Duct which runs in the Cochlear Canal)
- From the Medial surface of the Utricle and the Lateral Surface of the Saccule, 2 thin ducts arise that fuse to form the Endolymphatic Duct
- This extends through the Petrous Temporal Bone in the Bony Aqueduct of the Vestibule to come to lie against the Dura Mater in the Posterior Cranial Fossa on the Posterior Aspect of the Petrous Temporal Bone (The Dura here covers a hole in the Petrous Bone)
- Here, Endolymph from the Membranous Labyrinths is reabsorbed into the circulating blood stream via a Vascular Plexus in the Specialised Endothelium underlying the Dura Mater in this region

# Saccule and Utricle

- The Saccule is joined to the Cochlear Duct medially by the Ductus Reuniens
    
    ![Scannable Document on 7 Nov 2021 at 6_15_41 pm.png](%5B016%5D%20Clinical%20Anatomy%20of%20the%20Ear%20f435c8ffaab747629d0ff0e11d1b9190/Scannable_Document_on_7_Nov_2021_at_6_15_41_pm.png)
    

### Maculae

- The Saccule and Utricle contains specialised neuroepithelium that is sensitive to the pull of Gravity
- Part of the wall of the Utricle and Saccule are thickened by this specialised organ/neuroepithelium to form Maculae, where there is a high [Hair Cells]
- The Macula of the Saccule is located perpendicular (In the Sagittal Plane) to the Macula to the Utricle (which is located in the Transverse Plane) and therefore, the Macula of the Saccule is more sensitive to changes in Vertical head position/acceleration and that of the Utricle is more sensitive to changes in Horizontal Head Position/Acceleration
- These signal alterations in head position (linear acceleration) with reference to the pull of Gravity in the sagittal or transverse plane (Sense of Orientation of the Head)
- Much of the Information sensed by the Maculae produces appropriate alterations in muscle tone throughout the body, notably the supporting muscles of the neck and extraocular muscles
- The Maculae are therefore referred to as the Organs of Static Balance (Otolith Organ)
- The Epithelium of the Maculae and of the Ampullary Crests  is comprised of Hair Cells and Supporting Cells
- The bases of most hair cells are associated with nerve terminals from afferent fibres of the Vestibular Nerve
- Each Macula is covered/overlain by a Gelatinous Mass/Otolithic Membrane, containing Crystaline Bodies/Otoconia or Otoliths (Calcium Carbonate Granules/Ear-Sand)
- Movements of the Head can alter the movement of the Otoliths in the Otolithic Membrane, where they can displace Hair Cells to trigger an AP also embedded in these membranes
- Alterations in the position of head, relative to the line of gravity, result in drag/leaning of the Otolithic membrane on the Hair Cells in the direction that the head is leaning
- A Combination of the Left and Right Otolith Organs sense any head orientation (in relation to the body) in any direction

### Ampullary Crests

- These signal changes in angular acceleration of the head instead of static balance
- The Walls of the Ampulae contain the Crista Ampullaris, a ridge of sensory cells which detect the movement of the Endolymph within the Semicircular Canals (which displaces during movement)
- The Crista Ampullaris is covered by a gelatinous dome-shaped Cupula, which extends across the entire width of the Ampullary Crest to entirely block off the flow of endolymph around the Semicircular Canals
- The very small and sensitive Sterocilia of Hair Cells on the Ampullary Crest are embedded into the substance of the Cupula
- Drag and Movement of the Endolymph generated when there is angular movement/acceleration of the Head causes Endolymph to press up against the Cupula and move it from side to side
- This movement of the Cupula distorts the Stereocilia which stimulates the hair cells, which discharge nerve impulses accordingly down the Vestibular Nerve
- Vestibular Nerve fibres have a continuous basal discharge rate but bending the Cupula to one side increases the discharge frequency and bending of the Cupula to the other side decreases the discharge frequency
- The 90° Orientation of the Anterior, Posterior and Lateral Semicircular Canals to one another and the combination of Left and Right Ear Otolith Receptors, this allows you to detect deceleration in all directions, enabling balance in movement and assisting eye tracking when moving (as you are aware of where your head is moving, allowing opposing eye movements to occur to maintain gaze)

# Semicircular Canals and their Ampullae

- They run posteriorly from the Lateral Aspect of the Vestibule and are named Anterior/Superior, Posterior and Lateral
- At their distal end, each of them has organs sensitive to body movement
- The Anterior and Posterior Canals are orientated vertically in the Sagittal Plane whilst the Posterior Canal lies in the Long Axis of the Petrous Body Canal in the Transverse Plane (perpendicular to the Anterior Canal)
- When the head is horizontal, the Anterior Canal is is found at and extends to a higher level than the Posterior Canal
- Near where the Semicircular Ducts open into the Utricle, they are dilated to form Ampullae, with each containing an internal projection called the Ampullary Crest

# Summary of the Mechanisms of Hearing

1. Sound Vibrations are collected by the Pinna and transmitted through the External Acoustic Meatus to the Tympanic Membrane, causing it to vibrate
2. Vibration of the Tympanic Membrane are transmitted to the Ossicles, towards the Inner Ear,
3. Vibration of the Stapes is transmitted across the Oval Window to create pressure waves in the fluid of the Vestibule
4. These Pressure waves are conducted via the Perilymph of the Scala Vestibuli, across the Helicotrema, and down the Scala Tympani to the Basilar and Vestibular Membranes that separate them
- The Cochlear System cannot be completely closed off or else pressure within the System would rise excessively. Therefore, every inward bending of the Oval Window produces a pressure wave through the Scala Vestibuli, around the Apex of the Cochlea, across the Helicotrema and through the Scala Tympani is then dissipated as outward movement of the Secondary Tympanic Membrane of the Round Window
1. Vibrations of the Basilar Membrane causes the Organ of Corti to move relative to the Tectorial Membrane
2. This leads to Sheer/Deflection of the Stereocilia of the Hair Cells, depolarising the membrane to lead to the firing of an AP down Afferents that are connected to the Hair Cells
- Larger Movement of the Organ of Corti due to more intense sounds increases the frequency of depolarisation

# Vertigo and Deafness(D&P But Not In Lectures)

### Vertigo

- Can be caused by:
1. Labyrinthitis (Inflammation of Membraneous Labyrinth)
2. Menière's Disease - This is due to overproduction of Endolymph, increasing the pressure within the Membraneous Labyrinth, leading to degradation of the Hair Cells in the Maculae
3. Syringing Wax out of the External Auditory Meatus with water that is much colder/warmer than Body Temperature - This produces endolymph movement, leading to Dizziness

### Deafness

- Can be caused by:
1. CN VIII Lesion
2. Mechanical Disruption of Sound Transmission via the Ossicle Chain (Between Tympanic Membrane and Oval Window) - This is notably seen in Congenital Fixation of the Stapes to the Oval Window
