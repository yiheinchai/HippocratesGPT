# Clinical Assessment of Hearing Loss

- Evaluation of patient’s hearing problems begins with simple observation.
- Observation of manner, voice and his hearing for conversation at first consultation may provide a rough indication of nature and degree of hearing disability.
- Patient who watches a speaker closely may be proficient at lip reading.
- Voice is often soft in conductive disability and flat and toneless with sensori-neural loss.
- When a louder than normal voice is required for communication in a small consulting room, significant hearing handicap is probable.

# Clinical History

- Time and age of onset of loss of hearing.
- Illness, accident or other unusual circumstances at onset.
- Concurrent symptoms, vestibular disturbances, pain or fullness in ear, headache, neurological disturbance, infection of ear or respiratory tract, tinnitus.
- Personal history:
1. Acute infectious diseases
2. Aural infections
3. Respiratory infections
4. Noise exposure: industrial (e.g. factory machine noise, road rills), loud music (e.g. musicians).
5. Drugs: neomycin, gentamicin, streptomycin.
- Trauma to head.
- Familial history:
1. Loss of hearing in parent or siblings.
2. German measles/Rubella during first trimester of mother’s pregnancy.
3. Conditions in which disability is apparent (e.g. talking in groups, noise).

# Air Vs Bone Conduction

- Air-conducted sound is transmitted to the inner ear via the outer and **middle** ear
- Bone-conducted sound bypasses the outer and **middle** ear and is transmitted directly to the inner ear via the bone
- If the outer and middle ear are normal, the ear is more sensitive to air-conducted sound than bone-conducted sound
- However, if the outer and middle ear are not working properly, the ear becomes:
1. less sensitive to air-conduction (because the middle ear is unable to amplify the sound)
2. more sensitive to bone-conduction.
- Normal Outer/Middle Ear Function =
Air-conduction > Bone-conduction
- Conductive Hearing Loss = Air-conduction ≤ Bone-conduction

### Why does Conductive Hearing Loss Make an Ear More Sensitive to Bone-Conducted Sound?

- If an ear has a conductive hearing loss, bone-conducted sound appears louder in that ear than normal because:
1. Bone-conducted sound will be unable to escape from the inner ear, which enhances its effect (the middle ear allows sound to both enter and exit the inner ear)
2. Ambient background noise will be much quieter because it is unable to enter the ear via air-conduction
3. Over a prolonged period of Conductive Hearing Loss, the inner ear may upregulate its sensitivity to sound to compensate for the lack of air-conducted sound

# Hum Test

- When one ear is blocked, people typically hear the humming of their own voice louder in the blocked ear.
- This makes it appear as if the sound is coming from the side of the blocked ear. This works because:
1. Humming causes the bones in your head to vibrate. These vibrations are then transmitted to your inner ear via the bone (bone-conducted sound).
2. Blocking an ear (and real outer- and middle-ear problems) can make bone conducted sound appear louder in the blocked ear
3. When sound is louder in one ear, there is an Interaural Level Difference, which is interpreted by the brain as a cue to sound location. So the apparent position of the sound inside your head
moves.

# Rinne’s Test and Weber’s Test

- These tests determine whether deafness is conductive or sensorineural.
- Conductive deafness = Defect in transmission of sound from outside world to cochlea (Outer or Middle Ear).
- Sensori-neural deafness = Defect is in transmission of information from cochlea to auditory cortex (Inner Ear).
- Lower frequency is better for bone conduction.

### Weber’s Test

- Used to classify unilateral hearing loss (whether hearing is similar in two ears).
- Strike a tuning fork and place it on middle of patient’s head.
- Note where sound is best heard: left ear, right ear (lateralisation) or both equally.
- If sound is lateralised to one ear, there is either ipsilateral conductive hearing loss or contralateral sensorineural hearing loss
- This is because hearing loss causes the tuning fork to be louder in one ear (Interaural Level Difference) shifting the perceived position of the sound towards the louder ear
- If the sound is not lateralised (heard equally in both ears), there is either normal hearing or bilateral conductive/sensorineural hearing loss
- If Weber’s Test shows no lateralisation and Rinne’s Test is negative bilaterally, this indicates bilateral conductive hearing loss

### Rinne’s Test

- This tells us whether hearing loss is conductive (Auditory Pathways before the Cochlea) or Sensorineural (Auditory Pathway in or after the Cochlea)
- Opposite ear should be masked whilst testing one ear.
- To Test this, firmly place the tuning fork base on the mastoid process behind the ear.
- When the sound is no longer
heard by the subject (bone conduction),
immediately place the tines of
the tuning fork 1cm away from
the Opening to the External Acoustic Meatus
- Once you have done this, ask the subject whether they can still hear the sound and if they heard the sound louder via Bone vs Air Conduction.
- 256, 512 and 1,024 forks are most useful
- Forks of lower frequency may be felt as vibration, while those with higher frequency (which is preferred in these Tuning Fork Tests) are heard by air conduction (they do not travel through bone well) when bone conduction is tested.
- +ve Rinne (normal): air conduction is heard approximately twice as long as in bone conduction (Px will hear the tone made by the tuning fork as the subject is more sensitive to air vs bone conducted sound)
- -ve Rinne (abnormal): bone conduction is heard longer than air conduction (Px does not hear the tone made by the tuning fork as the subject is more sensitive to bone than air conduction).
- If an ear shows a positive result for Rinne’s test, it does not have a conductive hearing loss (it may be normal OR have a sensorineural hearing loss).
- If an ear shows a negative result for Rinne’s test, it has a conductive hearing loss if Weber’s test lateralizes to that same ear (Rinne’s Test should be done first to rule out Conductive Hearing Loss then Weber’s Test should be conducted to confirm type of Hearing Loss).

# Pure Tone Audiometry

- Employed principally to:
1. Assist in making diagnosis or auditory pathology (including malingering and psychogenic aberrations).
2. Ascertain type and severity of impairment in relation to suitability for rehabilitative middle ear surgery.
3. Periodically check progress of auditory sensitivity following surgery or drugs.
4. Serve as a guide in selection of rehabilitative procedures for patients with handicapping irreversible hearing impairments.
- How we localise sound:
1. Time taken for sound to travel to both ears.
2. Shape of ear.
3. Type of sound: easier to use non-pure sounds (i.e. clicking or clapping) as they contain more information than a pure tone.
- Simulating hearing impairment by blocking an ear: much harder because cannot use blocked ear to help localise sound (now dependent on just 1 ear).
- Minimum hearing angle:
1. 2 people use pure tone box to produce sounds.
2. Slowly move both sources closer towards same point until patient perceives it to be same point.

# AMPLIVOX Diagnostic Audiometer - Not Covered

### Air Conduction Threshold Measurement

- Fit air conduction headphones with red marked earphones on right ear and blue on left ear, adjusting headband as necessary.
- Ensure that opening in ear cushion is directly over ear canal and that moderate pressure is applied by headband, for better results.
- Set frequency control to 1,000 Hz and hearing level control to 60 dB.
- Depress interrupter button. Subject should indicate that tone is heard in ear selected for test.
- If there is severe impairment, tone will not be heard and hearing level should be ↑ in 1- dB steps until tone is heard.
- Hearing level control should be lowered in 5 dB steps until tone is lost and then ↑ by 5 dB for threshold to be checked and rechecked.
- Threshold of hearing: quietest level at which subject can identify tone when it is re-introduced by means of interrupter.
- Important to limit duration of test tone to 1-2 s, an always to interrupt when re-setting hearing level control.
- Having established threshold for 1,000 Hz, threshold for higher pure tone frequencies should be taken in sequence up to 8,000

# Understanding Audiograms

- An audiogram is a visual representation (graph) of a person’s hearing that plots the minimum sound intensity
(i.e. the level of the quietest sound) that can be heard by that person at a range of frequencies.
- This is referred to as a hearing threshold (i.e. it’s the threshold at which a sound becomes audible)
- dB reading is plotted on audiogram chart, a small circle being used as a symbol to indicate right ear measurements, and a small cross for left ear measurements.
- Results of audiogram are plotted in such a way that compares hearing of patient with that of average person.
- Audiometer is calibrated to ISO (International Organisation for Standardization) threshold levels for air conduction.
- According to this standard, absolute intensity of sound in watts/m² produced
by audiometer at each frequency is set in such a way that when an intensity of 0 dB is indicated, an average person will be at threshold for hearing at that frequency.
- Thus, points plotted at 0 dB are ‘normal’.
- Points lying at + 5 dB or greater (below the black line) indicate a hearing deficit (as sound needs to be played louder than normal to be heard).
- Points lying at -5 dB or -10 dB (above the black line) indicate better than normal average hearing (as sound can be played quieter than usual to be hard).
- If someone’s threshold is >+20 dB worse than the average, then the person is said to have hearing loss.
- In such cases, the magnitude of the average threshold in comparison to the black baseline of 0 dB indicates the severity of hearing loss (mild, moderate, severe, or profound).
- You can also plot the Loudest sound that a Px can hear comfortably (without pain).
- The difference between the Maximum Tolerable Sound Intensity and the Hearing Threshold is the Dynamic Range of Hearing
- The Difference between the Lowest and Highest Frequencies that a Px can hear is known as the Functional Hearing Range

### Thresholds

- Thresholds can be measured using either air-conduction earphones or bone-conduction earphones.

**Air-Conduction Earphones**

- Air-conduction earphones are essentially ‘regular’ earphones: they cause the air in the ear canals to vibrate, which moves the tympanic membrane and activates the ossicular chain.
- Normal sensitivity to air-conducted sounds relies on the middle ear working properly.

**Bone Conduction Earphones**

- Bone-conduction earphones are placed against the skull and cause the underlying bone to vibrate.
- These vibrations are transmitted through the bone to the inner ear, effectively bypassing the middle ear.
- Normal sensitivity to bone-conducted sounds does not require the middle ear to work properly.
- If someone has middle ear problems and a healthy inner ear, they will show normal (or enhanced) sensitivity to bone-conducted sounds and show a loss of sensitivity to air-conducted sounds.
- Comparing air- and bone-conduction thresholds therefore allows diagnosis of middle ear problems.
- Normally, people are much more sensitive to air-conducted sound than bone-conducted sound.
- If this stops being the case, it is a sign of outer- or middle-ear dysfunction.
- This is important because various surgical interventions can be used to restore outer- or middle-ear function (e.g. tympanoplasty).
- Some forms of outer- and middle-ear problems may also resolve spontaneously or with minimal treatment (e.g. ear infections or earwax build-up).
- Currently, however, only hearing aids and cochlear implants can be used to compensate for inner-ear problems.

### Hearing Loss

- Mild Hearing Loss (20-40 dB) - Some sounds in speech become difficult to hear but the majority of sounds are still able to be heard clearly
- Moderate Hearing Loss (40-70 dB) - All human sounds in speech become difficult to hear but louder sounds can still be heard
- Severe Hearing Loss (70-90 dB)
- Profound Hearing Loss (>90 dB)

**Types of Hearing Loss**

- Presbyacusis - This is Age-Related High Frequency Hearing Loss where Lower Frequencies can still be heard at normal/average sound intensities but as the Frequency of the sound increases, the sound intensity needed to hear the sound also increases (Selective Loss of Higher Frequency Tones)

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 10.00.07.png](%5B062%5D%20Auditory%20Practical%20f560bf374d9040048e5d4c8a4d93df35/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_10.00.07.png)

- If there is a sudden and sharp Trough on an Audiogram (Usually at High Frequencies), this is indicative of Noise Damage to the Ear

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 10.00.58.png](%5B062%5D%20Auditory%20Practical%20f560bf374d9040048e5d4c8a4d93df35/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_10.00.58.png)

- In Meniere’s Disease, there is normal hearing in the Unaffected Ear but there is selective Low-Frequency Hearing Loss in the Affected Ear, with Minor Impairment of High Frequency Hearing (Degree of Hearing Loss can fluctuate over time)

# Understanding Measurements of Sound Intensity in Decibels (dB)

- Sound intensity is frequently expressed in terms of decibels (dB).
- Decibel (1/10 of a Bel) was named in honour of Alexander Graham Bell.
- Expresses logarithm to base 10 of ratio between 2 sound intensities or sound pressures.
- Relative Intensity in dB = $10log_{10}soundintensity(watts/m^2)$
- $dB = 10log_{10}\frac{SoundPressure^2}{ReferencePressure^2}$
- $dB = 20log_{10}\frac{SoundPressure}{ReferencePressure}$
- Internationally recognised reference standard intensity for sound is $10^{-12} watts/m^2$ which corresponds to a sound pressure of $2×10^{-5} N/m^2$ 
(Pascal).
- For a pure tone at 1,000 Hz, this is close to threshold hearing for young healthy adults.
- At around 120 dB, Sound waves start to become painful due to Hair Cell Damage

# Spacial Hearing

### Interaural Time and Level Differences

- If a sound is presented on one side of the head, it will be louder in the closer ear (i.e. an Interaural Level Difference will be created) and will arrive at the closer ear first (an Interaural Time Difference will be created).
- These binaural cues are used to locate sounds in the horizontal plane.
- A partial hearing loss in one ear will make sounds appear quieter in that ear, which will affect Interaural Level Differences.
- Certain forms of hearing loss may also delay the sound, which will affect Interaural Time Differences.
- Profound hearing loss will make one ear insensitive to sound, making it impossible for the brain to calculate either Interaural Time Differences or Interaural Level Differences.
- This can make it harder, if not impossible, to locate sounds.

![Screenshot 2022-01-10 at 19.18.09.png](%5B062%5D%20Auditory%20Practical%20f560bf374d9040048e5d4c8a4d93df35/Screenshot_2022-01-10_at_19.18.09.png)

### Adaptation to Hearing Loss

- If a Px has Hearing Loss, Compensation can occur by learning to use the Abnormal Sensory Inputs or learning to rely more on other intact sensory inputs (Vision, Touch etc.)
- McGurk Effect - Lip Reading can change what words you hear when a person is speaking

### Tinnitus

- Perception of a phantom sound without a corresponding acoustic stimulus (often associated with Adaptation to Hearing Loss)
- This can be tone-like (beep or whistle) or noise-like (Hissing/roaring)
- It can be perceived in one ear, both eyes or within the head

| Objective Tinnitis | Subjective Tinnitis |
| --- | --- |
| Produced by a Physical Source within the Body E.g Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions, Blood Vessel anomalies in the Vicinity of the Cochlea (Pulsatile Tinnitus) | No physical generator for the acoustic sensation |
| Can sometimes be heard by other people | Can only be heard by the Px |
| 5% of Tinnitis Cases | 95% of Tinnitis Cases |

### Pinna Based Spacial Cues

- In principle, people can also locate sounds using a single ear.
- This is because the pinna filters sound (changes its spectrum) in a direction dependent way.
- So the spectrum of a sound in one ear provides information about the location of that sound.
- However, in practice, each person’s pinnae are unique to them, which means that people must learn how to use their own pinnae to locate sound.
- Without the pinna-based spectral cues, it would be impossible to tell if sounds are above or below you (Interaural Level Differences and Interaural Time Differences don’t change with elevation).
- It would also be impossible to tell whether sounds are in front of you or behind you (Interaural Time Differences and Interaural Level Differences only depend on distance from the midline. So, for example, if a sound is either directly in front of you or directly behind you, it will be equally loud in the two ears and arrive at the two ears at the same time).
