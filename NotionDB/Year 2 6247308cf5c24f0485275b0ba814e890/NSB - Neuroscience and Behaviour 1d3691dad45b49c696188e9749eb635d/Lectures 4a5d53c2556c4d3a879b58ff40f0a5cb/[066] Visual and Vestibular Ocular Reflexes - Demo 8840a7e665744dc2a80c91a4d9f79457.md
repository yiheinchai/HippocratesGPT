# [066] Visual and Vestibular Ocular Reflexes - Demonstrations

# Optokinetic Reflex

- When an individual is moving whilst the Visual Field is stationary, there is visual flow (the visual word seems to move)
- Fixation on a point of interest can be maintained by individuals slowly moving their eyes in the opposite direction of motion (Tracking) - This is possible due to the Optokinetic Reflex
- When the eyes begin to reach the limits of their Lateral Movement or the Point of Interest is about to leave the Visual Field, there will be a rapid eye movement (Saccade) in the direction of movement to allow for fixation on a new point
- Therefore, the Optokinetic Reflex (Allowing Fixation on a Stationary Point when moving) is characterised by a slow tracking movement in the direction opposite to that of motion to maintain fixation, followed by a rapid saccade in the direction of movement to establish a new fixation point
- Nystagmus = Oscillations of eye movements (can be indications of damage/disease)
- Alternating slow and fast phase eye movements when moving through a Visual Scene due to the Optokinetic Reflex is normal and is known as Optokinetic Nystagmus

# Stabilising Gaze during Head Movement

- When moving our head, fixation (Gaze stabilised on a point of interest) is kept stable via the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex
- The Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex and Optokinetic Reflex work together to maintain fixation with Moving Points of Interest (OKR) and when moving the head (VOR), meaning that the OKR is active to maintain fixation when the visual field is moving and the VOR is active to maintain fixation when the head is moving

# Barany Chair and Electrooculogram

### Barany Chair

- Subject is rotated to the right at a constant rate (usually 180 revolutions/minute)
- There is Vestibular Drive as rotation of the subject establishes Angular Acceleration which activates the Vestibular System
- There is also Optokinetic Drive as whilst the subject is rotating, the Visual World is remaining stationary, producing Visual Flow

### Electrooculogram/EOG

- There is a standing potential from the front of the cornea to the back of the eye, with the cornea being positive and the back of the eye being negative due to the generation of APs within the Retina.
- This measure voltage is the electrooculogram – EOG.
- Electrodes placed at the Lateral canthus of the two eyes measure voltage differences in response to horizontal eye
movements.
- Grounding electrode is placed on the Forehead
- When the subjects looks to their right/left, the ipsilateral electrode will become positive as the front of the Eye (which is positive) moves towards this electrode with respect to the contralateral electrode (which becomes more negative as the back of the Contralateral eye/retina moves closer towards the contralateral electrode).
- Electrodes above and below the eyes can measure vertical eye movements.
- Callibration is done by asking the Px to look towards one side and seeing the polarity of the Signal seen on the EOG and then looking to the other side and seeing the opposite polarity (Usually, Upwards Deflection = Looking to the Right)

# Rotation in the Light - Eyes Open

- When a subject is rotated to the right in a Barany Chair, Horizontal Eye Movements occur, with a slow phase and a fast phase repeating over and over (Indicated by Peaks and Troughs on the EOG) as the Subject is fixating on a point in the Visual World (which is moving) and then fixating on a new point when the Original Fixation Point leaves the Visual Field
- During the Slow Phase, the Subject tracks objects in the Visual Field
- During the Fast Phase, there is a Saccade where the eye rapidly moves back to a new position to re-establish a new point of focus
- This means that within the Optokinetic Nystagmus, the eye movements in opposite direction to that of Rotation characterise the Slow Phase whereas Eye Movements in the same direction as rotation characterise the Rapid Phase (Saccade)
- Optokinetic Nystagmus is seen for the entirety of the Rotation

# Rotation in the Dark - Blindfolded

- When a subject is rotated in the dark/eyes closed, there is no visual world upon which a fixation point can be established, meaning no Optokinetic Response is possible so all Nystagmus produced is Vestibuloocular in Origin
- When a subject is rotated in the dark, there is initially a slow phase and a fast phase of Horizontal Eye Movements that is repeated (Same Nystagmus Pattern as seen when the Px is rotated with their eyes open)
- The Amplitude of the Nystagmus when the eyes were closer was smaller than that of when the Eyes were open as when the eyes are open, the Nystagmus is driven via the Optokinetic and Vestibuloocular Reflexes whereas when the eyes are closed, the Nystagmus is only driven by the Vestibuloocular Reflex
- However, over time, the Horizontal Eye Movements that characterise the Nystagmus get weaker (Habituates as the Endolymph begins to move at the same velocity as the Semicircular Canals, causing no Endolymph Acceleration and hence, reducing Vestibular Drive) so that as rotation duration increases, Nystagmus diminishes and eventually, disappears
- This is not seen for the Optokinetic Nystagmus previously therefore, the Vestibuloocular Reflex Habituates whereas the Optokinetic Reflex does not
- When Rotation stops and the subject attempts to fixate on a point in the Visual World, there is Post-Rotatory Nystagmus following the Same Pattern as that seen during the Rotatory Phase initially but in the opposite direction (Slow Tracking Movement in the direction of rotation and the Fast Saccade in the direction opposite to movement - Feels as though Px is being rotated in the opposite direction)
- Post-Rotatory Nystagmus is due to the Continued Movement of the Endolymph within the Semicircular Canal (which is now stationary) due to its momentum, occurring until the Endolymph slows down again to reduce Vestibular Drive and hence, the Nystagmus
- When the Eyes are open and the Visual Field is present, The Visual Field remains stable despite continued Endolymph Movement, with the observation of the Stationary Visual Field suppressing the Post-Rotatory Nystagmus.

# Rotation for 48s with Eyes Open

- When a subject is rotated for 48s with their eyes open, Nystagmus continues for the whole 48s of rotation.
- When rotation stops – Nystagmus is quickly suppressed.
- If eyes closed after rotation has ended, post-rotatory nystagmus sets in – with
opposite direction of slow and fast phases.
- If eyes opened again, post-rotatory nystagmus is suppressed again.

# Rotation for 48s with Eyes Blindfolded

- After about 20s of rotation nystagmus begins to be suppressed.
- When rotation stops, a clear post-rotatory nystagmus sets in.
- Its direction is opposite to the nystagmus during rotation and it slowly diminishes, also over about 20s.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 00.54.06.png](%5B066%5D%20Visual%20and%20Vestibular%20Ocular%20Reflexes%20-%20Demo%208840a7e665744dc2a80c91a4d9f79457/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_00.54.06.png)

# Rotation with Eyes Closed and then Opened

- After about 20s of rotation with eyes closed, nystagmus begins to be suppressed.
- When eyes are opened, nystagmus returns.
- The Vestibuloocular Reflex (VOR) declines over about 20s of rotation.
- The Optokinetic Response does not decline. When eyes are opened, it is restored.

# Define What is Meant by a Reflex Response

- A reflex response is an involuntary, repeatable response of the
body to a stimulus.

# Describe a Simple Reflex Arc in Terms fo Receptors, Nerve Cells and Effectors

- Receptors, afferent or sensory nerve, possible interneurons, efferent or motor nerve, effectors are components of the reflex arc.

# Compare What Happens to Your Ability To Read 1) While Shaking Your Head from Side to Side 2) Moving the Page From Side to Side

- You could read a page of writing when you shook your head from side to side faster than reading while you moved the
page from side to side. I.e. eye fixation in spite of head movements was more effective than eye fixation when you moved the object on which you were fixating.
- The fast eye movements made to follow a moving object are called saccades.
- They are not necessarily rhythmic and may be in any direction e.g. to watch a
stinging insect darting around.

# Describe your Eye Movements when watching Scenery from the
Window of a Moving Train. How does this Differ from the Eye
Movements in The Question Above

- When you watch scenery on a moving train, your head is still but the object in the visual field is moving.
- The optokinetic reflex is important here. This reflex enables you to track a moving object in the visual field.
- When the element of fixation disappears from the field of view, then there is nystagmus to the opposite direction of the movement so that you can fixate on another aspect of the moving object.
- Suppose you were facing forward in the train and looking out of the window on your left.
- You would fixate on an object e.g. a tree and your eyes would move to the left until it became uncomfortable, when the eyes would flick to the right to fixate on
a new object.
- This pursuit and flick would be repeated involuntarily and rhythmically as the scene moved past your gaze.
- The repeated eye movements of slow drift in one direction and fast flick in the other direction are called nystagmus. The direction of nystagmus (e.g. nystagmus to the right) is labelled by the
direction of the fast flick

# Explain the Difference between Optokinetic and Vestibular Control of Eye Position. Why do You need both Mechanisms?

- The optokinetic reflex allows us to track a moving object in the visual field when the head is still.
- It is a combination of smooth eye movement and saccadic eye movement – they move smoothly to track the object, and there is a saccadic movement in the opposite direction to reacquire the target.
- Vestibular control of eye position occurs when you move your head. It adjusts the position of your eyes so that despite the head movement, the object you are focusing on remains in the centre
of your visual field.

---

# Define Nystagmus and Saccadic Eye Movements

- Nystagmus: involuntary eye movement. This can be physiological (could be vestibular driven or optokinetic) or pathological.
- Saccadic: rapid, jerky movement of eye, from 1 focus to another. Voluntary or involuntary.

# Appreciate the use of the Baranyi Chair for the Controlled study of Vestibulo-Ocular reflexes. Explain how the effects of Optokinetic and Vestibular reflexes on Eye Movements can be Separated.

- When the eyes are open, the nystagmus is caused by both the vestibulo-ocular reflex and optokinetic reflex.
- To separate the reflexes, we need to blindfold the patient. By doing this, they don’t fixate on a moving object, and the optokinetic reflex is taken out.
- Movements of the eyes could be recorded as electric potentials while the subject was rotated at constant velocity in the Baranyi
chair.
- The subject was rotated for 30 s with eyes open, so that both optokinetic and vestibulo-ocular reflexes could operate. Then the subject was rotated with a blindfold, so that the optokinetic
component was removed.

---

# Describe the Use of the Electrooculography (EOG) for Measuring Eye Movements

- The EOG measures the potential difference created by eye movements.
- Eye movements to one side will move one direction, and eye movements to the opposite side will cause the reverse of
that.
- The potential difference is measured against time.
- Electrodes placed just lateral to eyes. Voltage difference between front of cornea and back of retain is measured.
- Front of eye is +ve, and back -ve (Prof. Yeo thinks it’s this way round).

---

# Describe Adaptation of the Reflex Response with Prolonged Stimulation. Do all Reflexes show Adaptation?

- The VOR stops after 30 seconds of spinning.
- This is because the endolymph is moving at the same speed as the head is rotating, and so the forces on the fluid are ↓, and there is no activation of
the vestibular system.

---

# Describe the Effect on the Post-Rotational Nystagmus of the Eyes being Opened or Closed

- When the eyes are closed, the post rotatory nystagmus lasts a lot longer.
- This is because the eyes can’t fix onto an object in the visual field, and so the reflex is not suppressed.
- With the eyes open during rotation there was nystagmus to the right (fast flick to the right), and little or no adaptation.
- After rotation there might have been a very brief period of nystagmus to the left, but the eyes fixate on stationary objects in the room pretty rapidly.
- In contrast, with the eyes closed during rotation, there was nystagmus to the right that habituated after about 20
secs, and disappeared by 30 sec.
- Usually after rotation stops, there is marked post-rotational nystagmus to the left for 10 to 20 sec when the eyes remain blindfolded.
