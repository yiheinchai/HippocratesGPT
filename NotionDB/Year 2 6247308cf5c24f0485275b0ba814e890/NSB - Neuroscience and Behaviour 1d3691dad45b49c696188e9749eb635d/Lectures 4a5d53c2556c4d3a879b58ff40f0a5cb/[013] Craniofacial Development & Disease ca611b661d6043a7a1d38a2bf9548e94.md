# The Head and Skull

- The Head has 4 main Functions:
1. Food and drink Intake
2. Brain capsule (protein)
3. Gas exchange (mediates airflow into the respiratory tract)
4. Houses external sensory organs (eyes, tongue, ears etc.)

- The Skull protects the brain and sensory organs (eyes etc.) and comprised of 3 main components
1. Neurocranium (skull vault) - This is the Superior Part of the Skull
- This is comprised of the Desmocranium (membranous) and Chondrocranium (cartilaginous)
1. Viscerocranium (face) - This is the Anteroinferior part of the Skull
2. Chondrocranium (cranial base) - This is the Posteroinferior Part of the Skull

# Viscerocranium

- During Early Development (Day 24/Week 3), the Frontonasal Prominence can be seen on the Rostral end of the Embryo
- This is an unpaired rostral swelling of the embryo that forms the forehead and the tip and bridge of the nose and extends superiorly
- The Face is formed predominantly by the Frontonasal Prominence and the 1st Pharyngeal Arch
- The 1st Pharyngeal Arch splits into Ventral and Dorsal Segments:
1. The Dorsal Segment is the Maxillary Process and forms the Upper Jaw
2. The Ventral Segment is the Mandibular Process and forms the Lower Jaw
- By Week 7, the 1st Pharyngeal Arches have migrated medially and fused in the Midline to begin to form the Mouth, with holes forming either side of the Frontonasal Prominence (these form the Nostrils) and the Eyes beginning to form
- By Week 10, the entire Embryonic Head has fused and formed

# Pharyngeal/Branchial Arches

- Pharyngeal Arches are paired/bilateral outpoucings of the Ventral Body Wall that arise either side of the Midline in the Rostral Aspect of the Embryo
- These are present during Weeks 4-8
- These Pharyngeal Arches arise sequentially, initially forming most rostrally (1st Pharyngeal Arch) and arise moving caudally until there are 5 Pharyngeal Arches
- These are named Pharyngeal Arch 1,2,3,4 and 6 (This is as the 5th Pharyngeal Arch only exists for a very short amount of time before it regresses)
- They are comprised of all 3 Germ Layers and the Neural Crest Cells (Often Considered to be the 4th Germ Layer)
- They have an Ectoderm Superficial layer and an Endoderm Deep Layer (In contact with the Central Body Cavity)
- Inside each Pharyngeal Arch, there is a superficial Layer of NCCs and a Deep Layer of Mesoderm, with Arch arteries found embedded within the Mesoderm

# The Face

### External Surface of the Face

- The face is formed from Mesoderm/Neural Crest-Derived Mesenchyme during Weeks 5-7 via cycles of Proliferation, Migration and Facial Structure
- During Week 5, there is a midline sagittal groove that divides the Frontonasal Prominence into two Halves whilst the Mandibular Processes have fused
- During Week 5, the Frontonasal Prominence begins to fuse with the Superior Surface of the 1st Pharyngeal Arches (Found inferiorly) which has split into its Mandibular and Maxillary Processes
- After this occurs, the Developing Facial Bones widen (are stretched laterally) whilst Nasal Pits form in the Inferolateral Aspects of the Frontonasal Prominence, surrounded by Medial and Lateral Nasal Processes (With the Lateral Process being Attached to the Superomedial Surface of the Maxillary Process)
- These Nasal Processes then migrate inferomedially with the Nasal Pit, with the Medial Processes fusing at the Midline to form the Nasal Bridge whilst the Lateral Processes form the Nasal Alae (Lateral Projections of the Nose from the Midline Bridge)
- The Inferomedial Migration of the Nasal Structures drags the Maxillary Process medially with the Nasal Structures, with these Maxillary Processes fusing in the Midline to complete the formation of the Face
- Whilst the Maxillary Processes migrate medially, this displaces the Mandibular Process so it becomes concave anteriorly (instead of convex) like the adult mandible so that the Apex of the Process projects inferiorly vs superiorly
- The fusion of these 2 Structures occurs during Weeks 5-7, where it is complete by Week 7
- If there is improper/lack of fusion of the 1st Pharyngeal Arch and the Frontonasal Prominence by the end of Week 7, these structures will never fuse after this and congenital defects will arise

### Internal Surface of the Face

- This is an inferior view of the Face, looking Superiorly
- During Week 7, the Palatal Shelves can be seen either side of the Developing Oral Cavity
- These Palatal Shelves grows inferomedially (lateral to the Developing Tongue), then elevate so that they project medially above the tongue and then fuse (by further growing medially)
- Fusion of the Palatal Shelves to form the Hard Palate initially occurs in the Middle of the Palatal Shelves, with this fusion moving both Ventrally and Dorsally (Similar to Neural Tube Closure)

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 19.59.40.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_19.59.40.png)

# Neurocranium

- This protects the Brain and is mainly formed by flat bones, formed via Intramembranous Ossification
- The Flat Bones of the Neurocranium are derived from Mesenchyme that is formed from Mesoderm (Posterior Neurocranium) and Neural Crest (Anterior Neurocranium)
- The Bones of the Neurocranium are joined by Mesenchymal Sutures (Present In Utero and Newborn mainly but some persist until Adulhood) which provide flexibility to the skull to allow for the Cranial Cavity to expand to accommodate the Rapid development of the Brain during early life without any increases in ICP

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 20.09.25.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_20.09.25.png)

# Craniofacial Sutures

- The fetal cranial vault is made of membrane bones separated by soft fibrous sutures that allows the cranium to deform during birth and to expand during childhood as the brain grows (alongside fontanelles).
- Large membrane covered fontanelles are found where several bones meet.

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 20.10.00.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_20.10.00.png)

---

# Coronal Suture

- This separates the Frontal and Parietal bones which are formed by mesoderm and neural crest-derived
mesenchyme respectively
- This is an example of an Overlapping Suture, where the Frontal Bone extends anteriorly underneath the Parietal Bone, with these 2 bones separated by an Oblique/Anteroinferior Suture
- There are 3 Types of Suture in the Skull:
1. Overlapping - Where one bone overlaps and grows over another bone
2. Interdigitating - This is where two bones are joined together end-to-end, with bony projections of each bone extending into the Bone opposite it to produce a wavy/jagged suture
3. Opposing - Where two bones are joined together end-to-end with smooth margins (no interdigitating of Bone) to produce a straight line suture

# Suture Development

- Engrailed-1 is a Transcription Factor and Gene Regulator that induces the expression of FGFR2 within the Osteoblast-Precursor Cells of the Frontal and Parietal Bone
- FGFR2 acts on the Mesenchyme of the Frontal Bone (Neural Crest Cell Derived) and Parietal Bone (Mesoderm Derived) causing them to differentiate into Osteoblasts that synthesise the Respective Bones (Osteogenic Differentiation)
- Between these 2 Populations of Mesenchyme that form the Skull Bones, Sutural Cells (A Mix of Neural Crest Cell and Mesoderm Derived Cells) are found
- For these Cells, Engrailed-1 inhibits the activity of FGFR2 (as it is a different isoform to that expressed in the Bone Mesenchyme) within these bones, which inhibits Osteogenic Differentiation
- This enables it to remain as mesenchyme and prevent it from forming bone, causing Suture formation

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 20.18.32.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_20.18.32.png)

# Cleft Lip and Palate

- Collectively 1/700 babies are born with cleft of lip or palate (~1000/yr in UK; 500/day worldwide).
- Cleft Lips and Palates are usually divided into 2 Groups:
1. Cleft lip Â± cleft palate (CLP)
- It varies significantly in incidence between 1/300- 3000 births but also varies significantly geographically
- This is more common in males
- Only 30% are syndromic
1. Cleft (Hard) palate only (CPO) is seen in 1/1500 births (More Common than CLP)
- This is more common in females
- Around 50% are syndromic, with known genetic causes

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 20.30.42.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_20.30.42.png)

---

# X-Linked Cleft Palate (CPX)

- This is one of the most frequent syndromic forms of Cleft Palate, forming 5% of all CP
1. CPX
- submucous (~50%)
- bifid uvula (~30%)
- overt (~20%)
1. Ankyloglossia (tongue-tie where the Lingual Frenulum extends more anteriorly towards the Tip of the Tongue)
- This shows Partial Penetrance (where some individuals with the causative mutation do not develop the trait)

---

# TBX22

- X-Linked Cleft Palate has been linked to Loss of Function mutations in TBX22 (Missense - Replacement of one AA with another or Nonsense/Frameshift)
- Tbx22 is usually expressed at the Posteromedial Edge of the Palatal Shelves (Hard Palate) before they have fused, just lateral to the Tongue
- Tbx22 is also expressed highly in the base of the Tongue
- Where mutations to Tbx22 can lead to a lack of fusion of the Palatal Shelves, this can lead to situations where air is swallowed and liquid is aspirated initially into the Nasal Cavity (as there is no separation between the Nasal and Oral Cavities) and then down into the Lungs
- This can be seen by signs of Air in the Stomach and Water in the Lungs initially

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 20.37.15.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_20.37.15.png)

---

# Submucous Cleft Palate

- Submucous Clefts occur where the Palatine Shelves fail to fuse but the Mucosa that forms the Roof of the Hard Palate does fuse
- This can be difficult to Dx but is usually seen by an Indentation/High Arching of the Hard Palate
- Tbx22 knockouts in Mice have produced Submucosal Cleft Palates as it causes Hypoplastic Palatal Shelves to form (Reduced Growth of the Shelves), meaning the Shelves are too short to fuse whilst the Mucosa that roofs the Palate is unaffected and fuses normally
- In adults with X-Linked Cleft Palates, their Vomer (Found at the Posterior Aspect of the Nasal Septum and Hard Palate) and the Palatine Bones are much smaller whilst surrounding bones are normal sized

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 20.54.36.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_20.54.36.png)

# TBX22 in Palatal Osteogenesis

- Alkaline Phosphatase can be used as a marker for the presence and number of Osteoblasts as it is an enzyme secreted by them (due to its role in Mineralisation of Osteoid)
- In TBX22 Knockout, there is reduced Alkaline Phosphatase expression within the Palatine Bones and Vomer, causing Reduced Bone Growth here (where Tbx22 is expressed - Other bones do not express TBX22 and so are not affected by the Knockout)
- There is reduced Alkaline Phosphatase expression as developing Osteoblasts are arrested at the Osteoprogenitor Stage and are unable to express Runx2, preventing them from differentiating into Mature Osteoblasts
- This only affects the Mesodermal Cells within the Hard Palate, not the Neural Crest Cells

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 20.54.22.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_20.54.22.png)

# Cleft Lip and Palate Treatment

- This Affects feeding, speech, hearing, dentition and psychological development
- Clinical care of these conditions requires a specialist team:
- Surgeon
- Cleft nurse
- Orthodontist
- Paediatrician
- Speech and language therapist
- Psychologist
- Clinical Geneticist
- Palate repair is usually carried out in first year of life
- Additional surgical procedures are likely to be required to improve dentistry and iatrogenic induced facial dysmorphism, particularly if the Cleft Lip/Palate is syndromic.

### Current Research

- Surgical repair often not satisfactory
- This is notably seen in Syndromic, genetic cases as the underlying muscle/bone is likely to be abnormal and hence are unable to repair themselves to completely fix the Cleft Palate/Lip
- This can be theoretically treated by replace bone by stem cell
grafting, using Mesenchymal stem cells (Easy to Culture and Easily differentiate into Bone as they can be Bone Progenitors/Part of the Differentiation Pathway for Bone), Amniotic fluid/Umbilical cord Stem Cells (Rarely used), Induced pluripotent stem cells from Fibroblasts
(iPSC - Commonly used stem cells)
- Using Stem Cells involves In vitro (outside of the body) differentiation to of these stem cells into osteoprogenitors
- These Osteoprogenitors can then be Introduced during corrective surgery and assist with the normal repair of the muscle and bone in attempts to establish a satisfactory repair

# Non-Syndromic Craniosynostosis

- This is caused by premature fusion of cranial sutures
- It has an incidence 1:2,000, with most of the majority of cases being non-syndromic
- no genetic link/associations are currently known, with current theories suggesting it is caused by abnormalities in the in utero environment
- The most affected suture is the sagittal suture that runs down the Midline of the Superior Aspect of the Skull between the Two Parietal Bone
- Non-Syndromic Craniosynostosis tends to only affect a single suture
- Craniosynostosis reduces the flexibility and mouldability of the Skull, causing it to be deformed as the Brain enlarges
- When the Sagittal Suture is affected, the Skull is elongated anteriorly and posteriorly at the fontanelle as it cannot expand superiorly (due to the fusion of the Sagittal Suture), only anteriorly and posteriorly
- It can be corrected effectively by reopening the fused suture during a single surgery

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 23.02.10.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_23.02.10.png)

---

# Syndromic Craniosynostosis

- 30% of Cases of Craniosynostosis are part of a syndrome (which often affect the limbs as well)
- Syndromic Craniosynostosis is usually associated with genetic mutations, notably missense mutations of FGF Receptors or Genes that regulate FGF Signalling (Make up 20% of Cases of Syndromic Craniosynostosis)
- These syndromes are predominantly autosomal dominant such as Crouzon, Apert, Pfeiffe etc.
- This usually involves premature fusion of the Coronal suture and others
- Syndromic Craniosynostosis is usually very difficult to correct entirely, with individuals often having facial/cranial deformations after corrective surgery as many suture are affected, causing very pronounced deformities of the Bones surrounding the non-fused sutures

---

# Clinical Intervention - Surgery

- Surgical correction for craniofacial
dysostosis (Syndromic Craniosynostosis) is usually always required in the 1st Year of Life in order to prevent complications that arise due to the premature suture formation
- These include:
- airway obstruction
- raised intracranial pressure
- These are both acute problems that need to be resolved quickly
- proptosis (as the orbit is small as its growth is restricted by the suture fusion)
- nutrition (can limit feeding)
- appearance
- Around 40% of Cases of Syndromic Craniosynostosis require repeat surgery
- These repeat surgeries often involve the Surgical creation of artificial gaps between the Cranial Bones that act like sutures to provide the skull with the flexibility that allow it to grow and expand alongside the Brain.
- However, as these Cranial Bones enlarge, these gaps eventually shrink and disappear as the Adjacent bones fuse. This means that the surgery often has to be repeated many times (up to 5 times) until the Brain matures stops growing to prevent deformation of the skull
- Many Craniofacial Dysostosis are often associated with Midfacial Hypoplasia, where the Face is shortened
- This is often due to the Premature Fusion of the Coronal Sutures restricting the growth of the Viscerocranium but also due to restricted growth in the Skull Base due to the fusion of sutures here
- This can be corrected by attaching a frame to the skull base, which can be slowly extended to elongate the face back to normal lengths (This also has to be repeated until around the age of 18 when the Brain matures and stops growing to prevent deformation of the Skull)

---

# FGFR2 Mutations and Crouzon Mouse Model

- Many of the Craniofacial Dysostoses that cause Craniosynostosis are caused by mutations to different AAs encoded by the FGFR2 Gene
- These different AA mutations produce slightly different features/traits and hence, are identified as different syndromes, despite these Craniofacial Dysotoses being related to one another
- These Syndromes often present with Coronal Suture Craniosynostosis, Midfacial Hypoplasia and Limb Abnormalities
- The Most Common Mutation in Crouzon is C342Y (A Gain of Function mutation to FGFR2) and leads to the classical signs of Syndromic Craniosynostosis (Coronal Craniosynostosis and Midfacial Hypoplasia)

---

# FGFR2á¶Â³â´Â²Ê¸ Phenotyping

- In Embryos with Crouzon Syndrome, There is less bone in the Cranial Base than normal, which contributes to the Midfacial Hypoplasia seen, where bones which contribute to the Midface do not grow significantly

---

# Cranial, Intramembranous Bones

- Normally, there are no Osteoblast (Indicated by the Expression of Alkaline Phosphotase and Runx2) in the Coronal Suture but there are OBs present in the Frontal Bone and Parietal Bone on either side
- In Syndromic Craniosynostoses, the FGFR2 Mutation causes widespread Osteoblast Activity across the Superior Aspect of the Skull (including where the Suture should be)
- This is because Increased FGFR2 drives Osteoblast differentiation of Mesenchyme, causing the Mesenchyme of the Suture to form Osteoblasts and Bone here instead of Mesenchyme/Connective Tissue, leading to Premature Fusion of the Coronal Suture/Synostosis formation
- This is indicated by Runx2 expression in the Suture, where Runx2 is not usually expressed as FGFR2 induced Runx2 expression by driving Osteoblast Differentiation

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 23.31.51.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_23.31.51.png)

- The FGFR2 Gain of Function Mutation also caused Abnormal Cartilage development within the axial skeleton, notably within the Spinal Cord (Intervertebral Discs) and the Ribs (Here, Abnormal Costal Cartilages caused the ribs to become misaligned)
- In the Trachea, the FGFR2 Gain of Function Mutation can cause some rings of Tracheal Cartilage to fuse together, with more rings fusing together as the severity of the mutation increases
- In the most severe cases, all of the Tracheal Cartilage ring fuse to form a continuous cartilaginous sheath that prevents the Windpipe from Flexing/Bending as the Individual moves their head and neck, causing breathing problems (notably sleep apnoea)

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 23.40.56.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_23.40.56.png)

---

# Tracheal Cartilage

- Sox9 is the gene responsible for Chondrocyte Differentiation and hence, cartilage formation
- In FGFR2 Gain of Function Mutations, there is over expression of Sox9, causing excessive Chondrocyte and hence, Cartilage formation, leading to the fusion of the Tracheal Rings (This gets rid of the Epithelial-Mesenchyme Gap that is seen between the Tracheal Cartilage rings)
- There is also mesenchymal condensation due to the loss of FGF10 expression in the Mesenchyme and increased SHH expression in the Epithelium
- FGFR2 Expression regulates Bone (Runx2) and Cartilage (Sox) Development in a direct manner

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 23.41.25.png](%5B013%5D%20Craniofacial%20Development%20&%20Disease%20ca611b661d6043a7a1d38a2bf9548e94/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_23.41.25.png)

# Ongoing Research

- Increased activity of FGFR2 via the C342Y mutation activates negative feedback loop.
- This leads to a reduction in the output of FGF signalling, causing the Gain of Function Mutation to actually act as a Loss of Function Mutation
- Therefore, by increasing the levels of FGF2RC Expression (Often via Transgenic FGFR2C) to increase the level of FGF Signalling back to normal levels to prevent Syndromic Craniosynostosis as the Negative Feedback Loop is unable to decrease FGF Signalling to below normal levels
- By applying external loading onto the Bones surrounding the Suture, this increased loading will be sensed by Sutural Mesenchyme, which become activated to delay the synostosis/fusion/ossification of the Suture (This is an example of Mechanotransduction - When cells respond to mechanical stimuli by converting them into intracellular signals to alter cellular activity)
- In Individuals with Bradycephaly (Shorter but Higher Skull), Mechanical Loading can be used to elongate and depress the Skull to restore normal skull morphology
