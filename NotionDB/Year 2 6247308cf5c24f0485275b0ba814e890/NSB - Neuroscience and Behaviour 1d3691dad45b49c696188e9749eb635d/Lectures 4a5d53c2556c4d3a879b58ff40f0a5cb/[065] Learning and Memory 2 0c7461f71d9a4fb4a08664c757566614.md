# [065] Learning and Memory 2

# Procedural Learning

- To begin to understand neural mechanisms of learning and memory, we need to know more about essential neural circuitry.
- Human Declarative Memory involves representations of complex experiences, distributed across a wide network of neural structures.
- It is difficult to study their underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms.
- Procedural learning is often simpler and is where Subjects learn to make a particular response, often a movement, in response to a stimulus.
- The essential neural circuitry for such learning is much more easily determined in an animal model and then steps can be taken to identify human mechanisms

# Animal Models for the Study of Learning

- In Russia, Pavlov developed classical conditioning.
- Autonomic reflexes (salivation) or skeletal muscle (leg-flexion) reflexes were conditioned to previously neutral stimuli (E.g presentation of food).
- Therefore, through classical stimulation, 2 separate stimuli (Presentation of Food and Ringing of the Bell) became associated with one another so that either stimulus produced the same response
- In America, Thorndike developed ‘puzzle boxes’ that tested cats’ abilities to learn complex escape procedures.
- Skinner later introduced his ‘Skinner box’ that was widely used to study learning in rats.
- Experimental studies reveal there are different types of procedural learning.

# Non-Associative Learning

- Habituation = gradual waning/reduction of the magnitude of a response with repeated presentations of a constant stimulus.
- Sensitisation = Sudden and pronounced enhancement of responses (usually weak responses) to a stimulus after exposure to a highly arousing event/very strong stimulus.
- A large magnitude stimulus after habituation (greater magnitude than that which gave rise to the Habituation) gives a large response, and this breaks habituation via sensitisation.

# Associative Learning

- Classical conditioning = subjects learn predictive value of 1 event (often behaviourally neutral) for another (usually behaviourally significant).
- E.g Ringing of a bell signals food (Pavlov’s experiments).
- Here, 1 stimulus is associated for another so that either stimulus can produce the desired response as the initial trigger of the response has been associated with the conditioned stimulus so that the conditioned stimulus also triggers the response.
- Operant conditioning or instrumental learning = subjects learn that their responses have behaviourally significant outcomes.
- Thorndike’s cats manipulate a catch to escape a cage (specific skill)
- Skinner’s rats press a lever to obtain food.
- This means that appropriate responses are reinforced by behavioural outcomes (usually reward).
- A stimulus becomes associated with a particular response/outcome (reinforcement learning).

# What are Memories Made of?

- Donald Hebb (1949) suggested: “when an axon of cell A is near enough to excite cell B or repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one other cells firing B, is increased”.
- This means that as one neuron stimulates another neuron more frequently/strongly, the second neuron becomes more likely to fire in response to the first neuron due to a Use-Dependent Increase in Neuronal Excitability/Synaptic efficiency
- It is now widely agreed that alterations in synaptic strength are most likely mechanism underlying learning and memory formation.

# Glutamate Receptors at Excitatory Synapses

- Moderate Glutamate release causes activation of AMPA receptors but may not activate NMDA Receptors as at low levels of Synaptic Drive and Rest, there is a Mg²⁺ block of the NMDA Receptor, making it impermeable to Ca²⁺ block.
- NMDA receptors are activated when postsynaptic membrane is depolarised sufficiently (via activation of numerous nearby AMPA Receptors or other Excitatory Receptors), removing the Mg²⁺ block (Mg²⁺ leaves the receptor) to allow entry of Ca²⁺ into postsynaptic cell via NMDA.

# Long Term Potentiation (LTP)

- Long Term Potentiation refers to the increases in synaptic efficiency that occurs with its usage.
- Persistent increases in synaptic strength following high frequency stimulation of a chemical synapse.
- Induced by strong (tetanic) activation of an afferent input sufficient to activate NMDA receptors.
- Alternatively, a weak input can also undergo LTP if it coincides with postsynaptic depolarisation caused by another, strong input.
- In LTP, Ca²⁺ causes:
1. Recruitment of AMPA receptors on postsynaptic membrane.
2. Also causes ↑ in efficiency of current ones.
- Overall, ↑ postsynaptic responses.
- LTP was first demonstrated in hippocampus.
- It has now been seen in neurons from many different brain regions.
- Low level stimulation of Neurons produces low level activation of Neurons but when Synaptic Drive to neurons was significantly increased for a brief period (High Frequency Tetanus), the magnitude of the Response increased drastically, and remained at this level for a sustained period after the Tetanus, even when the stimulus intensity decreased back to the low initial level (Long Term Potentiation)
- Other inputs synapsing on the same neuron that have not been tetanically activated do not induce LTPs, meaning that synaptic changes in the postsynaptic neuron that produce LTPs are localised to regions where the Tetanised input is found (Input Specific)
- The Input-Specificity of LTP generation provides a memory system where the synaptic efficiency and hence, activity of specific neural circuits can be increased without increasing the activity of other neural circuits that contain a common/shared neuron
- A weak input can also undergo LTP if it occurs at the same time as another strong input (which can generate an LTP on its own), with the summation of these 2 inputs allowing both inputs to undergo LTP
- A weak input can also undergo LTP if 2 inputs to the same neuron occur simultaneously, causing these inputs to summate and depolarise the neuron sufficiently, allowing each of the 2 inputs to undergo LTP
- This means that LTP can be associative and is the most common method of LTP seen in the brain (instead of Tetanic Activation of individual inputs).

- Where a strong/tetanic activation of an afferent input is sufficient to activate NMDA Receptors and generate an LTP, this causes increased expression of AMPA Receptors on the Postsynaptic Membrane of the Stimulated Dendritic Spine and Adjacent Dendritic Spines or the growth of additional presynaptic nerve terminals which branch from the original nerve terminal
- Both of these increase the postsynaptic response to the input, increasing the synaptic efficiency, which is responsible for the LTP

# Associative Learning Through an LTP Mechanism

- A neuron receives inputs relating to **sight** of a rose (A), **smell** of a rose (B) and smell of an onion (C).
- Individually, neither of the inputs is sufficient to depolarise neuron alone.
- A and B (seeing and smelling roses) often occur together/simultaneously, so these two weaker inputs summate to allow for an LTP to occur at both inputs.
- Due to this LTP generation at A or B, A or B can now activate the cell when stimulated but C cannot (as it does not usually occur with seeing/smelling a rose).
- This means that the Neuron can now recognise a rose by sight or smell independently (becomes ‘sensitive/specific’ to roses and its sensory modalities)
- This sort of learning is more likely a property of networks of neurons, rather than individual ones.

# LTP Depends on Postsynaptic Ca²⁺ Levels

- Ca²⁺ enters through NMDA receptor to activate protein kinases.
- These can change/increase the effectiveness of existing AMPA receptors or lead to the insertion of new AMPA receptors via phosphorylation.
- Postsynaptic Ca²⁺ levels are critical for LTP Generation and depends upon the exact level of NMDA receptor activation.
- If Ca²⁺ levels are high, then LTP occurs and if there is no change in Postsynaptic Ca²⁺ (depolarisation is not sufficient to activate NMDA/remove Mg²⁺ block), there is no change to synaptic efficiency/postsynaptic NMDA expression
- At intermediate levels of Ca²⁺ (Higher than baseline but not enough to produce LTP), depression can occur, caused by the internalisation of NMDA-R from the Postsynaptic Membrane.
- This mechanism is normal so that LTP occurs in reverse direction (i.e. ↓ synaptic efficiency of neural networks that are not being used frequently).
- This results in a dynamic and plastic memory system that changes synaptic efficiency within neural networks directly according to level of input (prevents hyperexcitable neural networks).

# Long Term Depression (LTD)

- If an input is stimulated with a low frequency tetanus (not sufficient magnitude to trigger LTP), an input specific LTD can be measured.
- If LTP were only synaptic mechanism available for learning, then neural networks might saturate through a lifetime due to a gradual and continuous increase in synaptic efficiency via LTP.
- Information storage in learning and memory formation is likely to depend upon LTP and LTD processes.
- Low Ca²⁺  levels in postsynaptic nerve causes activation of phosphatases that dephosphorylate AMPA receptors, which causes them to become internalised, ↓ sensitivity of neurone and efficacy of synapse.

# Cerebellar Cortex and Cerebellar Long-Term Depression

### Cerebellar Cortex

- The regular repeating array of neurons within the Cerebellar Cortex indicates the Cerebellar Cortex is a learning system
- Millions of Mossy/Parallel Fibres convey wide varieties of information/sensory modalities about the wider motor ‘context’ (Proprioception, Efference Copy, Cutaneous Somatosensation) to a single Purkinje Cell whilst movements are being carried out
- Climbing Fibres code instruction about whether errors are being executed in movement or not to modify or learn new movements
- Learning by modification of pf-PC (Parallel Fibre-Purkinje Cell) synapses via LTD (to increase disinhibition of Cerebellar Nucleus that influence movement) underpins Motor Learning

![Screenshot 2022-01-09 at 15.07.12.png](%5B065%5D%20Learning%20and%20Memory%202%200c7461f71d9a4fb4a08664c757566614/Screenshot_2022-01-09_at_15.07.12.png)

### Cerebellar Long-Term Depression (LTD)

- Simultaneous activation of climbing fibre and parallel fibre inputs leads to a long-term depression of Parallel fibre synapses upon Purkinje cells, reducing the magnitude of the response produced by Purkinje Cells in response to Parallel Fibres.

# Molecular Mechanisms of Cellular LTD

- Whereas in Hippocampal and Cortical Neurons, High and Intermediate Postsynaptic Ca²⁺ causes LTPs and LTDs respectively, High and Intermediate Postsynaptic Ca²⁺ causes LTDs and LTPs in Purkinje Cells respectively
- No NMDA receptors are expressed on Purkinje cell, but voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels are found here (AMPA and Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors are expressed still).
- When climbing fibre depolarises cell via Na⁺ Influx through AMPA-R, Voltage-Gated Ca²⁺ Channels are activated, allowing Ca²⁺ Influx.
- Parallel fibres activates GPCR Glutamate receptor, activating Gq which produces DAG, which activates PKC (which is Ca²⁺ sensitive)
- If you activate Climbing Fibres and Parallel Fibre simultaneously, This causes High Postsynaptic Ca²⁺ (influxed via Voltage-Gated Ca²⁺ Channels) and PKC activation (via mGluR) respectively
- In presence of Ca²⁺, PKC phosphorylates AMPA receptors and internalises them, leading to reduced postsynaptic AMPA expression, reducing synaptic efficiency of Parallel Fibres via AMPA Stimulation (LTD)

# Classical/Pavlovian Conditioning of an Eye Blink

- Movement of third eyelid, or nictitating membrane (NM), of rabbit can be elicited by an airpuff to cornea.
- This unconditional stimulus (US) always evokes an unconditional response via the Corneal Reflex (UR).
- Initially, a quiet tone conditional stimulus (CS) does not evoke an NM response as it does not inherently trigger the Corneal Reflex.
- After repeated pairing of the CS (tone) with the US (puff of air), these two stimuli become associated with another/paired so that the CS eventually evokes a conditioned response, with the peak of the response coinciding with when the US would have normally occurred when the US and CS were paired.

![Screenshot 2022-01-10 at 00.17.41.png](%5B065%5D%20Learning%20and%20Memory%202%200c7461f71d9a4fb4a08664c757566614/Screenshot_2022-01-10_at_00.17.41.png)

- Basket, Stellate and Golgi Cells are inhibitory interneurons within the Cerebellar Cortex
1. Air puff stimulates CN V1, which projects into Brainstem Premotor Neurons and Motor CN VII Nucleus to produce a blink response (Corneal/Unconditioned Reflex). 
2. CN V1 also gives off minor projections to the Inferior Olive, which projects Climbing Fibres to the Purkinje Cells conveying information about the US (touch information)
3. Auditory/Tone information projects from CN VIII into the Pontine Nuclei, which projects to the Cerebellar Cortex via Mossy Fibres to enter the Granule Cell-Parallel Fibre System
4. Both of these information streams Converge on Purkinje cells in Lobule HVI of the Cerebellum that project to Cerebellar Nuclei to influence blinking movements
5. LTD within Purkinje Cells here produces reduced excitation of Purkinje Cells in response to Parallel Fibres (Conveying Auditory Information), producing disinhibition of the Cerebellar Nuclei, increasing excitatory outflow to the eyelids to produce blinking, resulting in learned behaviour of closing eyelid when tone occurs.
- Cerebellum must have a role in procedural learning because patient HM could do it despite damage to the Medial Temporal Lobe.

# Classical (Pavlovian Conditioning of an Eyeblink)

- In Transgenic Mice, which contained Purkinje Cells that express a PKC Inhibitor (so LTD cannot occur), Eyeblink condition is impaired and CRs are incorrectly timed (too early)
- This shows that the Purkinje cell PKC is essential for normal eyeblink conditioning.
- This suggests that Parallel Fibre LTD could be an important mechanism in cerebellum-dependent procedural learning.

# Conclusions

- Cellular and molecular mechanisms of learning and memory are still to be confirmed.
- But LTP and LTD are likely candidates, at least for some stages of memory formation.
