# [017] The Intracranial Region

# Functions and Bone Elements of the Skull

- The skull provides skeletal support of the head, Protecting the brain and spinal cord (notably the Medulla Oblongata)
- It acts as the framework/attachment site for the muscles involved in:
1. Chewing
2. Swallowing
3. Speaking
4. Facial expression
5. Eye movement
- Cranium = Skull + Mandible + Hyoid Bone
- The Skull is compartmentalised into a Superior Cranial Cavity, with the Ears found in the middle of this compartment and the Orbits anteriorly within the Cranial Cavity
- Cranial Cavity is surrounded by the Cranial Vault Bones laterally and superiorly and by the Cranial Base bones inferiorly
- Inferior to the Cranial Cavity is the nasal cavity and inferior to this, the oral cavity
- Cranial Vault = Frontal Bone (Anteriorly), Parietal (Superior and Superolaterally), Occipital  (Posteriorly), Squamous Temporal (Posteroinferiorly - This is the flattened region of the Temporal Bone) and Sphenoid (anterolaterally) bones

### Bone Elements of the Skull - Neurocranium Bone Elements

- The Neurocranium is the superior portion of the skull that protects the brain and brainstem
- It contains the Cranial Cavity, the Ear Cavity and the Orbit
- The Viscerocranium is the inferior region of the skull which forms the skeletal framework of the face
- Single/Unpaired Bones of the Skull:
1. Ethmoid (Found Anteriorly)
2. Frontal (Found Anteriorly)
3. Sphenoid (Found Posteriorly)
4. Occipital (Found Posteriorly)
- These are most found around the midline of the body, with the paired bones found bilaterally on either side of the midline
- Paired Bones of the Skull - These form the Cranial Vault/Superior Aspect of the Cranium:
1. Parietal
2. Temporal
- The Unpaired Occipital Bone also contributes to the Cranial Vault
- The neurocranium is a single fused bony capsule, comprised of separate bony elements that have fused (mainly found and visible in the base of the Cranium)
- Bones of the Vault contain outer tables of compact bone with inner trabecular bone called the Diploë where erythropoesis occurs in adult life

# Postnatal Ontogeny of the Skull

- The bones that form the skull are flat bones, connected by immobile, fibrous joints (Sutures).
- Sutures are comprised of membranes made of mostly type I collagen fibres
- At birth, the Metopic Suture runs in the Sagittal Plane  separates each half of the Frontal Bone and usually fuses in the second year of life when the Cranial Vault Bones fuse
- At birth, the Bones surrounding the Bregma, Lambda, Asterion and Pterion are not fully formed, leaving diamond shaped gaps which are covered by Fibrous tissue that fuses with the Dura deep to these regions, forming the Fontanelles
- These Fontanelles allow for movement and deformation of the skull during birth and postnatal growth of the skull to accommodate the developing brain
- They are placed where most of the growth in the skull vault occurs – notably the midsagittal line (Anterior Fontanelle - Between the Temporal Bones) and between the temporal and occipital bones (Lateral Fontanelles)
- The Posterior Fontanelle is much smaller than the Anterior Fontanelle
- The Asterion is where the Temporal (Lateral), Occipital (Posterior) and Parietal (Superior) Bones on the Posterolateral Surface of the Skull - This forms the Posterolateral Fontanelle
- The Pterion is where the Frontal (Superoanterior), Parietal (Superior) Temporal (Lateral) and Sphenoid (Inferoanterior) - This forms the Anterolateral Fontanelle
- The Posterior, Anterolateral and Posterolateral Fontanelle close up in the first few months after/within the first year of birth, with all fontanelles being closed by roughly 2.5 Years of Age
- The sutures between individual skull bones persist until both the neurocranium and the viscerocranium have reached their adult morphology around 21 years of age to allow for Skull Growth after the Fontanelles have completely ossified.
- After that, sutures start to ossify and this process is mostly completed by about the 5th decade of life
- The Skull is functionally divided into the Neurocranium and the Viscerocranium due to their different growth patterns
- The Neurocranium follows a neural growth pattern to accompany the growth of the brain (grows rapidly early in life, reaching adult size quite rapidly, before the musculoskeletal system)
- The Neurocranium and Brain itself reaches 50% its final/adult size by the Age of 2, reaching full size at 8-11 Years
- The Viscerocranium shows a Musculoskeletal Growth Pattern, growing continuously from birth and reaching its peak growth rate around 12-18 to allow for the growth of adult teeth and developing airways and mouth
- Initially, the newborn has a Large Neurocranium in comparison to its viscerocranium whereas by adulthood, these are relatively proportional in size
- The differences in durations of growth here ensures that the Viscerocranium grows more than the Neurocranium so that both aspects of the skull reach normal size by adulthood
- Sutures that are associated with the Viscerocranium do not close until around the age of 18 to allow for the growth of the face
- The difference in growth patterns between the Neurocranium and Viscerocranium means that in the neonate, the Orbit and Face (Viscerocranium) are much smaller than the Neurocranium (Skull Vault)

# External Lateral View of the Cranial Bone Elements

- The Sphenoid is found between the frontal bone superoanteriorly and the Squamous Temporal Bone posteriorly
- Coronal Suture - Runs in the Coronal Plane to join the Frontal Bone anteriorly with the 2 Parietal Bones posteriorly
- The Lambdoid Suture starts centrally and runs inferolaterally on both sides towards the Mastoid Process
- It separates the Occipital Bone posteriorly from the 2 Parietal Bones anteriorly
- At the Coronal and Lamboid Sutures is where most growth occurs to allow for the expansion of the Skull
- The Temporal Bone is connected to the Parietal via the Squamotemporal/Squamous Suture (It is curved)
- The Sagittal Suture runs sagittally down the midline of the Cranial Vault to connect the 2 Parietal Bones
- The Pterion is an H shaped region found on the anterolateral aspect of the Neurocranium, just posterior to the orbit and is the region of the Skull where the Sutures of the Skull converge/are connected to one another
- This is where the Frontal Bone superoanteriorly, Parietal Bone superoposteriorly, Sphenoid inferoanteriorly and the Temporal Bone inferoposteriorly are joined
- The convergence of the Sutures at the Pterion allows for this region to be highly mobile (allowing for chewing as chewing muscles are found overlaying this region) and rapid adjustments/remodelling to the size of the various skull bones during Growth
- Whilst the Pterion is highly mobile, it is also one of the thinnest regions of the skull, with its thinness and various mobile sutures here meaning it is vulnerable to damage
- The Sagittal and Coronal Sutures meet on the superoanterior region of the Cranial Vault at the Bregma

# Cranial Base

- Frontal Bones have orbital processes/plates, just lateral to the Crista Galli, that run underneath the Frontal Lobe and support it
- Sphenoid Bone is found Spanning the width of the Middle of the Cranial Base between the Frontal Bone anteriorly and the Temporal Bones posterolaterally
- Here, it supports parts of the Frontal and Temporal Lobes as well as the Pituitary Gland that are found in the Midline
- The Petrous Temporal Bone is a pyramidal segment of the Temporal Bone, found at its base, that runs superomedially towards the Sella Turcica of the Sphenoid. It helps to support the Temporal Lobe
- Just anterior to the Foramen Magnum, the Basilar Part of the Occipital Bone (Clivus) runs anterosuperiorly to join to the Sphenoid
- Just posterolateral to the Foramen Magnum, there are 2 Cup-Shaped Depressions in the Occipital Lobe to support the Cerebellum
- The Parietal Bone is the only bone to not contribute to the Cranial Base

# Bone Morphology of the Intracranial Region

- The floor of the intracranial region is divided into three fossae, the anterior, middle and posterior cranial fossae
- There is a natural incline from anterior to posterior within the Intracranial Region, which produces a discrete step-like configuration of these fossae from anterior to posterior so that the Anterior Fossa is most superior and the Posterior Fossa is most inferior
- The Anterior Cranial Fossa is mainly formed by the Frontal Bone
- The Middle Cranial Fossa is mainly formed by the Sphenoid Bone medially and by the Temporal Bone (Laterally/Inferolaterally) and the Parietal Bone (Superolaterally)
- The Posterior Cranial Fossa is mainly formed by the Occipital Bone
- Shape of intracranial region follows outline of brain that is found in that fossae as the Skull mineralises after the Brain develops
- This means the Anterior Cranial Fossa is shaped like the Frontal Lobe, the Middle Cranial Fossa like the Parietal Lobe and the Posterior Cranial Fossa like the Brain Stem and Occipital Lobe

![figure_2.jpg](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/figure_2.jpg)

### Anterior Cranial Fossa

- This is mainly formed by the two flattened Orbital Processes/plates of the Frontal Bone on each side
- Between the two orbits, the Ethmoid is found.
- The Cribriform Plate foramen are found in the midline of the Anterior Cranial Fossa (in the Intracranial Surface of the Ethmoid Bone) in the Sagittal Plane
- This plate contains tiny perforations for branches of the Olfactory Nerve to run through, from the top of the nose into the Olfactory Bulbs
- In the Midline of the Anterior Cranial Fossa, either side of the Cribriform Plates, the Ethmoid bone has a raised crest that projects superiorly called the Crista Galli

![Scannable Document on 3 Nov 2021 at 4_37_00 pm.png](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/Scannable_Document_on_3_Nov_2021_at_4_37_00_pm.png)

![f008-025-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/f008-025-9780323393041.jpeg)

**Ethmoid Bone**

- The Ethmoid Bone is extremely fragile and fractured. When this occurs, there is often the loss of CSF, Epistaxis or subconjunctival haemorrhage into the Orbit
- The sides of the Ethmoid bone slope inferolaterally to form the Medial wall of the Orbit (anterior Ethmoid) and the Lateral Walls of the Nasal Cavity (Posterior Ethmoid)
- The Perpendicular Plate is a midline septum of the Ethmoid Bone which projects inferiorly
- This lies high in the nasal cavity in the same sagittal plane as the Crista Galli and is continuous with the Midline Cartilage of the Nose inferiorly

![f008-233-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/f008-233-9780323393041.jpeg)

**Sphenoid Bone**

- Posterior to the Frontal and Ethmoid Bones in the Anterior part of the Anterior Cranial Fossa, part of the Sphenoid forms the Posterior Part of the Anterior Cranial Fossa
- It contains a central body, from which wings arise and project laterally (it looks like a bat/butterfly)
- The Sphenoid Has 4 wings, the Lesser wings (Smaller and project anterior to the Greater wings) and the Greater Wings (Much Larger)
- The Lesser Wings arise from the Sphenoid Body more superior than the Greater Wings
- The Lesser Wing forms the Posterior Margin of the Anterior Cranial Fossa whilst the Greater Wing runs laterally to form the Inferior and Lateral Walls of the Middle Cranial Fossa
- The Flattened, Outer region of the Greater Wing of the Sphenoid contributes to the Pterion of the Cranial Vault

### Middle Cranial Fossa

- Contains the most Foramina out of all the Cranial Fossas
- This is formed predominantly by the Body and the Greater Wings of the Sphenoid
- The Central aspect of the body of the Sphenoid projects superiorly, just posterior to the Anterior Cranial Fossa
- Within this raised central portion, there is a depression called the Pituitary Fossa/Sella Turcica, in which the Pituitary Gland is found
- The Sella Turcica has 2 Anterior Clinoid and 2 Posterior Clinoid Processes at each of its corner, with the Anterior processes found anterior to the Posterior processes
- The Superior Orbital Fissure is found posterolaterally and deep to the Optic Canal
- The Superior Orbital Fissure is the triangular shaped oblique opening in the Sphenoid found between the Lesser and Greater Wings of the Sphenoid within the anterior-most aspect of the Middle Cranial Fossa
- It contains the:
1. Optic Canal/Foramina - This is found just medial to the Anterior Clinoid Process, near where it emerges from the Body of the Sphenoid, and passes through the Lesser Wings of the Sphenoid (Superomedial to the Superior Orbital Fissure)
2. Superior Orbital Fissure - This transmits CN V1
3. Foramen Spinosum - This is the most posterolateral foramen of the Greater Wing of the Sphenoid found close to the Lateral Border of the Greater Wing of the Sphenoid (Spine of the Sphenoid) - This transmits the Middle Meningeal Artery, which creates a deep groove in the bone along its course over the floor of the Middle Cranial Fossa and inner aspect of the Inferolateral Wall of the Cranial Vault
- The Foramen Spinosum is much smaller than the Foramen Ovale, which is found just anteromedial to it
- It is primarily a nutrient artery to the bones of the Cranial Vault
- The Foramen Ovale is larger than the Foramen Spinosum
1. Foramen Ovale (Found Anteromedial to the Foramen Spinosum in the Greater Wing of the Sphenoid) - This is an oval-shaped foramen that transmits CN V3
2. Foramen Rotundum (Found Posterolateral to the Optic Canal and Superior Orbital Fissure but anteromedial to the Foramen Ovale within the Greater Wing of the Sphenoid) - This connects the Middle Cranial Fossa to the Cheek - This transmits CN V2
3. Foramen Lacerum (Found Posteromedial to the Foramen Ovale just posterior to the Body of the Sphenoid)
- The Foramen Lacerum is a gap between the Sphenoid Bone Anteriorly and the Temporal Bone Posteriorly but is closed/filled with Fibrocartilage (Gap is only found once soft tissues of the skull are removed)
1. Carotid Canal - This is found between the Foramen Spinosum of the MCF anteriorly and the Jugular Foramen of the PCF Posteriorly
- Optic Canal, Foramen Rotundum and Superior Orbital Fissure are gateways between the Orbit and the Middle Cranial Fossa
- The Posterior region of the Middle Cranial Fossa is formed by the thick and hard Petrous Part of the Temporal Bone, which is pyramidal in shape and runs obliquely across the Middle Cranial Fossa
- The Petrous Part has a posterior margin that forms a bony ridge (Petrous Crest) that projects superiorly that runs obliquely towards the body of the Sphenoid anteriorly and forms the boundary between the Middle and Posterior Cranial Fossa
- The Petrous Temporal Bone supports the organs of hearing and balance

![f008-026-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/f008-026-9780323393041.jpeg)

### Posterior Cranial Fossa

- The Jugular Foramen is found posterior to the Internal Acoustic Meatus, between the Petrous Temporal Bone anteriorly and the Occipital Bone posteriorly.
- It is irregularly shaped
1. Internal Acoustic Meatus - This is the connection between the Posterior Cranial Fossa and the Ear Cavity
2. Jugular Foramen (Found Laterally, posterior to the Internal Acoustic Meatus) - This transmits CN IX, X, XI and the Internal Jugular Vein
3. Stylomastoid Foramen - This is found just posterolateral to the Jugular Foramen, between the Styloid Process posterolaterally and the Mastoid Process anteromedially, both of the Temporal Bone

### Neurovascular Outlets

- The cranial nerves and blood vessels enter and leave the intracranial regions via foramina and fissures in the floor of the Neurocranium

![Screenshot 2021-10-31 at 15.11.02.png](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/Screenshot_2021-10-31_at_15.11.02.png)

# Cranial Nerves

- There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that emerge directly from the brain (2 pairs) and brainstem (10 pairs)
- They are numbered I-XII based on where they emerge from the brain, moving posteriorly
- They mostly relay information to the head and neck region and can be either pure motor, pure sensory (Special Sensory or General Sensory) or mixed (unlike Spinal Nerves which are almost all mixed)
- They can relay general information that is also perceived by Spinal Nerves (E.g Temperature or Pain) alongside special senses (Vision, Balance, Acoustics, Smell, Taste etc.)
- Special Sensory Nerves = CN I, II, VIII and VII+IX+X (For Olfaction, Vision, Hearing and Balance and Taste respectively)
- Cranial Nerves contain both voluntary and autonomic (Parasympathetic only) fibres, allowing them to mediate reflexes as well as voluntary/conscious actions
- Whilst PSNS Fibres for the Head and Neck region arise from Cranial Nerves, SNS Fibres arise from the Sympathetic Trunk
- Mostly components of the peripheral nervous system but the olfactory (I), optic (II) and the trigeminal nerves (V) could be classified as parts of the central nervous system due to their origin (CN I and CN II) from the brain and not the brainstem
- The distribution of the cranial nerves can be complex but this can be understood when tracking the embryonal development of the cranial nerves
- They all have an intra (between where they emerge from the Brain and their associated foramina) and extracranial course (between their associated Foramina and their Target structures).
- Intracranially, they are all associated with the anterior, middle or posterior cranial fossa

# Cranial Nerves and Cranial base Outlets

- Anterior Cranial Fossa is associated with CN I
- Olfactory Tract/Bulb and Nerves (CN I) are associated with and leave the Intracranial Region via the Cribriform Plate of the Anterior Cranial Fossa
- Middle Cranial Fossa is associated with CN II-VI
- Optic Nerve (CN II) leaves via Optic Canal
- Oculomotor, Trochlear, Opthalmic Division of the Trigeminal Nerve and Abducens Nerves (CN III, IV, V1 and VI) leave the Intracranial Region via the Superior Orbital Fissure to enter the Orbit
- Superior Orbital Fissure = Largest Opening in the Middle Cranial Fossa as it transmits the most nerves within the MCF
- The Maxillary Division of the Trigeminal Nerve (CN V2) leaves the Intracranial Region via Foramen Rotundum
- The Mandibular Division of the Trigeminal Nerve (CN V3) leaves the Intercranial Region via the Foramen Ovale
- Posterior Cranial Fossa is associated with CN VII-XII
- There are fewer Foramina than Cranial Nerves that leave via the Posterior Cranial Fossa as multiple CN leave through a single foramina
- The Facial Nerve and Vestibulocochlear Nerves (CN VII and VIII) leave the Intracranial Region via the Internal Acoustic Meatus (Most Anterior Foramen) to travel towards the Ear
- The Glossopharyngeal, Vagus and Accessory Nerve (CN IX-XI) leave the Intracranial Region via the Jugular Foramen
- The Hypoglossal Nerve (CN XII) leaves the Intracranial Region via the Hypoglossal Canal
- The Spinal Accessory Nerve (region of CN XII that arises from Spinal Cord vs Brain Stem) enters the Intracranial Region via the Foramen Magnum where it leaves with the rest of the nerve via the Jugular Foramen

# Vasculature of the Neck and Cranial Region

- Arterial supply to the brain occurs from Deep (Internal Carotid) moving Superficially whereas Venous drainage of the Brain occurs from Deep to Peripheral (Cranial Sinuses) and then Deep again (Internal Jugular Vein)

![Screenshot 2021-11-22 at 23.27.38.png](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/Screenshot_2021-11-22_at_23.27.38.png)

### Arterial

- Main head and neck supply stems directly from the aorta – via carotid arteries (internal and external)
- The Left Common Carotid arises from the Aorta whereas the Right Common Carotid arises from the Brachiocephalic Trunk

![Screenshot 2021-10-31 at 15.29.21.png](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/Screenshot_2021-10-31_at_15.29.21.png)

### Venous

- Cranial/Meningeal sinuses - Main drainage is to the superior vena cava via jugular veins (internal and external but predominantly internal), forming the Brachiocephalic Veins with the Subclavian Veins, eventually fusing to form the Superior Vena Cava

![Screenshot 2021-10-31 at 15.30.10.png](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/Screenshot_2021-10-31_at_15.30.10.png)

- Additional arterial supply and venous drainage is provided via subclavian arteries/veins by the
1. Vertebral arteries
2. Thyrocervial trunk

# Layers of the Scalp

- There are 5 layers that make up the scalp:
1. The skin, with hair follicles and sebaceous glands, firmly attached to...
2. An underlying dense connective tissue layer (this anchors the skin onto the Epicranial Aponeurosis)
3. The epicranial aponeurosis (Galea Aponeurotica) – This is a flat tendon that is attached to the frontalis and occipitalis (Frontooccipitalis) muscles on the front and back of the head, pulled very tight as these muscles are orientated in different directions
- The Frontalis muscle raises the eyebrows/wrinkles the forehead and the Occpitalis muscle keeps the skin over the Posterior Head taunt
- This is the defining layer for gaping or non-gaping injuries as it is very tough
- If a superficial injury does not penetrate the Epicranial Aponeurosis, the remaining deep layers of the skull remain taunt and together due to the Epicranial Aponeurosis, so the wound does not gape (Non-Gaping)
- If a deep injury penetrates the Epicranial Aponeurosis, the tauntness in this layer provided by the Frontalis and Occipitalis Muscles is lost, meaning that the deep scalp layers are no longer held tightly to one another and pulled taunt, causing a Gaping Wound
- In a Gaping Injury, Laceration of the Epicranial Aponeurosis can cause extensive bleeding into the space between the Aponeurosis and the Deep Areolar Tissue, notably accumulating where it is attached to Frontalis and Occipitalis
1. Loose areolar connective tissue, This allows free movement of the scalp, allowing the Skin and Epicranial Aponeurosis to glide freely over this tissue
- This is called the Danger Zone as Emissary veins from the intracranial regions can track infections from the Intercranial Region into the Loose Areolar Connective Tissue but not above the Epicranial Aponeurosis
1. Periosteum of the skull bones, which can be detached quite readily on both sides of the bone
- Remember SCALP:

**S**kin
**C**onnective Tissue
**A**poneurosis
**L**oose Areolar Connective Tissue
**P**eriosteum

- Normally, the Dense Connective Tissue found deep to the Skin forms a barrier against superficial infections and lacerations and it contains neurovascular structures that supply the Scalp

# Meninges - Dura Mater

- The Skull Bones are richly vascularised, with lots of Veins penetrating the bone
- The Dura Mater is the only attachment of the Brain to the Internal Surface of the Neurocranium
- In the Cerebrum, it is found as a tough and collagenous connective tissue membrane comprised of two layers – the periosteal and the meningeal layers of the dura
- The Periosteal layer of the Dura Mater is tightly fused with the intercranial periosteum of the Cranial Bones
- This means it is impossible to separate the Cerebral Dura Mater from the Periosteum of the Skull Bones
- The Meningeal Layer is slightly thinner than the Periosteal Layer
- The Meningeal layer of the Dura Mater is tightly fused with the Periosteal Layer of the Dura Mater in some places and where these layers are not adherent to one another, large Dural/Meningeal Sinuses arise
- Between the two layers of dura are the cranial sinuses (drainage site of venous blood from the brain)
- These sinuses, particularly the superior sagittal sinus, lots of anastomoses between the diploic veins of the cranial bones and the veins draining the scalp.
- Therefore, infections that are tracked from the Scalp to the Sinuses can easily enter the Venous System and spread around the body

# Falx Cerebri and Tentorium Cerebelli

- The Meningeal layer of the dura mater reflects/folds on itself and forms septa which separate the cerebral hemispheres:
1. Falx Cerebri
- This is a sickle-shaped fold anchored at the Crista Galli anteriorly, is attached to the Frontal, Parietal and Occipital Bones moving posteriorly and merging with the Tentorium Cerebelli posteriorly.
- It runs in the sagittal plane to separate the 2 Hemispheres
1. Tentorium Cerebelli
- These are found bilaterally
- These is formed by the Bifurcation of the Falx Cerebri posteriorly
- It runs anteriorly to attach to the pituitary fossa and lies in the transverse plane to form a superficial roof over the Posterior Cranial Fossa
- This runs between the Cerebellum and Occipital Lobe to prevent the Occipital Lobe from pressing down on and compressing the Cerebellum by deflecting this weight to the regions of the Parietal Bones forming the Lateral walls of the Cranial Vault
- From the Petrous Temporal Bone, the Tentorium Cerebelli is continuous with the Petroclinoid Ligament which connects the Apex of the Petrous Temporal Bone laterally to the Posterior Clinoid medially

![Screenshot 2021-11-04 at 10.54.24.png](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/Screenshot_2021-11-04_at_10.54.24.png)

- The anterior edge of the Tentorium Cerebelli runs anteriorly around the lateral border of the Posterior Cranial Fossa and the Petrous Crests, ending at the Anterior Clinoid Processes of the Sphenoid anteriorly
- The anterior free margin of the Tentorium Cerebelli is crescent shaped (Tentorial Notch), forming an opening between the Body of the Sphenoid and the Tentorial Notch posteriorly through which the Brainstem passes

# Arachnoid and Pia Mater and Associated Spaces

- The Arachnoid mater is separated from dura via subdural space (a potential space which usually doesn't exist but can become visible/pronounced in some pathologies E.g Haemorrhage)
- The Arachnoid Mater contains superficial layers of flattened cells, connected via Tight Junctions to form a continuous flat sheet
- This sheet gives the Arachnoid Mater regulates the passage of ions and molecule to and from the Subarachnoid Space
- The cerebral veins drain into the sagittal sinus and have to cross the subdural space to reach the sinus
- The Arachnoid is separated from the pia mater by the subarachnoid space (large actual space that contains the cerebrospinal fluid)
- The arachnoid mater forms arachnoid villi which protrude into the Cranial Dural sinuses, particularly the superior sagittal sinus
- CSF is found within these Arachnoid Villi and these Villi regulate the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid into the venous circulation by allowing CSF to osmose across the Villi from the Subarachnoid Space into the Sinuses
- As you age, the number of Arachnoid Villi that have you have increases
- The arachnoid villi can become visible as arachnoid granulations either on the superior sagittal sinus as Arachnoid Granulations and/or the cranial vault bones as indentations (notably in the elderly where growing Arachnoid Granulations press into the Bones of the Cranial Vault)
- Pia mater = Fine and Delicate highly vascularised membrane that is tightly associated to the Underlying Brain and dips deeply into the Brain Su
- Cerebral blood vessels lie on the superficial surface of it and pierce through it to reach and supply the brain

# Blood Supply to Cranial Bones and Meninges

- Blood supply to the meninges and cranial bones comes from the Anterior, Middle and Posterior Meningeal arteries
- The Anterior Meningeal Artery is a branch of the Internal Carotid Artery
- The Middle and Posterior Meningeal Arteries branch from the Maxillary Artery, which arises from the External Carotid
- The Middle Meningeal Artery is the largest of the Meningeal Arteries and enters the intracranial region via the foramen spinosum to run outside the dura (has an extradural course), deep the Pterion along the inside of the Temporal Bone.
- Its branches pierce the superficial periosteum to supply the cranial vault bones

![Screenshot 2021-10-31 at 15.43.08.png](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/Screenshot_2021-10-31_at_15.43.08.png)

# Arterial and Venous Supply to the Brain

- In the Brain, the Arterial Supply does not match the Venous Supply very well, notably the large veins draining the brain do not follow the large arteries supplying it

![Screenshot 2021-10-31 at 17.59.15.png](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/Screenshot_2021-10-31_at_17.59.15.png)

### Arterial

- Arterial blood supply from cerebral arteries reaches the brain two-ways:
1. Via the vertebral arteries (posteriorly) 
2. The internal carotid arteries (anteriorly)
- The contribution from the internal carotids is substantially larger than that from the vertebral arteries (the ICA supplies a much larger region of the brain than the Vertebral Arteries as they are larger), despite the Vertebral Artery being the main blood supply to the brain for most other mammals
- Humans are unique with the dominance of the ICA over the Vertebral Arteries as Humans have an extremely high Cerebral Metabolic Rate when compared to other mammals, meaning the Human Brain requires additional blood supply from the ICA to maintain this increased metabolic rate and prevent ischaemia
- The internal carotids are more or less direct branches off the aorta (left common carotid) or the brachiocephalic artery (right common carotid)
- The Internal Carotid Artery does not give off any branches in the Neck or Face Region, until it enters the Intracranial Region via the Carotid Canal
- The vertebral arteries are the first branches off the subclavian arteries and reach the Intracranial Region, via the Foramen Magnum after ascending through the Transversaria Foramina of Cervical Vertebrae

![Screenshot 2021-10-31 at 15.46.12.png](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/Screenshot_2021-10-31_at_15.46.12.png)

# Course of the Internal Carotid Artery

1. It enters the Intracranial Region (Anterior Cranial Fossa) via the Carotid Canal in the Petrous Temporal Bone (Found in the Posterior Border of the Middle Cranial Fossa)
2. It then ascends inside the Bony Carotid Canal within the petrous part of the temporal bone, before turning at a right angle to run medially in the Petrous Temporal Bone towards its Apex
3. It then enters the Middle Cranial Fossa near the Sella Turcica/Pituitary Fossa of the Sphenoid
4. Here, it crosses over the foramen lacerum (between the Petrous Temporal Bone posteriorly and the Sphenoid Anteriorly) which is externally closed by fibrocartilage as it runs anteriorly
5. It then turns at a right angle to run superiorly (piercing the Meninges) and enter the Cavernous Sinus (Filled with Venous Blood) in the Subdural Space, lateral to the Sella Turcica of the Sphenoid/medial to the Anterior Clinoid Process, and runs through it
6. It then bends/turns posteriorly and then superiorly just lateral to the Optic Chiasm
7. It then ends near the optic chiasm, giving off the Opthalmic Artery just after it emerges through the Roof of the Cavernous Sinus (which enters the Orbit) before splitting into its end branches, the Anterior and Middle Cerebral Arteries
- The Middle Cerebral Artery enters the Lateral Fissure of the Brain to supply the Internal Cortex initially, continuing on its path to supply most of the Lateral Aspects of the Cerebral Cortex
- The Ophthalmic Artery enters the Orbit via the Optic Foramen, inferolateral to the Optic Nerve
- It supplies the contents of the Orbit and emerges to supply the skin of the Orbit and the Eyebrow
- The Main branch of the Ophthalmic Artery is the Central Branch of the Retina and is the sole blood supply of the retina, which runs with the Optic Nerve to reach the Eye
- The ICA has no branches in the neck

# Connections Between Anterior and Posterior Blood Supply of the Brain

- The Vertebral Arteries (first branches of the Subclavian Artery in the neck) ascend via the Foramen Transversarium of C6 (it doesn't pass through that of C7), up through the Foramina Transversaria of the Superior Cervical Vertebral to lie on the Lateral Mass of the Atlas
- Here, it passes over the Posterior Arch of the Atlas to enter the Foramen Magnum, where it pierces the Dura to enter the Cranial Cavity and run lateral to the Medulla
- Before the Vertebral Arteries form the Basilar Artery, they give off 2 Branches that fuse to form the Anterior Spinal Arteries and then one Posterior Spinal Artery from each Vertebral Artery
- On the Anterior Pons (on an anterior projection of the Occipital Bone), the two vertebral arteries unite anteriorly to form the basilar artery on the steepest aspect of the Cranial Base after passing through the Foramen Magnum
- The Basillar Artery travels anteriorly, giving off Pontine Arteries from its lateral walls to supply the Pons and the Cerebellum, before giving off the 2 Superior Cerebellar Arteries bilaterally and bifurcating to form the 2 Posterior Cerebral Arteries
- The Left and Right Anterior Cerebral Arteries are connected by the Anterior Communicating Artery, connecting up the Right and Left Halves of the Cerebral Arteries/Circle of Willis
- The Middle Cerebellar Artery is the lateral continuation of the ICA after it gives off the Anterior Cerebral Artery and the Ophthalmic Artery more proximally
- The Posterior Communicating Artery arises from the ICA, just before the Anterior Cerebral Artery arises, connecting the Middle and Posterior Cerebral Arteries
- The Anterior and Middle Cerebral Arteries (from the ICA) and the Posterior Cerebral Arteries (from the Vertebral Arteries) are connected via the Posterior Communicating Artery whilst the Left and Right Cerebral Artery networks are connected via the Anterior Communicating Artery
- This forms an arterial Ring (Circle of Willis) around the Brain Stem
- This ensures equalization of blood pressure in the brain to ensure the Left and Right Hemispheres are equally perfused and collateral, equal supply to all parts of the brain if there is an occlusion of cerebral vessels (E.g Shunting blood from RHS to LHS) independent of head position
- The Posterior Cerebral Arteries supply most of the Occipital and Temporal Lobes
- Whilst the Internal Carotid Artery is the major blood supply to the Brain, the Vertebral Arteries is the older blood supply evolutionarily (Other Mammals just have the Vertebral Arteries supply the Brain) but due to the large size of the Human Brain, the Internal Carotid Artery is also required to perfuse the Brain sufficiently to maintain Cerebral Metabolic Rate (Vertebral Arteries cannot sustain this alone)

# Cranial Venous Sinuses

- Fusion of the Periosteal Layer of the Dura Mater with the Intercranial Periosteum is incomplete where the Dura folds deep into the Intercranial Region to form fibrous septa (Falx Cerebri and Tentorium Cerebelli) and Cranial Venous Sinuses
- The cranial sinuses collect the venous blood from the cerebral veins, meninges and cranial bones mainly into the Internal Jugular Vein
- Some of the smaller venous sinuses are continuous with the Vertebral Venous Plexi which run through the Foramen Magnum around the Spinal Cord
- Other Venous Sinuses connect with Extracranial Veins via Emissary Veins, which pass through the skull via Emissary Foramina
- The Diploic Foramina transmit diploic veins from the diploë to inside/outside the Cranial Vault.
- These foramina do not pass all the way through the Vault bones unlike the Emissary Foramina
- These sinuses are found between the Dura and Periosteum except the Inferior Sagittal and the Straight Sinus
- Superior sagittal sinus – This runs posteriorly along the superior border of falx cerebri and enlarges posteriorly
- It usually turns right, at the tentorial boundary on the occipital bone posteriorly (where the Falx Cerebri and Tentorium Cerebelli meet) to form the Right Transverse Sinus
- Here, The Right Transverse Sinus runs anterolaterally within the Tentorium Cerebelli.
- It then snakes around the outer border of the Temporal Bone in the Posterior Cranial Fossa in an S Shaped Curve, running anteroinferiorly towards the Jugular Foramen to become the Right Sigmoid Sinus, which ends at the right jugular foramen in the Posterior Cranial Fossa to drain into the Internal Jugular Vein
- Lesser/Inferior sagittal sinus – This runs posteriorly along the inferior border of falx cerebri
- At the posterior border between the Falx Cerebri and the Tentorial Notch, the Inferior Sagittal Sinus joins the Great Cerebral Vein and runs posteriorly to become the Straight Sinus
- This runs posteriorly across the Tentorium Cerebelli and turns to the left at the Tentorial Boundary to become the Left Transverse Sinus
- When the Left Transverse Sinus reaches the border of the Temporal Bone, it snakes around the outline of the Temporal Bone in the Posterior Cranial Fossa to form the Left Sigmoid Sinus, which drains into the Left Internal Jugular Vein via the Left Jugular Foramen
- Posteriorly, the Superior Sagittal Sinus meets the Straight Sinus and the Left and Right Transverse Sinuses at the Confluence of the Sinuses, to allow for blood from the Superior and Inferior Sagittal Sinuses to drain into either the Left or Right Jugular Vein via small connecting sinuses between the Transverse Sinuses
- However, this exchange of blood doesn't happen commonly so most of the blood from the Superior Sagittal Sinus drains into the Right Jugular Vein and blood from the Inferior Sagittal Sinus drains into the Left Jugular Vein
- Individuals can be left or right dominant regarding the draining of the Cranial Venous Sinuses, based on which Jugular Vein receives more blood and the size of the Transverse Sinuses
- Most individuals have a larger Right Transverse Sinus and hence, are Right Dominant

![f008-044-9780323393041.jpeg](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/f008-044-9780323393041.jpeg)

- The sigmoid sinuses receive blood from other tributaries such as:
1. Sphenoparietal sinuses
2. Middle meningeal vein
3. Superior and inferior petrosal sinuses 
4. Cavernous sinus (Found Lateral to the Sella Turcica) and drains the orbit
5. Basilar venous plexus (found on the Basilar Part of the Occipital Bone) 
- The Superior Petrosal Sinus connects the Cavernous and Sigmoid Sinuses
- The Superior and Inferior Petrosal Sinuses drain the Basilar Venous Plexus into the Sigmoid Sinus
- The Middle Meningeal Vein drains directly into the Cavernous Sinus and hence, drains into the Sigmoid Sinus via the Superior Petrosal Vein
- All blood from the Intracranial Region eventually drains into the Sigmoid Sinus

# Cavernous Sinus and Its Content

- It is found bilaterally in the Medial Aspect of the Middle Cranial Fossa
- Anterior Border = Superior Orbital Fissure, Posterior Border = Petrous Temporal Bone, Medial Border = Body of the Sphenoid, Superior and Lateral Borders = Meningeal Layer of the Dura
- It is found between the Body of the Sphenoid and the Meningeal Layer of the Dura Mater
- It is a blood filled space that also contains highly vascular spongy tissue that contains lots of fibrous tissue
- As the Cavernous Sinus receives blood from the veins of the Orbit and drains with veins below the Cranial base, this allows infection to spread from the Orbit and Upper Jaw into the Intracranial Region.
- This can possibly lead to a Thrombosis within the Cavernous Sinus
- Each Cavernous Sinus is connected across the midline
- It transmits neurovascular structures on their way to the orbit through its volume and in its lateral wall:
- Towards the Superomedial Part of the Cavernous Sinus, the Pituitary Gland/Hypophysis is surrounded by the Cavernous Sinus, into which it secretes hormones

It contains the 

1. Internal carotid artery
2. Occulomotor Nerve (CN III)
3. Trochlear Nerve (CN IV)
4. Trigeminal Nerve (CN V1 and V2)
5. Abducens Nerve (CN VI)
- CN III, IV, V1 and V2 run in the Lateral Wall of the Cavernous Sinus whilst CN VI runs deep within the Sinus
- CN VI runs anteriorly from the Posterior Cranial Fossa, underneath the Petroclinoid Ligament to enter the Cavernous Sinus
- Within the Cavernous Sinus, CN VI runs just inferolaterally to the Internal Carotid Artery (also in the Substance of the Cavernous Sinus)
- Blood is drained from the Cavernous Sinuses via Petrosal Sinuses (run along the Upper and Lower borders of the Petrosal Temporal Bone)
- The Superior Petrosal Sinus drains into the Transverse Sinus posteriorly and the Inferior Petrosal Sinus drains towards the Jugular Foramen to flow into the Sigmoid Sinus and eventually drain into the Internal Carotid Artery
- The Inferior Petrosal Sinus drains the Inner Ear via the Labyrinthine Vein

# Extradural/Epidural, Subdural and Subarachnoid Haemorrhage

- These can compress the underlying brain and hence, cause loss of consciousness
- Extremely raised ICP can force the Medial Temporal Lobe medially across the Tentorial Notch, which can stretch/trap the Oculomotor Nerve
- This can causes loss of PSNS Innervation to the Pupil, causing non-reactive Mydriasis

### Extradural Haemorrhage

- Mostly arterial bleeds due to damage to the Meningeal Arteries (and sometimes Diploic Veins if the bleed is Venous), producing sharp lens-shaped contours on MRI as the Dura is easily separated from the Cranial Bone
- Lens shape is produced by the Dura detaching from the Cranial Bones centrally due to blood filling this space but remaining attached at each end of the Haematoma where Skull Sutures are found
- This is because the Dura is strongly attached to the Cranial Sutures and hence, is difficult to dissect away from the Cranial Bones
- This causes a haemorrhage into the space between Cranial Bones and the Dura, which appears to significantly compress the Brain
- Most common cause is a ruptured middle meningeal artery in the pterion region as the Pterion is weak here and the Middle Meningeal Artery is quite large here

![Scannable Document on 4 Nov 2021 at 12_15_33 pm.png](%5B017%5D%20The%20Intracranial%20Region%204c782ae163784682b3136341b7cd5aa1/Scannable_Document_on_4_Nov_2021_at_12_15_33_pm.png)

### Subdural Haemorrhage

- This is bleeding into the Subdural Space between the Dura and Arachnoid Mater
- Mostly venous bleeds, due to ruptured cerebral veins that run superficially to drain into the Superior Sagittal Sinus
- Often a narrow crescent-shaped, often more extensive than extradural bleeds as there are no strong attachments between the Dura and Arachnoid Mater to localise the Haematoma
- It can be slow or fast bleeding (Acute or Chronic) and causes more diffuse compression of the brain than Epidural Haematomas

### Subarachnoid Haemorrhage

- This is bleeding into the Subarachnoid space, where there is already CSF present
- Often sudden and with quick onset due to a sudden blow to the head, accompanied by tremendous headaches as increasing the amount of fluid in the subarachnoid space stimulates pain receptors in the Meninges, producing a Headache
- Ruptured cerebral blood vessels (arteries and veins) are often the cause (commonly from Berry Aneurysms)
- Appear diffuse and not well defined as they are distributed throughout the entire subarachnoid space (very difficult to image)

### Strokes

- Common in Elderly and Hypertensive individuals
- Classic site is in the Middle Cerebral Artery, leading to Hemiplegia and loss of Speech due to paralysis of Motor Fibres travelling in the Posterior Limb of the Internal Capsule

---

# Cerebrospinal Fluid

- It regulates ICP and suspends the Brain and Spinal Cord to protect it from injury
- Vascular Networks of the Pia Mater invaginate into the Subarachnoid Space as a series of tuffs to form Choroid Plexi
- Around the Brain, often at its base, the Subarachnoid Space is enlarged to form Subarachnoid Cistern
- CSF is absorbed at Arachnoid Villi (small protrusions of the Arachnoid Mater through openings in the Dura which connect to and form the Superior Sagittal Sinus)
- When Venous Pressure > CSF Pressure, CSF cannot flow through the Arachnoid Villi into the Superior Sagittal Sinus as the Arachnoid Villi collapse
- If an injury to the Anterior Cranial Fossa causes the Meninges found near the Cribriform Plate to tear, CSF (possibly blood stained) can leak into the Nasal Cavity (Rhinorrhoea) and if an injury to the Middle Cranial Fossa causes the Petrous Temporal Bone to break, CSF (possibly blood-stained) can leak into the Ear (Otorrhoea)
