# Sound as a Pressure Wave

- Vibrations of objects set up pressure waves in surrounding/adjacent air, causing compressions and rarefactions to arise to produce a longitudinal wave.
- This means that when the air molecules are compressed, Air pressure is high and when the molecules are rarefied, air pressure is low
- Elastic property of air allows these pressure waves to propagate (spread) in space.
- When Air Pressure is plotted against time for a sound pressure wave, this produces a sine wave (pure tone)

# Pure (Sine Waves) and Complex Tones

### Pure Tones (Sine Waves)

- For pure tones, tone frequency is directly related to pitch of sound, and amplitude is related to perceived loudness.
- These relationships are logarithmic. Hence octave and decibel scales:
1. Every doubling of frequency ↑ pitch by 1 octave.
2. Every doubling of amplitude ↑ loudness by 6 dB.

### Complex Tones

- Most natural oscillators do not just emit simple tones of a single frequency. Instead, they contain energy at multiple frequencies.
- For sounds with a clear pitch, these frequency components are harmonically related (i.e. their frequencies are all integer multiples of a fundamental frequency).
- Every sound can be described as a sum of sine waves with different frequencies.

# Fourier Spectra

- Instead of plotting sounds as a function of time, we can describe a sound in terms of its frequency components (i.e. sine waves it contains and hence, how much energy is present at different frequencies).
- Using Fourier analysis, we can plot amplitude/energy (and phase) for each frequency component of a sound → This allows for the identification of the individual pure tones and their amplitude which form the complex tone.
- This is known as sound spectrum. This provides a compact representation for signals that contain oscillations.

# Broad Band and Narrow Band Sounds

### Narrowband Sounds

- This contain energy at a narrow range of
frequencies (identifiable on a Fourier Analysis).
- Pure tone is an extreme of this.
- Narrow band sounds are periodic and may evoke an identifiable pitch.

### Broadband Sounds

- (e.g. static on television signal)
- contain energy at lots of different frequencies (wide frequency range - identifiable on a Fourier Analysis).
- Noises and clicks are typical examples of natural broadband sounds.

# Spectrogram

- Spectrum for a sound of any length is constant.
- However, natural sounds usually change over time.
- To deal with this, sounds can be divided into short time segments, and fourier spectra calculated for each time segment in turn.
- Result of this analyses combined together is called a spectrogram and shows energy distribution along different frequencies against time (indicated by colour intensity).
- The ear is able to function in a similar manner, converting information on Air Pressure as a function of time and is converting it into a spectrum that provides information on the frequency and amplitude of specific pure tones at a specific moment in time in order to produce a sound of the correct pitch and loudness at the right time

# Overview of Peripheral Auditory System

- Sound is Filtered by the Outer Ear, Amplified by the Middle Ear and processed by the Inner Ear to produce Auditory Information that is sent to A1

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 17.47.04.png](%5B053%5D%20Peripheral%20and%20Central%20Auditory%20Processing%201%20305d5e48831e4209916e8d7db9f29ae6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_17.47.04.png)

# Cochlea

- Coiled structure, about 1 cm wide, and 5 mm from base to apex.
- Connects with middle ear via footplate of stapes which rests in oval window
- Sound causes the Oval Window to move in and out, which produces movement of the fluid in the cochlea, which in turn causes the Round Window to move in and out

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 17.56.32.png](%5B053%5D%20Peripheral%20and%20Central%20Auditory%20Processing%201%20305d5e48831e4209916e8d7db9f29ae6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_17.56.32.png)

- Cochlea consists of 3 compartments, Scala Vestibuli, Media and Tympani moving posteriorly

# Fluids of the Cochlea and Inner Ear

### Cochlea

- Scala vestibule: perilymph (↓ K⁺).
- Scala media: endolymph (↑ K⁺ produced and maintained by stria vascularis).
- ↓ K⁺ in the Endolymph causes deafness.
- Scala timpani: perilymph (↓ K⁺).

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 17.58.28.png](%5B053%5D%20Peripheral%20and%20Central%20Auditory%20Processing%201%20305d5e48831e4209916e8d7db9f29ae6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_17.58.28.png)

### Inner Ear

- Endolymph of vestibular apparatus (Semicircular Canals and Utricle/Saccule) is continuous with that of cochlea meaning that problems with endolymph will affect both systems together
- Bony labyrinth contains/is filled with perilymph.
- Membranous labyrinth: comprises semicircular canals and otolithic organs.
- Contains endolymph.

# Propagation of Mechanical Energy

- Sounds come into air canal, causing tympanic membrane to move, causing middle ear ossicles to move (oval window moves in and out), endolymph in cochlear moves, and Basilar Membrane moves up and down.
- Basilar membrane moves as a function of fluid moving.
    
    ![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 18.00.35.png](%5B053%5D%20Peripheral%20and%20Central%20Auditory%20Processing%201%20305d5e48831e4209916e8d7db9f29ae6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_18.00.35.png)

# Travelling Wave Along the Basilar Membrane

- Stapes causes vibrations of fluid, which causes deflections of basilar membrane up and down.
- Centre of deflection is fixed (peak):
- High dependence on frequency.
1. High frequency: basilar membrane at the base of cochlea deflects.
2. Low frequency: Basilar Membrane at the apex of cochlea deflects.
3. Complex sound: multiple travelling waves/deflections of the Basilar Membrane at discrete regions are seen along the cochlea.

# Frequency Tuning along the Basilar Membrane

$ω^2=\frac km$

- ω = Frequency (Increases with Stiffness and Decreases with Mass)
- k = Stiffness
- m = Mass
- Mass and stiffness along length determines frequency of BM vibration.
- The more stiff the BM is, the more resistance it will have to movement and hence, the higher the frequency required to displace it
- To produce movement at the BM, you have to move the entirety of the Cochlear Endolymph (which has a high mass at the Apex found distally and hence, vibrates at a low frequency but has a low mass at the base found proximally and hence, vibrates at a high frequency here)
- BM is relatively thin and stiff at base and hence vibrates at high frequencies
- BM is relatively thick and less stiff at apex and hence vibrates at low frequencies

# Movement of Organ of Corti and Transduction by Hair Cells

### Movement of the Organ of Corti

- Up-down movement of basilar membrane causes tectorial membrane to slide sideways (laterally and medially) over the hair cells, causing a sideways/lateral and medial displacement of hair cell bundles in cochlear hair cells relative to the Tectorial Membrane.
- As BM moves up, hair cells move one direction.
- As BM moves down, hair cells move in opposite direction.

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 18.03.43.png](%5B053%5D%20Peripheral%20and%20Central%20Auditory%20Processing%201%20305d5e48831e4209916e8d7db9f29ae6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_18.03.43.png)

### Transduction by Hair Cells

- Stereocilia of hair cell bundles are connected by tip links at their distal ends (act as small springs).
- Kineocilium = Tallest Stereocilium
- When BM moves up and down, Stereocilia move towards and away from the Kineocilium
- Movement of the Stereocilia bundle to and from the Kineocilium is thought to increase/decrease tension in tip links, thereby mechanically opening or closing stretch receptive K⁺ channels.
- K⁺ channel opening causes an influx of K⁺ from the K⁺ rich endolymph, depolarising the hair cell membrane. This opens voltage gated Ca²⁺ channels and allows for Ca²⁺ Influx, stimulating Glutamate release from hair cells that can stimulate the Auditory Nerve Fibres.

# Stretch Receptors and Hair Cells

### Inner Hair Cells (IHC)

- IHCs are passive.
- In response to vibration of BM, they perform a process of mechanoelectrical
transduction as when the BM Moves, their Vm changes and when it crosses threshold, it depolarises and generates AP in Auditory Nerve Fibres via Glutamate Release.
- They release neurotransmitter onto synapses of auditory nerve fibres (electro-chemical transduction), transmitting information along auditory nerve to brain.

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 18.08.39.png](%5B053%5D%20Peripheral%20and%20Central%20Auditory%20Processing%201%20305d5e48831e4209916e8d7db9f29ae6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_18.08.39.png)

### Outer Hair Cells (OHC)

- OHCs are active.
- Through electric-mechanical transduction, they contract to produce movement of the BM to which they are attached, feeding energy back into/amplifying the movements of the BM via Electro-Mechanical Conductio
- This process is responsible for sensitivity of hearing, and is vulnerable to damage by noise or ototoxic drugs, producing hearing loss here.
1. When BM Moves, OHCs are depolarised
2. When OHCs are depolarised, they contract as OHCs contain prestin, which changes shape when cell is depolarised and causes OHCs to change length. 
- As OHCs are connected to basilar membrane (via Deiter cells), contraction of OHCs cause the Basilar Membrane to move even more.
- This amplifies vibrations of BM (positive control) and hence act as sound amplifiers.

# Active Cochlea and Receptor Potentials

### Active Cochlea: Outer Hair Cell Hypersensitivity and Tuning

- OHCs amplify the movement/displacement of the BM, which increases the sensitivity of the ear to sounds
- The amount of OHC amplification produced depends on how much the Basilar Membrane is moving to begin with, with the region of the BM that is moving the most (peak of the BM Displacement curve, usually skewed towards the apex) being amplified the most
- This exaggerates differences in movement/amplitude along the Basilar Membrane, causing the Displacement Peak to become heightened more significantly than other regions of the curve
- This makes the Displacement Curve and peak narrower, increasing the frequency sensitivity of the ear (as different frequencies end up producing BM displacement curves that are more distinct/less overlapping which allows for these non-overlapping frequencies to be distinguished from one another)

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 18.12.42.png](%5B053%5D%20Peripheral%20and%20Central%20Auditory%20Processing%201%20305d5e48831e4209916e8d7db9f29ae6/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_18.12.42.png)

### Receptor Potentials

- At low frequencies, membrane potential of hair cell follows every cycle of stimulus (Produces an AC response) so that as the BM moves up and down, the Hair Cells become Depolarised and Repolarised as the Stereocilia move towards and away from the Kineocilia.
- At high frequencies, the vibrations of the BM are occurring at such a high rate that the membrane potential is unable to follow individual cycles of depolarisation and repolarisation, but instead remain at a steady state of depolarisation throughout duration of stimulus (Produces a DC response).
- At intermediate frequencies, membrane potential exhibits a mixed AC (Oscillating Component) + DC (Steady State) response so that there is a steady state of depolarisation with some oscillations in this depolarised state.

# Oto-Acoustic Emissions and Organ of Corti After Antibiotics

### Oto-Acoustic Emissions From the Cochlea

- Healthy cochlea generates sound. This is due to active, positive mechanical feedback (electro-mechanical transduction) of OHCs.
- If you present two tones to the ear simultaneously, the oscillating contraction of the OHCs will produce a quiet sound at a third frequency, which will cause the movement of the round window, tympanic membrane and air of the external ear so it can be detected by a microphone
- A joined earphones-microphone in the ear canal can detect sounds/Oto-Acoustic Emissions back from the 2 inputted sounds, which allows detection of whether outer hair cells are functioning well and hence, determine if baby has Neonatal Hearing Loss due to OHC dysfunction.

### Organ of Corti After Antibiotics

- Outer hair cells are susceptible to drugs
(high dosage).
- Kanamycin: given for jaundice.
