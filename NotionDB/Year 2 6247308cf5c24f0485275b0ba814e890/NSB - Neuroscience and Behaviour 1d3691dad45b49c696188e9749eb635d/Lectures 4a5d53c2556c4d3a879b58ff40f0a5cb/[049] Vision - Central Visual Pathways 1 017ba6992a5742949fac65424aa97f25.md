# [049] Vision - Central Visual Pathways 1

# Parallel Pathways

- Visual information travels from the retina through the optic nerve to the Optic Chiasm and then tract towards the LGN and from there to the visual cortex.
- The visual information is decomposed (there is extraction of different features of visual information E.g Colour, Edges) and different types of information are processed in parallel streams and then reunited in the Primary Visual Cortex to form a complete image.
- All functionally parallel pathways are kept separate on their path from the retina cell to the visual cortex.
- They are anatomically organized by:
1. Ganglion cell type
2. Their location on the retina
3. Right-eye/left-eye origin

# Lateral Geniculate Nucleus and Primary Visual Cortex

### Retinotopic Projections from Retina to Lateral Geniculate Nucleus to V1

- Neighbouring locations on retina project to corresponding neighbouring locations on LGN, which project to corresponding neighbouring locations on V1.
- This regular projection pattern and organisation of these projections in the LGN and V1 means that the spacial relationship of the visual information is preserved from the Outside world through all of the processing stages (Visual Information is organised in the Retina, LGN and V1 in a manner that corresponds to how the Information is arranged in the Outside World, producing a Retinotopic Map in each of these processing regions)

### Lateral Geniculate Nucleus

- Organised into 6 Layers, numbered 1-6 moving dorsally
- P-Cell Ganglion Cells in the Retina project to Parvocellular cells in layers 3-6
- M Type Ganglion Cells in the Retina project to Magnocellular Cells in layers 1-2
- K Type Ganglion Cells project to Koniocellular layer that is found in the spaces between each of the Layers of the LGN
- Contralateral P Type Cells in the Retina project to Layers 6 and 4 of the LGN containing Parvocellular Cells
- Ipsilateral P Cells in the Retina project to layers 5 and 3 of the LGN Containing Parvocellular Cells
- Ipsilateral and Contralateral M Type Cells in the Retina project to Layers 2 and 1 of the LGN Containing Magnocellular Cells respectively
- K Cells in the Retina show the same ipsilateral/contralateral projection pattern to the Koniocellular Cells of the LGN as the Layer found overlying it

- Cortex is layered, and different cell types dominate different layers.
- Both LGN and V1 are layered, with different cell types that are found predominantly in different layers

### Termination of Lateral Geniculate Nucleus Cells in V1

- Magnocellular Layer of the LGN (Layers 1-2) projects to 4Cùõº layer of V1
- Parvocellular Layer of the LGN (Layers 3-6) project to 4CùõΩ layer of V1
- Koniocellular Layers of the LGN project into patchy patterns in layers II and III of V1.

# Ocular Dominance Columns and Basic Cortical Module of Image Processing

### Ocular Dominance Columns

- Layer IV is the major target/end projection point of LGN neurons and hence, right eye left eye origin here is preserved.
- LGN axons of left and right eye inputs are segregated/separated from one another within layer IV.
- Autoradiography: inputs from 1 retina gives bright stripes on dark background ‚Üí Ocular Dominance Columns.

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 12.22.32.png](%5B049%5D%20Vision%20-%20Central%20Visual%20Pathways%201%20017ba6992a5742949fac65424aa97f25/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_12.22.32.png)

### Basic Cortical Module : Image Processing

- All of the Visual Maps (Orientation, Ocular Dominance, Motion etc.), formed via Feature Extraction and subsequent parallel processing of different aspects of visual information, are found present simultaneously in V1
- Each point in space (Retinotopy) is analysed by a dedicated cortical module, which are repeated along the visual cortex.
- Module comprised of group of cells is 2mm¬≥ in volume
- This module contains all the various neural elements required to deconstruct object characteristics for Parallel Processing and hence, form a complete image
- The Retinotopic Organisation in V1 of each of the cells involved in the Parallel Processing of Visual Information means that each point in Visual Space is analysed by a dedicated Cortical Module, with each aspect of Visual Information being analysed separately
- It contains a group of cells with different and specialised tuning frequency, representing different types of information about a specific point in visual space, providing a complete image of that point in visual space
- Ocular dominance columns: These are found in Layer IV, in an alternating Right-Left Pattern
- Orientation columns: This contains neurons that are sensitive to different orientations so that they fire the most when the edges/bars are aligned with the preferential orientation of the neuron
- Various different orientation selective neurons are found organised around a central point so that a specific region of V1 contains orientation specific neurons that are selective for a wide range of orientations
- These columns are found throughout all Layers of the Cortex except Layer IV
- Blobs: colour sensation - These are found interspersed between the various columns of Visual Information.
- All small components within the Nodule are processed to form a visual concept

# Visual Perception

### Visual Field Test

- These are used as diagnostic tools to find and localise lesions in the visual system
- This is possible due to the regular, ordered and well documented projection pathway from the Retina to V1 and the clear and ordered projection of the Visual Field onto the Retina and Retinotopy throughout the visual system
- Retinotopy = Mapping of visual input from the Retina to V1 (Retinal Mapping)
- Px's Head is fixed and Px looks at screen with an array of LED Lights, which light up randomly, in a random time period
- During this period, The patient presses a button to confirm that they can see LED light up, producing a map of the visual field where light areas are the areas that can be seen and black/dark spots are those that cannot.
- This is repeated a few times to ensure the visual field recording produced is accurate
- Normally, all of the visual field except for blind spot (usually found in the Superolateral Aspect of the Inferolateral Quadrant of the Visual Field) should be seen.

### Mononuclear Blindness

- This is caused by a complete lesion of the Optic Nerve unilaterally
- This causes complete loss of vision of the Ipsilateral Eye

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 12.08.29.png](%5B049%5D%20Vision%20-%20Central%20Visual%20Pathways%201%20017ba6992a5742949fac65424aa97f25/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_12.08.29.png)

### Bitemporal Hemianopia

- This is caused at a lesion at the Decussation of the Optic Chiasm (E.g possible cause would be a pituitary gland tumour that destroys all decussating nasal fibres).
- This causes loss of vision in the Temporal Fields Bilaterally due to a lesion at crossover/decussation which damages the Nasal Fibres decussating here whilst Temporal Fibres are unaffected.
- As the Temporal Retinal Fibres do not decussate, they are unaffected here, so vision from the Nasal Visual Field is preserved

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 12.09.12.png](%5B049%5D%20Vision%20-%20Central%20Visual%20Pathways%201%20017ba6992a5742949fac65424aa97f25/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_12.09.12.png)

### Homonymous Hemianopia

- This is due to lesion in the Optic Tract unilaterally, leading to loss of vision from equivalent areas of visual field (homonymous loss).
- This primarily presents as loss of vision from the Ipsilateral Nasal Field and Contralateral Temporal Field (AKA Loss of Vision from Contralateral Hemifield)
- More Distally,  This can be caused by a larger lesion across the entirety of the Optic Radiation or a lesion in the Optic Radiation found more distally/closer to V1 (affecting both Lateral and Medial Fibres of the Optic Radiation)

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 12.09.52.png](%5B049%5D%20Vision%20-%20Central%20Visual%20Pathways%201%20017ba6992a5742949fac65424aa97f25/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_12.09.52.png)

### Superior Quadrantanopia

- This causes 25% of equivalent visual field (Contralateral Hemifield) is lost due to a lesion in proximal/anterior aspect of the optic radiation (Meyer‚Äôs loop - Contains lateral fibres of the Optic Radiation) which arcs medially from the Optic Tract Anterolaterally to the Occipital Lobe Posteromedially.
- This loss of the Superior Region of the Ipsilateral Nasal Field and the Superior Region of the Contralateral Temporal Visual Field.
- This means that as the location of the Lesion in the Optic Radiation is found more posteriorly/distally, the extent of the vision loss produced increases

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 12.10.53.png](%5B049%5D%20Vision%20-%20Central%20Visual%20Pathways%201%20017ba6992a5742949fac65424aa97f25/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_12.10.53.png)

### Macular Sparing

- Macular sparing is defined as sparing of the central 5-10 degree of visual field (corresponding to the location of the macula) in an otherwise hemianoptic defect.
- One possible explanation (if the hemianopia is caused by a stroke) is due to a separate/different blood supply to the affected/peripheral retina and the unaffected Macular regions, with the stroke compromising blood supply to the peripheral retina but not affecting the macula.
- Conversely in congruous homonymous macular defect (not shown) only the central region of the visual field are affected likely caused by a stroke in the vasculature supplying the Macula, whilst the blood supply to the Peripheral Retina is unaffected.

# Projection of the Visual Field Onto the Retina

- Image on retina is upside down compared to actual image.
- Monocular portion: This is the lateral region of the visual field seen by 1 eye only.
- Binocular portion: This is the medial egion of the visual field seen by both eyes.

![Screenshot 2021-12-10 at 12.02.03.png](%5B049%5D%20Vision%20-%20Central%20Visual%20Pathways%201%20017ba6992a5742949fac65424aa97f25/Screenshot_2021-12-10_at_12.02.03.png)

# Right and Left Visual Hemifields

- Full visual fields (FVF): This is the area viewed by both eyes.
- Left/right hemi-field: divides FVF into 2, separated by a central sagittal line through the fixation point.
- Binocular VF: The area of overlap between left and right hemi-fields, seen by both eyes.
- Temporal and Nasal Retina = Lateral and Medial Retina
- Objects within the binocular field of left hemi-field are imaged by nasal/medial retina of left eye and temporal/lateral retina of right eye.
- Objects within the Binocular Field of the Right Hemifield are imaged by the Right Nasal Retina and Left Temporal Retina
- Objects outside of/lateral to the left binocular field imaged by only nasal retina of left eye.
- Objects outside of/lateral to the right binocular field imaged by only the Right Nasal Retina
- Fibres from nasal retina decussate at optic chiasm to project down the Contralateral Optic Tract whilst fibres from the Temporal Retina do not and project down the Ipsilateral Optic Tract.
- This means that the Right Optic Tract conveys information from the Right Temporal Retina and Left Nasal Retina (Visualises Left Hemifield) whilst the Left Optic Tract conveys information from the Left Temporal Retina and Right Nasal Retina (Visualises Right Hemifield)
- Left visual hemi-field is viewed by right hemi-sphere and vice versa.
