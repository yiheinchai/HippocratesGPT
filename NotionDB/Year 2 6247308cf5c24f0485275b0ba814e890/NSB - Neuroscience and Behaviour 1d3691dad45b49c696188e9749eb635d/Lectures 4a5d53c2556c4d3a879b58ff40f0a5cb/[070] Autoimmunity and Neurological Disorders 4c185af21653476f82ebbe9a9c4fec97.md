# Immune System

### Adaptive/Acquired

| T Cell Immunity | Suppressor, Helper and Cytotoxic |
| --- | --- |
| B Cell Immunity | Humoural |

### Innate

| Physical Barriers | Skin
Mucous membranes
Saliva
Flushing action of urine and tears
Stomach acid |
| --- | --- |
| Blood-Bourne | Complement
Phagocytes
Acute Phase Proteins |

### Nervous System

| Type of Nervous System | Components | Anatomical Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CNS | Brain and Spinal Cord | Special Anatomical Features limit inflammation in the CNS |
| PNS | Peripheral and Autonomic Nerves | Similar anatomical features limit inflammation in the PNS |
- Blood-brain barrier and blood-nerve barrier are anatomical features of the nervous system that limit movement of immune and inflammatory cells and some humoral factors.
- The immune system is highly interconnected and interdependent network, regulating and enhancing each other where appropriate

# Blood Brain Barrier

- Between Cerebral Vasculature and the Brain Parenchyma, Epithelial Cells of Blood Vessels are connected by Tight Junctions, significantly reducing their permeability
- Pericyte: contractile cell that wraps around endothelial cells that line capillaries and venules throughout body.
- Cells (soluble in fat) are able to pass
through relatively easily.

### The CNS Is Not an Immune Privileged Site

- Lymphatic drainage not classical, unlike other parts of the body.
- Lymphoid cells are normally excluded from CNS and PNS.
- It has specialised lymphatic drainage, known as the Glymphatic System as it involves Glial Cells which form the walls of the drainage system.
- Macrophages are physiologically present in CNS.
- Lymphoid cells can enter CNS and PNS where they are involved in immune surveillance.
- Classical immune reactions are limited from CNS and PNS in order to avoid detrimental consequences of intrathecal/subarachnoid swelling within physical space restrictions.

# Bone Marrow Derived Macrophages of the CNS

| Name | Location | Rate of Replenishment from Blood Monocytes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microglia | Parenchyma | +  |
| Perivascular Macrophages | Basal Lamina of Small Blood Vessels | ++ |
| Meningeal Macrophages | Meninges | +++ |
| Choroid Plexus Macrophages | Interface between CSF and Blood | ++ |

---

# Microglia

- Resident macrophages of CNS.
- Largely replaced by proliferation of local microglia.
- First line of defence in CNS.
- They contain many branching mobile processes that survey the Parenchyma of the Brain in search of Ag
- Phagocytic
- Present antigen to T cells (via MHC Class II)
- Secrete pro-inflammatory factors: IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-ùõº.

### Activation States of Microglia

- There is an association between morphology and function.
- Resting microglia are hugely branched with small bodies.
- They exist in CNS, searching and do not produce inflammatory factors.
- When there is small local damage to blood vessels, Microglia become alerted, with the detection of pathogens causing the Microglia to become further activated and assume a Phagocytic Phenotype
- If there is large damage to the CNS or if Infectious Agents are involved, Microglia assume a Reactive Phenotype where they can become Phagocytic and Pro-Inflammatory
- These do not have many process processes.

# Routes of Entry into the CNS for Other Immune Cells

1. Across BBB into brain.
2. Across blood-spinal cord barrier into spinal cord.
3. Across choroid plexus into CSF-filled spaces
- Immune cells: rolling ‚Üí activation ‚Üí arrest ‚Üí crawling ‚Üí migrations (moving down blood flow).
- Microglia secretes chemokines stimulating vascular endothelial cells to present molecules to attract and bind to immune cells utilising selective ligands that are continuously expressed on the immune cells.
- E.g VCAM-1 and P-Selectin Receptors on Vascular Endothelium are selective for VLA-4 and PSGL-1 Ligands on Immune Cells
- Binding of Vascular Endothelial Receptors and Immune Cell Ligands activates the Immune Cell, causing them to Arrest (stop migrating)
- These Immune Cells are then pulled towards the Vascular Endothelial Cells, where they change shape and express further molecules to facilitate Migration across the BBB (Across Tight Junctions or across the cells themselves)
- BBB then expresses low levels of molecules able to bind to immune cells.

# Multiple Sclerosis

- Sclerosis: Greek ‚Äòskleros‚Äô meaning hard.
- These hard areas are plaques.
- Multiple: many different areas of CNS may have damaged myelin.
- Definition: segmental primary demyelination.
- Can occur at any age, but in most cases, symptoms are first seen between ages 20-40.
- Most common neurological condition amongst young adults in UK.
- Affects 85,000 people (110 140/100,000/year).
- Female:male approx. 2:1.
- Polygenic: Increased risk for Px expressing HLA-DR15/DR6 in Caucasians.
- Characterised by discrete pathological and symptomatic episodes separated in time and space.
- This means that Sclerotic Plaques often appear and then disappear over time, occurring in throughout the Brain, producing a Variable yet progressive pattern of Pathology and Sx
- It is an extremely disabling disease around 50% of patients unable to walk unaided within 15 years of diagnosis.

- Tracer is given IV that should not cross BBB.
- When lesion occurs, tracer shows up as white.
- However, brain can heal. This just shows that MS is very variable throughout year.

# Histopathology of Multiple Sclerosis

- Histopathology, if sample can be obtained (normally obtained once patient is dead, rarely when live), shows loss of myelin.
- These are mainly found around blood vessels, with affected vessels being surrounded by Immune Cell Cuffs that have infiltrate the Blood Vessel walls (APC Immune Cells)
- Usually, Auto-Ab seen in MS initially are directed against Myelin Associated Glycoprotein and as the disease develops, Abs appear against MBP/Myelin Basic Protein, MOG/Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein and PLP/Proteolipid Protein

### Histopathological Characteristics

- Inflammation: microglial activation and perivascular cuff.
- Segmental demyelination
- Neurodegeneration
- Gliosis: astrocytic scar - In End Stage MS.

### Lesions

- Lesions can be found anywhere in the Brain (White or Grey) but can be divided into Cortical and Subcortical Lesions
- White Matter lesions have been divided into 3 categories:
1. Type 1 = Contain Lots of Macrophages and T Cells
2. Type 2 = Contain lots of Compliment and Ab
3. Type 3 = Few Immune Cells but contain Apoptotic Oligodendrocytes
- Over time, these acute lesions can change into Smoldering Lesions, where Microglia are continuously active and damaging the myelin sheath, with few immune cells present (As Inflammation has been resolved)
- In Chronic Inactive Lesions, there are no/few cells surrounding the Demyelinated Axon
- In rare cases, Remyelinated Lesions can be found where neighbouring Oligodendrocytes or new Oligodendrocytes from Progenitor cells reform the Myelin Sheath

# Pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis - Current Theories

- What makes Immune Cells cross into the CNS, why Myelin is selectively targeted and how Myelin is destroyed is currently unknown/not confirmed
- Most prevalent and established theory is that MS is a progressive neurodegenerative and demyelinating disease caused by Autoimmune Response to self-Ag in Genetically Susceptible Individuals (Studies show this Genetic Susceptibility is of minor importance)
- More recent theories suggest that MS Lesions contain significant signs of Oligodendrocyte Apoptosis and Microglial Activation with few Myelin-Specific Macrophages or Lymphocytes
- This suggests that Immune Cell involvement in the formation of Sclerotic Plaques occur after the lesion has formed, potentially to limit damage caused by the Lesion and clear up Debris (They do not trigger the Formation of the Lesion)
- Autoimmune hypothesis: no proof (only circumstantial evidence from Histopathological Analysis).
- Chronic viral infection: however, no virus has been definitely associated with MS (retrovirus?).
- A Genetically determined neuroglial degenerative process with secondary inflammation has been presented as the most likely pathogenesis of MS.
- Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) - Largely disproved.
- New theories suggest that Infection of paranasal sinuses where infectious agent (or toxins) travel via cranial nerves into CNS.
- There are many reasons as to why determining the Pathogenesis of MS is difficult:
1. As it is not possible to predict when and where a MS Lesion will appear, it is not possible to isolate and study a lesion in the initial stages of its formation

# Myasthenia Gravis

- Disorder of neuromuscular transmission characterised by abnormal fatigability of
skeletal muscle ranging from transient double vision to life-threatening respiratory paralysis.
- Prevalence is 1 in 10,000.
- All ages can be affected.
- Often presents with weakness in muscles controlling eye and
eyelid movement.
- Transient neonatal myasthenia in 10% of babies born to myasthenic mothers due to transfer of maternal IgG autoantibodies into the fetal circulation.

# Guillain-Barre Syndrome

- Inflammatory peripheral demyelinated neuropathy (does not affect CNS).
- Often preceded by a viral-like illness. Cause unknown, but myelin and nerve axons destroyed.
- First symptoms are numbness, paraesthesia (burning or prickling sensation), weakness, pain in limbs.
- Progressive, bilateral, ascending and relatively symmetrical weakness of limbs.
- Significant mortality risk.
- Residual neurological deficit common.
- Rare but important disease.
- Incidence: 1-2/100,000/year.
- Male:female is 1.8:1. ‚Üë incidence with age throughout life.
- Treatment: intravenous Ig or plasma exchange.
- Respiratory insufficiency in 25% of patients.
- 5% of patients die from respiratory failure, pulmonary emboli or infection.
- 20% of patients have residual disability with weakness or persistent sensory disturbance.
- Often appears triggered by 1 of a number of events:
1. Upper respiratory tract infection (2/3 of cases).
2. Diarrhoea and gut infection (2/3 of cases).
3. Immunisation
4. Pregnancy
5. Lymphoma
- URTI known to cause Guillain-Barre Syndrome include Campylobacter jejuni (Mainly), Cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, Varicella-zoster virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae

# Histopathology and Pathogenesis of Guillain-Barr

### Histopathology

- Mononuclear cell infiltration of peripheral nerves.
- Antibodies to myelin components.
- T cell activation.
- Neurodegeneration

### Pathogenesis - Autoimmunity Triggered by Molecular Mimicry

- Pathogen cell wall contain ceramide.
- Analysing GM-1, from campylobacter, is actually same as the oligosaccharides found within the Nerve Cell Membranes.
- Immune system therefore sees pathogen, and produces antibodies against GM-1 to neutralise pathogen, which also target oligosaccharides in the nerve cell membrane, leading to Macrophage Activation.
- These macrophages migrate into the Myelin Sheath, next to the Axon, and produce Demyelination
