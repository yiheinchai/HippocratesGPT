# [068] States of Consciousness, Sleep and Coma

# Electroencephalogram

- This usually contains 21 electrodes, placed in Occipital, Parietal, Temporal and Frontal Pole Positions on the Scalp

### 10-20 EEG Electrode Configuration

- Inion: below occipital bone.
- Nasion: just above nose.
- Configuration is named as 10-20 as superiorly from the Nasion and the Inion (with the Centre of the Head as the Midpoiny), the Electrodes are placed at  a point so that there is a 10¬∞ angle between the electrode and the Nasion and Inion, with all subsequent electrodes being placed at regions on the Scalp so that there are 20¬∞ angles between 2 Electrodes in the Sagittal Plane
- In the Coronal Plane, the First Electrode is placed so that there is a 10¬∞ Angle between the Electrode and the Preauricular Point (Just Anterior to the Ear), with Electrodes being placed at points so that there are 20¬∞ Angles between the Electrodes in the Coronal Plane

### Standard Electrode Positions for High Density EEG Recordings

- For Research Purposes to produce Higher Resolution EEGs, High Density EEG Recordings can be used, requiring More Electrodes, with there being smaller angles between each electrodes

### EEG Recordings can be Bipolar or Unipolar

- Bipolar Recordings record voltage difference between 2 electrodes on the Scalp
- Bipolar recordings may reduce background distortion of EEGs are not as useful for EEGs as if there is a voltage change in the region of the scalp found equidistant from both electrodes, this would produce an identical/similar voltage in the 2 electrodes.
- This would mean that the Voltage Difference between the 2 Electrodes would be very small, producing a very small signal
- However, this would cause large voltage differences between an electrode found near the region of the Voltage Change and another Electrode found further away from the region of Voltage Change but still near to the first electrode, producing an abnormally large signal here that may indicate that the signal is closer to the further away electrode, when it actually isn‚Äôt.
- Unipolar Recording are made against a single Reference Electrode placed away from the Scalp (E.g on the Ear - This may produce more background disturbance of the EEG as its location off the Scalp means it is not recording changes in Scalp Voltage) or against the sum of several other electrodes within the Array placed on the Scalp

### EEG Reveal Summed Activity of Populations of Cortical Neurons

- With afferent input to cortical pyramidal neurons, there is +ve current flow into Neuronal Dendrites found superficially, that runs deep to reach deeper axon terminals/soma
- This produces a relative superficial negativity (at the dendrites) in comparison to the deeper, more positive soma/axon terminal where the positive current is propagating towards
- EEG electrodes on scalp detect these changes but summate potentials from many thousands of neurons found in the Cortical Regions near the Electrode.
- You would not be able to detect single neuron activity.
- Electrodes need to be large to overcome large impedance of scalp.
- EEGs primarily record cerebral cortical activity (not sub-cortical).
- If there is irregular, independent activity in neurons found near each other, then summated EEG recording is high frequency but low amplitude as the lack of synchronicity of neuronal firing means that each neuron will create its own peak when it fires and will not summate on top of each other to make a stronger signal
- If neurons found near each other fire simultaneously at one moment of time, there is summation of the signals to produce low frequency but high amplitude EEG Traces

# Normal EEG

- ùú∂ rhythm: 8-13 Hz (High Frequency). Typical of quiet restfulness in an awake patient (E.g Awake but with eyes closed).
- This is typically seen in Occipital and Parietal Electrodes but not really in Frontal Electrodes
- When Opening the Eyes, activation of eye muscles can generate artefactual electrical signals which are detected by Frontal Electrodes to produce large amplitude (negative amplitude) blink artefacts
- ùú∑ rhythm: (13-30 Hz Signals) - Lower Amplitude indicating that Cortical neurons are firing in a desynchronised manner (neurons are active independent)
- This is characteristic of alert, wakefulness.

# Synchronising Activity in a Population of Neurons and Oscillatory Activity in a 2-Neuron Loop

### Synchronising Activity in a Population of Neurons

- Synchronicity of Cortical Electrode Firing (Seen in ùú∂-rhythms) can occur in 2 ways:
1. Pacemaker: Cortical Neurons that are being recorded are all receiving input from a single neuron (Pacemaker) simulaneously
- This is an extreme form and doesn‚Äôt really happen
1. Interactions: Excitatory and Inhibitory Projections between neuronal populations that are being recorded by the EEG produce synchronised patterns of activity
- Inhibitory and excitatory loop can set-up an oscillatory cycle.
- Both options operate at level of cerebral cortex

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 18.37.35.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_18.37.35.png)

### Oscillatory Activity in a 2-Neuron Loop

- Excitatory Neurons project to Inhibitory Neurons, which project to the same Excitatory Neuron
- When there is Constant Excitatory Drive into the Excitatory Neuron within the Loop, Excitation of the Excitatory Neuron excites the Inhibitory Neuron
- This increases the activity of the Inhibitory Neuron to reduce the activity of the Excitatory Neuron that is stimulating it
- This causes the activity of the Excitatory Neuron to fall which reduces the stimulation of the Inhibitory Neuron
- This reduces inhibition of the Excitatory, causing it to become active once again, causing the Oscillating activity of the Loop to continue
- This produces Phase Differences between the Excitatory and Inhibitory Neuron, where the activity of the Excitatory Neuron just preceeds that of the Inhibitory Neuron and the Activity of the Excitatory Neuron ends just before the Inhibitory Neuron stops firing

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 18.38.33.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_18.38.33.png)

### Rhythms in Thalamus Drive Rhythms in the Cerebral Cortex

- Within the Thalamus, there are local inhibitory interneurons that receive collaterals from Excitatory Neurons projecting to the Cerebral Cortex
- These excitatory collaterals and Inhibitory Interneurons establish an Oscillatory Loop to modulate the activity of the Excitatory Thalamic Neuron to hence produce oscillations in the Activity of Cortical Neurons

# Different Wave Frequencies Seen in an EEG

- ùú∂ rhythms: 8-13 Hz. This is seen where a Px is awake, resting (and commonly eyes closed), seen more common in occipital regions, especially here where spindling occurs. These can either have a constant amplitude or oscillating amplitude to produce a sine-wave appearance
- ùú∑ rhythm: 13-30 Hz. Alert and aroused brain activity. High frequency activity with low amplitude as they are caused by the desynchronised firing of cortical neurons (These are often detected in Frontal and Parietal Regions when Px are alert and attentive).
- ùúΩ region: 4-8 Hz in cerebral cortex with large amplitudes due to increased synchronicity of cortical neurons. Associated in adults with early/light sleep. Seen in children when they are not sleeping.
- ùúπ region: 0.5 Hz and extremely large amplitude. Deep stage of sleep. Can be seen in infants during general wakefulness even when they are not sleeping.
- Spikes/epilepsy: These are abnormal waves that are high frequency and high amplitude due to pathological hyperactivity and synchronicity of cortical neurons. 3 Hz Spikes are characterised of Absent Seizures

# Sleep

- Readily reversible state of reduced responsiveness to, and interaction with environment.
- Sleep is characterised by several stages that can be recognised in EEG and a variety of physiological changes.
- Coma and general anaesthesia are not readily reversible changes in consciousness and have properties very different form sleep.

### Stages of Sleep

- Traditionally, Sleep is broken down into Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and the 4 Stages of Non-REM (NREM) Sleep, as identified by the EEG
- From awake state, subjects pass through sleep stages 1-4 each with EEG patterns changing from fast, small waves to slow, large waves in stage 4.
- From Stage 4, Then order reverses as subject moves from stages 4-1 and subjects re-enters rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.
- Deepest Stages of Sleep occur in the early stages of the sleep period with the sleep becoming less deep on average with each progressive cycle before the subject awakens (Duration of Stage 3-4 Decreases as the sleep progresses)
- Cycle repeats through night, with ‚Üë duration of REM periods with each progressive cycle
- Dreaming occurs during REM sleep.
- Stages progress with ‚Üì frequency and ‚Üë amplitude.
- Awake: ùõº rhythm (rest and awake) and ùõΩ rhythm (alert and aroused/attentive).
- REM: ùõΩ rhythm. Characterises alert state.
- Stage 1: ùúÉ rhythm.
- Stage 2: spindling (short bursts of 4-18 Hz activity) occurs on ùúÉ rhythm, with the occasional appearance of a K complex (Single ùõø wave with a frequency characteristic of 0.5-4 Hz and a large amplitude).
- Stage 3: <50% of brain waves are ùõø rhythm.
- Stage 4: >50% of brain waves are ùõø rhythm.
- Stage 3 + 4 = Slow Wave Sleep/Stage 3-4 as it contains low frequency ùõø waves
- When we sleep, we reach stage 4 very quickly. Then reverses, and reach REM. Cycle repeats.
- Later on, in night, do not reach stage 4 again. Eventually, no stage 3 either.
- As night progresses, ‚Üë duration of REM sleep, and ‚Üì frequency of deep sleep.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 18.42.02.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_18.42.02.png)

### Purpose of Sleep

- In slow-wave sleep, muscle tension is reduced.
- Body is capable of movement (e.g. adjust body position) but few movements made.
- Temperature and metabolism lowered.
- Energy use by the brain is reduced.
- In REM sleep, brain is active but body movements (except eye movements) are paralyzed.
- Temperature control is lost ‚Äì so it drifts down, heart and respiratory control become irregular.
- Metabolic activity of the brain is higher than in awake state.
- Adaptive theories of sleep suggest it may have developed to conserve energy.
- Sleep may be restorative ‚Äì a common sense explanation.
- Prolonged sleep deprivation leads to serious physiological and cognitive disturbances.
- Just REM sleep deprivation produces these cognitive and physiological effects. But what is being restored or rested? The Answer is unknown.
- Sleep is essential for memory formation ‚Äì consolidation processes to transfer Short Term Memories into Long Term Memories.
- REM and Slow Wave Sleep are now known to be important for memory formation.
- Memories appear to depend upon synaptic strengths/efficacy.
- Synaptic homeostasis theories of sleep suggest that sleep manages the overall levels of synaptic strength, normalizing the majority of Synapses and their efficacy encoding information deemed to be irrelevant/not important while maintaining the changes underlying memories (Increased Synaptic Strengths/Efficacies) for the day‚Äôs events which are important and need to be translated into Long Term Memory

# Neural and Physiological Changes during Sleep and Nightmares

### Physiological Changes During Sleep

- EEG mainly measures the activity of Cortical Regions and does not detect the activity of Subcortical Regions
- Jouvet identified stages of sleep in cats.
- Paradoxical sleep is equivalent to REM sleep, light sleep is equivalent to stages 1-2.
- During Light Sleep, there is significant Hippocampal Activity and during REM Sleep, there is High frequency, oscillatory activity in Paradoxical Sleep which is important for memory formation and stabilisation
- Most body muscle activity is reduced but present in light sleep at low levels but is completely absent in REM sleep, as all skeletal muscle is paralysed/inactive in REM sleep.
- Eye movements are prominent in REM sleep as only the extraocular muscles are active in REM Sleep there is strong Saccadic Eye Movements, producing High Amplitude, Low Frequency waves
- In Light Sleep, the activity of Extraocular Muscles is reduced but in REM Sleep
- In REM Sleep, Respiratory Activity is very low

# Diffuse Modulatory Systems of the Brain that Control Sleep and Wakefulness (Ascending Arousal System)

- Noradrenaline system: source is from locus coeruleus into the pons. Sends long excitatory axons through cerebral cortex, to pons, hypothalamus, into temporal lobe, cerebellum and descending projections down into the spinal cord.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 18.45.28.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_18.45.28.png)

- Acetylcholine system: Source is from the Basal nucleus of Meynert (used in treatment of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease) to the cerebral cortex and medial septal nuclei (found in the Pontomesencephalotegmental Complex) to the Thalamus, Hypothalamus, Hippocampus and the Pons

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 18.45.37.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_18.45.37.png)

- 5-HT system: Raphe nuclei in brainstem. Project down spinal cord, into cerebellum and forebrain (Thalamus, Hypothalamus and Cerebral Cortex) generally but also down the spinal cord.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 18.47.12.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_18.47.12.png)

- Dopamine system: ventral tegmental area to frontal cortex. Substantia nigra to Striatum (Nigrostriatal).

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 18.46.43.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_18.46.43.png)

- Histaminergic System: Source from Tuberomamillary Nucleus of the Hypothalamus all over the Forebrain, Brainstem, Cerebellum and Spinal Cord

# Ascending Arousal System

- Projections from brainstem and posterior hypothalamus throughout forebrain.
- Cholinergic Inputs to the Thalamus are excitatory and promote Cortical Activity
- Laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (LTD) and the Pedunculopontine Tegmental Nuclei (PPT) project to and excite the Thalamus to increase Cortical Activity
- Monoaminergic nuclei stimulate Cortical Activity via direct projections to the Cortex
- Neurons of Tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) contain histamine (HIST), neurons of raphe nuclei contain 5HT and neurons of locus coeruleus (LC) contain NA.
- Ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) project neurons that release GABA and galanin (Gal) to inhibit the Ascending Arousal System to promote sleep.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 18.50.00.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_18.50.00.png)

### Ventrolateral Preoptic Nucleus (VLPO) Inhibits the Main Components of the Ascending Arousal System

- Inhibitory GABAergic output from VLPO reduces activity in nuclei of ascending arousal system (Tuberomamillary Nucleus, Raphe Nuclei, Locus Coeruleus and Laterodorsal Tegmental Nucleus and Pedunculopontine Tegmental Nucleus). Thus, VLPO activity promotes sleep

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 18.50.07.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_18.50.07.png)

### Hypothalamic Orexin/Hypocretin Neurons Activate the Main Components of the Ascending Arousal System

- (excitatory) Orexin/hypocretin neurons from lateral hypothalamic area
innervate and excite all components of ascending arousal system, as well as
cerebral cortex (CTX) itself.
- Activity of hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neurones promote wakefulness.

# Ascending Arousal System - Fast Glutamatergic and GABAergic Systems

- Monoaminergic, cholinergic, and peptidergic neurons in the brainstem and hypothalamus play a modulatory role in sleep-wakefulness but when these regions of the Ascending Arousal System are lesioned, they do not cause complete loss of wakefulness and arousal.
- But direct glutamatergic input to the Cortex from parabrachial nucleus (PB) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) to the basal forebrain, and the GABAergic and cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain (BF) that diffusely but directly innervate the cerebral cortex may be even more important.
- Lesions at these sites cause complete loss of consciousness.
- In addition, GABAergic neurons in lateral hypothalamus (LH) promote wakefulness by inhibiting sleep promoting neurons in the thalamus and preoptic area.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 23.19.19.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_23.19.19.png)

- The fast neurotransmitter systems that contribute to sleep promotion (shown in purple).
- Ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) and median preoptic (MnPO) GABAergic neurons inhibit most components of
the acending arousal system, including the fast glutamatergic PB.
- Parafacial zone (PFZ) GABAergic neurons in the medulla induce sleep mainly by inhibiting the parabrachial glutamatergic arousal neurons.
- Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus contain both GABA and glutamate, and may be able to release them at different terminal sites.
- They innervate neurons in the brainstem that control REM sleep.

# Sleep - Daily Cycle

- Physiology varies on daily basis (circadian rhythm).
- Environmental cues: variations in light and dark, temperature etc. entrain a biological clock so that it becomes synchronised to a cycle that lasts exactly 24 hours.
- If environmental cues are removed, there is elongation of the duration of Circadian Rhythms with human sleep/wakefulness cycle settling to about 25 hours.
- After many days, this cycle may shift to 30-36 hours, though physiological function may not keep in step.

![Screenshot 2022-01-11 at 18.51.24.png](%5B068%5D%20States%20of%20Consciousness,%20Sleep%20and%20Coma%20692697b88afb4e2b8b381dd342c630d3/Screenshot_2022-01-11_at_18.51.24.png)

# Suprachiasmatic Nucleus of the Hypothalamus

- A paired hypothalamic nucleus shown in sagittal (a) and coronal (b) sections, found just superior to the Optic Chiasm.
- Electrical stimulation of suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) shifts circadian rhythm.
- SCN receives a direct input from retina that normally detects day/light cycle, allowing it to become sensitive to periodic variations in light intensity that correspond with day and night, allowing it to establish a 24-hour Circadian Rhythm to regulate other physiological processes.
- SCN lesions destroy intrinsic 24-hour circadian rhythm of sleeping/waking and activity.
- But light-dark periods can still be detected and sleep patterns co-ordinated to match them.
- SCN neurons are inhibitory and project to other hypothalamic and midbrain
regions.
- Here they influence arousal systems to regulate sleep and waking.

# Sleep Disorders

### Apnoea

- Central sleep apnoea: Reduced central respiratory drive to diaphragm during sleep.
- Reduced muscle tone in non-REM sleep leads to reduction of airways (further worsened in REM sleep due to skeletal muscle paralysis/reductions in Respiratory Activity).
- Blood O‚ÇÇ levels ‚Üì (hypoxia) and
CO‚ÇÇ levels ‚Üë (hypercapnia), waking the patient.
- Obstructive sleep apnoea/Snoring: Excessive relaxation of pharyngeal muscles occluding airways, especially in overweight men.
- Both forms of apnoea lead to insomnia and sleepiness during normal waking periods.
- In severe cases, there is intellectual impairment, possibly due to loss of REM sleep.

### Narcolepsy

- Activity of hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin neurons promote wakefulness.
- Narcolepsy: excessive daytime sleepiness, causing bursts of sleeping during wakeful periods (Px cannot stay awake for extended periods).
- There may be attacks of REM sleep with cataplexy (muscular paralysis).
- Narcoleptics have < 10% of hypothalamic hypocretin neurons, reducing excitation of the Ascending Activating System.

### Encephalitis Lethargica

- Around 1917, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica spread across Europe, causing long periods of sleep and increased feelings of sleepiness.
- Von Economo found that most patients had inflammation or lesions of the posterior hypothalamus.
- The affected areas included the Tubero- mammillary nucleus, location of Histaminergic neurons which stimulate the Ascending Activating System.

# Brain Injury and Consciousness

- There are 2 components to consciousness:
1. Being awake/alert: depends upon reticular activating system.
2. Being aware: depends upon cerebral cortex to allow for Cortical Processing.
- A blow to head can produce concussion (a short loss of consciousness).
- Detailed mechanisms unknown, but it is likely due to some sort of brain shock or changes in extracellular [K‚Å∫].
- More severe injury involving some brain swelling, vascular or neuronal damage produces a coma, of varying severity and duration.
- Degree of coma is assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale, that depends upon eye opening, verbal and motor responses.
- For the cerebral cortex, only very large, usually bilateral lesions produce coma.
- But small regions of thalamus or reticular formation modulate activity in large areas of cortex via the Ascending Activating System, so coma can result from small lesions in these structures, where the Nuclei of the Ascending Activating System are found.
- Cerebral cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus lie in anterior cranial fossa.
- Brainstem lies in posterior cranial fossa.
- Brainstem connections to thalamus and cortex must pass through tentorial notch that circles brainstem and forms the roof of the Posterior Cranial Fossa.
- A slowly developing, space occupying supratentorial lesion compresses ventricles and blood flow is reduced.
- There are graded signs of coma.
- Pressure from this lesion is transmitted to brainstem causes vomiting by activating emetic centres.
- Finally, if the Lesion progresses significantly, Brainstem respiratory and cardiovascular centres are depressed, followed by death.
- Early intervention can be successful.
- Lesions of infratentorial region usually produce obvious cranial nerve signs, but not cardiovascular effects.
- Loss of ascending activating inputs then produce sudden coma without preceding signs of confusion and stupor.
- Prognosis often poor.

# Brain Seizures

- Brain Seizures = Prolonged synchronous discharge of large numbers of neurons.
- Epilepsy: Involves seizure events that may occur frequently throughout life.
- Partial seizures: involve limited brain regions and may produce sensory or motor disturbances.
- Hippocampal involvement can produce d√©j√† vu or unfamiliarity.
- General seizures: involve whole brain, with fast onset.
- Absence seizures: loss of awareness, maintained muscle tone. EEG has 3 Hz spike-wave complex (Relatively Broad 3 Hz with a Central Sharp Spike).
- Time and memory loss occurs during the seizure period but is usually minor.
- Tonic-clonic seizures: loss of consciousness, all muscles contract, breathing stops (tonic phase of 1 min).
- Then rhythmic muscle jerking (clonic phase for 1 min) when injuries may occur.
- Significant Time and memory loss occurs during the seizure period.
