# [076] Workshop - Brain Scans

# Plain Radiography (X-Ray)

- Physical Basis =  X-Ray
- Tissue Characteristics: Bone/metal/dense structures are radio-opaque = white. Less dense material = darker. Air/gas = black.
- Poor soft tissue differentiation (E.g Brain).
- Uses: Still useful for bony injury
to skull and spine (1st line).
- Superseded by newer cross -
sectional techniques.

# Computed Tomography (CT)

- Physical Basis = Rotating X-ray beam & detectors located circumferentially around body, information used in computer 2D reconstruction of image based on attenuation characteristics
- Tomography = method of producing images of a plane.
- Uses = 1st cross-sectional test for CNS
- Tissue Characteristics
- Good soft tissue differentiation.
- Bone/metal/radio-opaque structures have very high “attenuation” (= high density) = white.
- Air & fat have very low attenuation = black.
- Water & CSF have low attenuation = dark.
- Acute haematoma (blood) high attenuation = light.
- Use of Intravenous Contrast: enhancement (high attenuation) of Brain regions (appears white) due to
1. Increased vascularity.
2. Breakdown of the Blood-Brain-Barrier.
- When looking at CT of Brain, Identify midline/falx cerebri to see if there is Midline Shift and to check symmetry
- Septum Pellucidum runs from the Anterior region of the Corpus Callosum anteriorly to the Fornix posteriorly
- Corpus Callosum can be seen anterior to the Lateral Ventricle, running horizontally across the midline
- Fornix is found posterior to the Lateral Ventricle
- Head of the Caudate Nucleus bulges into the Anterior Horn of the Lateral Ventricle

- Cavernous Sinus (Containing ICA) is found lateral to the Sella Turcica bilaterally
- Basilar Artery is not found superior to the Pons
- Gyrus Rectus is found just lateral to the Midline, in the frontal lobe in an inferior cross-section of the Brain

- Free Margin of Tentorium Cerebelli is attached to Anterior Clinoid Process and Fixed Margin of Tentorium Cerebelli is attached to the Posterior Clinoid Process
- Calcification in the Pineal Gland and Choroid Plexi of the Lateral Ventricle (Appear Hyperintense/White) is a normal finding on a CT

# MRI

- Physical Basis = Cross - sectional images like CT BUT completely different physical foundation.
- No ionising radiation.
- Based on signals derived from protons associated with tissue water and fat.
- In a very strong magnetic field, spinning hydrogen protons align with the external magnetic field, and return to
equilibrium at varying rates depending on the tissue structure.
- “Time constants” T1 & T2 give different intensity signals for various tissues.
- In T (2) tWo Water is White & CSF is very watery
- Uses =
- Gold standard neuroimaging technique
- Excellent soft tissue definition
- Images in any plane
- Limitations =
- CT better for bone
- Pacemakers & ferromagnetic implants contraindicated
- Claustrophobic & noisy
- Not as readily available & more expensive that CT.
- The Circle of Willis is found within the Interpeduncular Cistern of the CSF, anterior to the Midbrain
- CN VII and VIII emerge from the Angle between the Medulla, Pons and Cerebellum (Lower Pons)
- Posterior Limb of Internal Capsule separates Lentiform Nucleus and Thalamus and Anterior Limb of the Internal Capsule separates the Caudate Nucleus from the Putamen
- Cisterna Magna = CSF Space found posterior to the Spinal Cord/Medulla within the Foramen Magnum
- Splenium of the Corpus Callosum is important for connecting the 2 Visual Cortices together
- Anterior Cingulate Gyrus = Control of Micturition and Personality, Posterior Cingulate Gyrus = Memory and Retrosplenial Gyrus = Spacial Memory
- Marginal Portion of the Cingulate Sulcus (Pars Marginalis) is found posterior to the Paracentral Lobule, running Superficially

# Cerebral Angiography

- Physical Basis = X-Ray images taken after contrast injected selectively into
carotid and vertebral arteries
- Performed via retrograde femoral artery catheterisation
- Tissue Characteristics:
- Vessels shown with contrast medium (radio-opaque)
- Uses
- All vascular lesions (Aneurysm, AVM, vascular tumours…)
- Also therapeutic: endovascular embolisation of lesion
- NB invasive with a mortality of 1%
- Carotid Siphon is the C/S shaped region of the ICA that runs through the Cavernous Sinus
- Anterior Cerebral Artery can be identified due to its arcing/looped shape
- Middle Cerebral Artery can be identified as it is found at the Distal tip of the Internal Carotid Artery and is usually enlarged proximally where it arises from the ICA
- Posterior Cerebral Artery can seen as the Inferior Most Cerebral Artery, running Posteriorly, starting Proximally as the Posterior Communicating Artery (connected to the ICA) and continuing Distally as the PCA
- Most of the Blood in the PCA comes from the Basilar Artery vs the ICA
- Lenticulostriatal Arteries can be identified as they emerge at right angles from the Proximal MCA

- Chiari Malformation = Malformation in the Foramen Magnum, causing Brain Tissue to protrude down through the Foramen Magnum into the Spinal Cord
- Syrinx are often associated with Chiari Malformations

- Extradural Haematomas in the Posterior Cranial Fossa are often caused by Venous Bleeds

![Screenshot 2022-01-21 at 15.57.04.png](%5B076%5D%20Workshop%20-%20Brain%20Scans%2075d70a23be98452d9bf89eab441e297f/Screenshot_2022-01-21_at_15.57.04.png)

- These tend to be more extensive, with more diffuse borders than Extradural Haematomas
