# [010] Development of the Brain 2

# Basic Body Plan and Subdivisions of the Brain

### Basic Body Plan

- At end of neurulation, nervous system is divided along the rostral- caudal axis into forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain and spinal cord.
- The Eye is found on the Ventral Margin between the Forebrain and the Midbrain
- Hindbrain is also transiently divided into several segments called rhombomeres (r1-r7) which are continuous with the spinal cord caudally along the dorsal surface of the Embryo.
- r7 is found dorsal to the Rostral Aspect of S1 (Somite 1)
- Caudal to the Rhombomeres are the Somites ventrally and Spinal Cord dorsally

### Subdivisions of the Brain

- The Telencephalon of the Forebrain forms more superficial Forebrain structures whilst the Diencephalon forms more medial/deep structures of the Forebrain

# Subdivisions of the Brain

- The Rostral neural tube undergoes extensive remodelling to form brain.
- Telencephalon (rostral part of forebrain) expands and soon dominates the superior and lateral surfaces of brain.
- This forms the cerebral hemispheres, and covers both diencephalon and mesencephalon.

# Cell Division in the Neural Tube

- The Newly formed neural tube is comprised of a pseudostratified epithelium containing rapidly dividing cells.
- Nuclei migrate to outer surface of the Neural Tube for S-phase (DNA replication) by extending their processes out towards the Outer Surface of the Neural Tube, pulling the Nuclei outwards with them
- After DNA has been replicated,  the Nuclei migrate inwards towards the ventricular/inner surfaces
- This cycle is known as Interkinetic Nuclear Migration
- When the Nuclei are again found near the Ventricular Surface, they retract their cellular processes and complete M-phase/Mitosis before reforming their cellular processes to allow for the Migration of the Nuclei superficially, restarting the cycle.
- At the initial stages of Neural Development, cell divisions are symmetric and produce 2 identical daughter cells that continue to divide to expand the stem cell population of the Neural Tube.
- It is this movement of nuclei between the outer and inner/ventricular surfaces that make it appear as pseudostratified.

# Differentiation of the Neural Tube

- Neuroepithelial cells eventually undergo asymmetric cell divisions, producing a mitotic stem cell and radial glial cells, which divide asymmetrically to form another radial glial cell and a non-mitotic neuroblast which is partially differentiated (i.e. progenitor cell).
- The Production of the Non-Mitotic Neuroblast vs 2 Mitotic Cells slows down the Rate of Proliferation of the Neural Tube Stem Cells to prevent excessive proliferation that can lead to Tumour Formation
- The Mitotic Stem Cell can continue proliferating to maintain the Stem Cell Population of the Neural Tube whilst the Neuroblasts will differentiate produce all neurons in CNS.
- The production of varying Cell types causes the Neural tube to now become stratified into ventricular (mitotic), mantle (neuronal bodies) and marginal (nerve fibres/axons) layers, moving superficially.
- Subsequent round of mitosis produce glioblasts, which form support cells of CNS.
- These Radial glia are able to undergo further rounds of Asymmetric Division near the Ventricular Surface to form differentiated cells of the Nervous System and more Radial Glial Cells that provide pathways/a scaffold for neuroblast migration within neural tube.

- Stem/Ependymal cells are found next to ventricular/innermost layer.
- Differentiated cells are found in mantle layer.

- Neuroblasts and Post-Mitotic Neurons generated in ventricular zone during the Neurogenic Phase of Division migrate laterally to their final locations along the processes of radial glial cells that extend from the Ventricular Surface (Radial Glial Nuclei) to the Outer/Pial Surface found laterally.
- First wave (blue) migrate shortest distance, forming inner most layer of neurons.
- Second wave (green) migrate past earliest neuroblasts, forming the next, more superficial layer of neurons.
- This is repeated until all layers of the CNS (notably in the Cerebral Cortex) have formed.

# Neural Progenitors

- Radial glia are progenitors of all cell types formed by neural tube.
- In progenitor expansion phase, they divide symmetrically, but in subsequent phases, they may divide asymmetrically forming a mitotic radial glia cell and either a neuroblast (during the neurogenic phase) or glioblasts.
- Radial glia eventually differentiates as astrocytes.
- Progenitor expansion phase: stem cells divide.
- Neurogenic phase: Radial Glial divides forming another radial glial cell and a differentiated cell (e.g. neuron).
- Gliogenic phase: progenitor cells form other differentiated support cells of the CNS like Oligodendrocytes, Astrocyte and Ependymal Cells.

# Dorsal-Ventral Organisation

- There are at least 9 distinct layer (I IX) along dorsal-ventral axis of vertebrate spinal cord (Rexed laminae), each containing neurons with specialised functions.
- Layer IX forms both lateral and medial motor-neurons.
- Layer VIII forms motor-interneurons.

# Notochord Induces Floor Plate, Which Induces Motor Neurons

### Notocord Induced Floor Plate

- Later on in the development of the Nervous System (after it has induced the Neural Plate), Notochord (found ventral to the Neural Tube) plays a key role in patterning ventral half of neural tube found just dorsal to the Notochord by inducing floor plate in this region.
- This was demonstrated by grafting a 2nd notochord to the lateral side of neural tube and observing that it induced an ectopic floor plate within the Lateral Neural Tube.
- If notochord removed, then floor plate does not form.

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 07.55.56.png](%5B010%5D%20Development%20of%20the%20Brain%202%20a306dc5d9eb54c759132125838bb75b8/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_07.55.56.png)

### Floor Plate Induces Motor Neurons

- Floor plate is then responsible for establishing different neuronal identities in ventral half of neural tube, found dorsal to the Floor Plate.
- This was demonstrated by grafting a floor plate into lateral side of neural tube and observing that it induced ectopic motor neurons from the Lateral side of the Neural Tube
- Whilst the Notochord and the Floor Plate are involved in specifying the region of the Neural Tube just dorsal to it, Motor Neurons do not specify Sensory Neurons (which are the next most dorsal structure in the Neural Tube after the Motor Neurons) as they do not secrete SHH

# SHH (Notochord Signal)

- SHH is released by notochord and floor plate, which generates a [SHH] gradient down the Ventral-Dorsal Axis, where [SHH] is highest in the Ventral Spinal Cord and lowest in the Dorsal Spinal Cord.
- Where [SHH] is high ventrally, it activates expression of Nkx2.2 in the ventral progenitor/Radial Glial cells, which restricts the lineage of Ventral Progenitor Cells so that they form cells associated with the Ventral Spinal Cord
- This Ventral Nkx2.2 expression restricts Pax6 expression to more dorsal progenitor/radial glial cells, which restricts the lineage of Dorsal Progenitor Cells differently to that seen in the Ventral Cells so that the Dorsal Progenitor Cells can form cells associated with the Dorsal Spinal Cord
- Islet1 is expressed by differentiating motor-neurons, formed by Nkx2.2/Pax6 expressing progenitors found between the Dorsal Pax6 expressing cells and the Ventral Nkx2.2 expressing cells within the developing spinal cord.

# Specifying Neuronal Subtypes in the Spinal Cord

- Studies on chick and mouse embryos have shown that SHH specifies neuronal subtypes in ventral half of neural tube, while BMP (coming from roof plate) specifies neuronal subtypes in dorsal half
- This is specified by a Ventral-Dorsal [SHH] Gradient (High [SHH] Ventrally) and Dorsal-Ventral [BMP] Gradient (High [BMP] Dorsally), which causes Dorsal and Ventral Cells of the Spinal Cord to produce different post-mitotic cell types
- Therefore, Nkx2.2 is expressed in cells surrounded by High [SHH] and low [BMP] whilst Pax6 is expressed in cells surrounded by Low [SHH] and High [BMP]

# Holoprosencephaly and SHH

- SHH is also critical for the development of more Rostral Structures within the Forebrain
- Holoprosencephaly is a condition that affects 1 in 250 pregnancies, with only 3% of cases coming to term.
- In most severe cases, forebrain fails to divide into the 2 cerebral hemispheres, while less severe cases (milder mutations) have near-normal brains but facial deformities that may affect eyes, nose and upper lip.
- Mutations affecting SHH signalling have been shown to be a cause of this condition.

# Developing Axon and Growth Cone

- After the Post-Mitotic Neurons have formed, the axon growing out from a neuron cell body ends in a large, motile structure called growth cone.
- The Growth Cone is a very dynamic region of the Neuron, with many filopodia/extensions are continually extended and retracted from growth cone to explore the surrounding mesenchyme in which the Neuron is growing, searching for cues/signals that can direct axon growth to allow neuronal circuits to form.
- If the Filopodia detects a growth signal that can direct axonal growth, then the Filopodia is stabilised and the axon projects down the Filopodia to form Axonal Connections
- If the Filopodia does not detect a growth signal, the Filopodia regresses back into the growth cone
- Over time, this causes the growth cone to eventually grow towards the growth signal to reach its next target to form synapses
- The Stabilisation of the Filopodia in the presence of the Growth Factor occurs as Filopodia contain multiple actin filaments and if the Actin filaments are stabilised via Actin Polymerisation by the Growth Factor, the Filopodia is stabilise and does not regress whereas if the Actin Filament is not stabilised, the Filopodia will be destabilise and will regress

# Axonal Guidance

- 4 types of mechanism contribute to controlling direction that a growth cone moves.
- Attractant molecules can either be present as a diffusible gradient (chemoattraction) or bound to substratum (contact attraction) and stabilise the Polymerisation of the Actin Filaments of the Filopodia and hence, the Filopodia projecting towards these Molecules, causing these Filopodia to persist.
- Contract Attraction/Repulsion occurs when the Axon is in direct contract with surrounding tissue/cells whereas Chemoattraction/Repulsion occurs when the Axon is freely within the ECM (not in contact with cells)
- Similarly, molecules that repel axon growth can either be diffusible (chemorepulsion) or bound (contact repulsion) and destabilise the Polymerisation of the Actin Filaments of the Filopodia projecting towards these molecules, causing filopodia to regress here.

# Segmentation of Spinal Nerves and the Nervous System

### Spinal Nerves

- Axons from motor-neurons exit the spinal cord via ventral roots but will only migrate through anterior regions of adjacent somites (found lateral to the Spinal Cord).
- Cells of posterior region of the somite express a protein (Ephrin), a contact repellent on axons which destabilises Actin Polymerisation within Growth Cone Filopodia Here.
- This is responsible for segmental pattern of spinal nerves as causes the Growth Cone of Motor Neurons to project away from the Posterior Region of the Somite and through the Anterior Region of the Somite , causing them to exit ventrally through the somite and spinal cord.

![Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 08.03.10.png](%5B010%5D%20Development%20of%20the%20Brain%202%20a306dc5d9eb54c759132125838bb75b8/Screenshot_2021-11-18_at_08.03.10.png)

### Nervous System

- Motor axons leaving neural tube form a ventral root, which joins with fibres to dorsal root ganglion, to form a spinal nerve.
- Both motor axons and Dorsal Root Ganglia are repeated segmentally down the Spinal Cord because they are excluded from posterior region of each somite.

# Commissural Axons Project to Ventral Midline of Neural Tube

- Commissural neurons are found in dorsal half of spinal cord and receive general sensory signals such as pain, heat or cold.
- Their axons project towards the floor, decussate and then project rostrally/superiorly to the brain
- Repellents from roof plate (BMP) (Which Induce the Dorsal Spinal Cord earlier on in development) and attractants from floor plate (Netrin predominantly but also SHH - The Latter of which induces the Ventral Spinal Cord earlier on in development) establish a Ventral Dorsal [Netrin] and a Dorsal-Ventral [BMP] which are both responsible for the directional movement of Commissural Axons towards the Floor Plate, found along the Ventral Midline of the Spinal Cord.
- Many factors involved in processes of early embryological development (E.g BMP and SHH) are also involved in later stages of development in the same region, but carry out a different purpose here due to stimulation of different receptors at different developmental stages
- Once these commissural Neurons reach and cross the floor plate, they are no longer attracted by Netrin and SHH from the Floor Plate so that they can decussate and innervate the contralateral side

# Netrin Attracts Commissural Axons

- In absence of Netrin-1, most commissural axons do not migrate to floor plate (some project ventrally but this seems to be random) and fail to cross midline.
