# How to Assess T3 and T4

- T4 is primary hormone secreted by thyroid gland.
- 80% of serum T3 results from peripheral conversion of T4 via 5’- mono-deiodination in various tissues to allow for tight control of tissue specific metabolism.
- Nearly all THs circulate in bloodstream bound to plasma proteins where they are non-biologically active, and only 0.02% of T4 and 0.2% of T3 circulate in free form.
- FT4 and FT3 levels are more relevant than total hormone levels.
- Free hormone is biologically active form of hormone.
- Various acquired or inherited changes in transporter proteins alter TT4 and TT3 (total levels) serum levels, with different Thyroid Hormone Transporters being more selective for T3 or T4 transport.
- TSH and FT4 are routinely used to assess thyroid function and to monitory hyper- and hypothyroidism treatment.
- FT4 is not susceptible and hence, doesn’t change much due to changes in expression of TH transporters and has little intra-individual variability.
- TT4 should be measured when discrepancies exist.
- T3 levels alone are not appropriate for diagnosing hypothyroidism because ↑ conversion of T4 → T3 maintains T3 serum levels within normal range until hypothyroidism becomes severe.
- T3 testing, combined with an interpretation of FT4 levels is useful for diagnosing and monitoring hyperthyroidism for following
reasons:
1. High TT3/TT4 ratio (>20) suggests Graves’ disease.
2. T3 levels are useful for monitoring acute response to thyrotoxicosis treatment in Graves’ disease, elevated T3 is a common early sign of relapse.

# Immunoassay

- 𝐻 + 𝐴𝑏 ⇌ 𝐻. 𝐴𝑏
- Antibody binds to hormone, in a usually reversible manner, with the HAb complex which can be detected and hence, quantify Hormone Levels.
- These assays are very sensitive (can detect picomolar/10⁻¹² M concentrations) due to high affinity of antibody for antigen.
- As a result, only, a small serum sample is required (10 𝜇𝐿).
- Highly specific for different hormones and can distinguish between hormones with very similar structures (E.g T3/4 and Different Steroids) due to the use of Highly Specific mAb which are highly specified to their Ag.
- Very precise: simple steps with micropipettes and responses measured with instruments capable of highly reproducible quantitative/signal measurements (e.g. radioactive counters, spectrophotometers).
- High sample throughputs: simple steps with specially designed equipment to allow for rapid processing of different samples (e.g. microtiter plates for ELISAs, with 96 optical densities being read in 20s).
- Very cheap: reagents required are inexpensive and used at high dilutions.
- In UK, they are used in highly developed quality control systems, with monthly checks on all immunoassay labs to minimise variability across different labs.
- T4 is measured across UK with as little as 10% variance.
- Method (immunometric assay): test tube lined with anti-hormone antibodies.
- Known amount of Hormone is added and is incubated to allow the Hormone to bind to antibodies.
- Quantification of Amount of Hormone Bound to Ab can be done using a ‘Sandwich’ Assay using Radioactive or Enzyme Labelled mAbs or Competitive Binding Assay using Radiolabeled and Standard/Unlabeled Hormone
- Test tube is then washed to remove excess hormones and radioactive antibodies.
- Carry out with different known concentrations of hormone to produce a Standard Curve which can be used to predict unknown [Hormone] from a Px sample based on a given Radioactivity measurement

# Immunometric Assays (For Larger Hormones With a M.Wt > 1000)

- Immunoassay = Immunometric Assay
- Name is changed according to label used for 2nd antibody: immunoradiometric assay (radiation) or
immunocolorimetric assay (toxic, cause
foetal abnormalities).
- An excess of a radiolabelled antibody is added, which forms a ‘sandwich’ with original antibody-hormone complex, radioactivity is then measured from triple complex to determine concentration of hormone present.
- ELISA works in same way but uses enzyme-linked Ab that converts a colourless reagent into a coloured product rather than producing radioactivity when bound to the Substrate/Hormone.
- This is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
- Results of an immunometric assay are compared against a standard curve so that colour/radioactivity seen can be converted into a hormone concentration.
- These assays can only be done for hormones with a MR>1,000 as in Smaller Hormones, there is not enough surface area for 2 binding sites to be present to allow 2 Ab to simultaneously bind to the Hormone
- For smaller hormones, use a different method.

# Competitive Binding Immunoassays (For Smaller Hormones with a M.Wt < 1000)

- Used for hormones with molecular weight <1,000 (E.g T3/4 and All Steroids).
- This uses a Anti-Hormone Ab bound to the Inside of the Tube, Constant amount of Radiolabeled Hormone and Unknown amount amount of Normal Hormone
- Known amounts of Radiolabeled and unlabeled Hormone are added to a test tube coated with Anti-Hormone Ab
- This test tube is allowed to incubate and then washed out to remove unbound hormone
- Radioactivity within the test tube is then measured and this process is repeated for varying concentrations of the Unlabeled hormone to produce a standard curve of Radioactivity against Standard/Unlabeled Hormone Concentration
- This works by competition between a constant amount of radiolabelled hormone and a variable amount of unlabelled hormone for a limited amount of antibody.
- As unlabelled hormone increases, it more effectively competes with the constant amount of Radiolabeled Hormone in binding to the Antihormone Ab
- This means that as more Unlabelled Hormone is added, more unlabeled Hormone is bound to the Ab and less radiolabled hormone is bound, causing radioactivity ↓.
- The level of radioactivity produced when a patient sample is added is compared to standard curve to determine the hormone concentration in the Px sample.
