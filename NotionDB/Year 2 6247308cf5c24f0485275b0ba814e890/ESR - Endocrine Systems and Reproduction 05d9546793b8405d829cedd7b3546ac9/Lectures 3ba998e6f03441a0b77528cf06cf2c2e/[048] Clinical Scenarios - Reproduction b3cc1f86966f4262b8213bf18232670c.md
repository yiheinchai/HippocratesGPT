- This is different to abortion as Conception begins with Fertilisation but is not complete until implantation so any method which prevents implantation is not the same as inducing a miscarriage/abortion
- Fertile Window = Period of Time coinciding with LH Surge where Ovulation commonly occurs (Usually half way through cycle)
- Chance of Conceiving around the time of ovulation are around 20%
- IUD - Most effective form with lowest failure rate
- Levonelle/Progesterone Pill - Used within first 120 hours
- Ella One/Ulipristal Acetate - Only can be used within 72 hours
