# [008] Pathophysiology of Diabetes Mellitus

Progress: Not started

# Histological Changes in Diabetic Pancreas

- Common Shifting Pattern seen along this spectrum = Early Stages, Px Present with More Insulin Resistance, leading to Hyperinsulinaemia in an attempt to maintain normal Insulin Signalling and hence, Normoglycaemia
- Monogenic Diabetes are caused by Defects in the Insulin Secretory Mechanism or Beta Cell Failure, producing a Phenotype Similar to B Cell Failure
- This puts increased strain on Beta Cells, exacerbating Beta Cell Failure, causing later stages to present with more Significant Beta Cell Failure in addition

- In T1DM, autoimmune reaction
against ùõΩ cells leads to infiltration of
pancreatic islet by T cells which eventually destroys gland
- This arises due to a Genetic Disposition (Often HLA) and an environmental Insult due to Viral Infection (Molecular Mimicry), Damage of Beta Cells or Drugs (Checkpoint Inhibitors)

- In T2DM, pancreatic islet is not
usually affected or enlarged.
- In some patients with long-standing diabetes, there are amyloid deposits  (fibres of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP)).

# Lack of Insulin in Type I Diabetes Mellitus and Plasma [Glucose] in Diabetics and Non-Diabetics

### Lack of Insulin in T1DM

- Lack of Insulin reduces Glucose transport and utilisation, leading to ‚Üë glucose.
- Lack of insulin means unopposed ‚Üë glucagon.
- ‚Üë protein breakdown, which leads to ‚Üë glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose output.
- There is also ‚Üë lipolysis, ketogenesis.
- Patient becomes catabolic (Muscle wasting), dehydrated (because of polyuria as a result of Hyperglycaemia) and there is progressive deterioration (decompensation, diabetic ketoacidosis and coma).

### Plasma [Glucose] in Diabetics and Non-Diabetics

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 16.18.08.png](%5B008%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20Diabetes%20Mellitus%2040dea5c561904db1b00ceeb016a0b9fe/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_16.18.08.png)

### Metabolic Disturbance in T1DM

- In Diabetics, Fasting [Glucose] is raised due to unopposed Glucagon activity due to reduced [Insulin] and greater fluctuations/peaks are seen in Glucose following Meals as Less Insulin secretions means there is reduced Insulin Signalling to restore Normoglycaemia
- Ketone bodies are acidic, and they cause ketoacidosis, which can cause brain to fail.

# Type II Diabetes Mellitus

- Progressive metabolic disorder characterised by ùõΩ cell malfunction and insulin resistance.
- It is a complex metabolic disorder involving other Cardiovascular Dysfunction - impaired insulin secretion, insulin resistance, microvascular complications, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, central obesity, macrovascular complications (Atherosclerosis),
impaired insulin secretion.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 16.19.11.png](%5B008%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20Diabetes%20Mellitus%2040dea5c561904db1b00ceeb016a0b9fe/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_16.19.11.png)

### Insulin Resistance

- In T2DM, Hyperglycaemia is seen with Hyperinsulinaemia
- In T1DM, Hyperglycaemia is seen with Hypoinsulinaemia
- This appears to be multifactorial in cause
- As one gains Weight, there is an Increase in Central Obesity/Visceral Adipose Tissue and other Viscera, triggering Inflammation
- This Inflammation is further enhanced by Viral Infection, Ageing and Hyperglycaemia
- Therefore, Increasing Insulin Resistance is likely to be a stress response to Inflammation, putting increased Stress on the Pancreas to Increase Insulin production to maintain Normoglycaemia, causing Beta Cell Failure, which exacerbates Hyperglycaemia and Insulin Resistance in a Positive Feedback Cycle

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 16.19.44.png](%5B008%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20Diabetes%20Mellitus%2040dea5c561904db1b00ceeb016a0b9fe/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_16.19.44.png)

### Pathogenesis of T2DM

1. Environmental Factors like Central/Visceral Organ Obesity, Inflammation and Hormones (E.g Glucocorticoids) when combined with Genetic Predisposition (Polygenic) ‚Üí There is a strong genetic link for T2DM
2. These Genetic Factors influence Insulin Resistance and Beta Cell Function which compromise Insulin Receptor Activity and Secretion to Produce Hyperglycaemia

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 16.20.14.png](%5B008%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20Diabetes%20Mellitus%2040dea5c561904db1b00ceeb016a0b9fe/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_16.20.14.png)

### Interaction of Genes, Obesity and the Environment

- Genes responsible for obesity and insulin resistance interact with environmental factors (‚Üë fat/caloric intake and ‚Üì physical activity), resulting in development of obesity and insulin resistance.
- These ‚Üë secretory demand on Œ≤-cells.
- If Œ≤-cells are normal, their function and mass ‚Üë in response to this ‚Üë secretory demand, leading to compensatory hyperinsulinaemia and maintenance of normal glucose tolerance.
- By contrast, susceptible Œ≤-cells have a genetically determined risk, and combination of ‚Üë secretory demand and detrimental environment result in Œ≤-cell dysfunction and ‚Üì Œ≤-cell mass, resulting in progression to impaired glucose
tolerance, followed, ultimately, by development of type 2 diabetes.

# ùú∑ Cell Proliferation and Dysfunctional Adipose Tissue

### ùú∑ Cell Proliferation

- Response of ùõΩ-cell mass to insulin resistance.
- In people who can compensate for insulin resistance by stimulating ùõΩ-cell proliferation to raise Insulin Signalling back to normal levels  to maintain Normoglycaemia, they will not develop T2DM.
- If ability of ùõΩ cells to proliferate ‚Üì or there is greater ùõΩ cell Death than growth, then there can be early development of T2DM due to Beta Cell Dysfunction, reducing Insulin Signalling and therefore, the ability to maintain Normoglycaemia

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 16.23.54.png](%5B008%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20Diabetes%20Mellitus%2040dea5c561904db1b00ceeb016a0b9fe/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_16.23.54.png)

### Dysfunctional Adipose Tissue

- Type 2 diabetics: adipose tissue ectopically deposits in liver and muscles.
- This ectopic adipose tissue is dysfunctional and is more inflammatory.
- This leads to release of cytokines such as TNF, IL-6 and MCP-1 and causes necrosis of Adipocytes, invasion by macrophages and chronic inflammation
- Chronic Inflammation then triggers Insulin Resistance, which then leads to Beta Cell Dysfunction
- Normal glucose tolerant obese patients: fat is less inflammatory as adipose tissue tends to be outside viscera in subcutaneous tissues vs Visceral Adipose Depots ‚Üí Far less development of T2DM

---

# Complex Situation and Complications

### Complex Situation

- Individual patients have a complex mix of:
1. Genetic predisposition to obesity.
2. Epigenetic predisposition (foetal programming).
3. Differing abilities to compensate:
- ùõΩ-cell proliferation.
- Adipose tissue inflammatory response.
- Tendency to become insulin resistant.
1. Different environmental exposures:
- Diet and activity.
- Intercurrent illness (stress).
- Exposure to drugs (steroids).
- Access to healthcare

### Complications

- ‚Üë incidence of CVD ‚Üí Number 1 Killer.
- Peripheral vascular disease.
- Renal disease (microangiopathy).
- Retinal disease (microangiopathy).
- Lens opacity (cataracts).
- Neuropathy (impaired nerve conductance).
1. Autonomic (bladder, stomach, blood vessels, erections).
2. Sensory
3. Motor
- Skin infections (gangrene, thrush and other yeasts).
- Osteoarthritis
- Most of the complications are vascular based

# Glycation of Proteins in Hyperglycaemia

- Glucose is a reactive chemical due to its -OH Groups which can bonds with amines within the Protein to form Schiff base in a reversible reaction.
- Chemical rearrangement (Amadori rearrangement) can convert Schiff base into a permanent/irreversible bond which is known as an Advanced glycosylation end-product (AGE).
- This can be exploited as a diagnostic tool for diabetes as glycated haemoglobin can be separated by electrophoresis or chromatography and area under curve for HbA1c Signal is compared to that under the HbA2 Signal to determine the percentage of HbA1c out of all HbA2 in the blood.
- This reflects average glycaemia over past 90 days (RBC Life = 90-120 Days).

# Increased Glucose and Lipids Leads to AGE Effects

- AGEs Triggers inflammation
- Hyperglycaemia and Hyperlipidaemia can also increase Oxidative Stress and activate the RAAS independent of AGE formation
- RAAS Activation and Inflammation trigger fibrosis within Vasculature leading to Nephropathy, Retinopathy and Neuropathy (Microvascular Disease) and Atherosclerosis (Macrovascular Diseases)

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 16.27.57.png](%5B008%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20Diabetes%20Mellitus%2040dea5c561904db1b00ceeb016a0b9fe/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_16.27.57.png)

- Superoxide Dismutase/SOD removes free radicals within cells and is very sensitive to Glycation
- Glycation of SOD inhibits its activity, leading to the accumulation of ROS, which gives rise to Oxidative Stress

![Screenshot 2022-01-25 at 16.53.48.png](%5B008%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20Diabetes%20Mellitus%2040dea5c561904db1b00ceeb016a0b9fe/Screenshot_2022-01-25_at_16.53.48.png)

# Glycosylation of SOD (Superoxide Dismutase) Inhibits its Activity

- Oxidative stress can lead to inflammatory biomarkers which leads to malfunction of various metabolic pathways, which overall leads to insulin resistance and ùõΩ-cell dysfunction.
- Oxidative Stress activates downstream signalling mechanisms, which increases AGE, Sorbitol, PKC Signalling (All of which increase Insulin Resistance) and increased Production of Cytokines and Prostanoids (Leading to Beta Cell Dysfunction)
- Therefore, Defects in Insulin Signalling in T2DM cause Hyperglycaemia, which worsen Insulin Resistance and Beta Cell Dysfunction, establishing a Positive Feedback Cycle

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 16.28.56.png](%5B008%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20Diabetes%20Mellitus%2040dea5c561904db1b00ceeb016a0b9fe/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_16.28.56.png)

# Sorbitol Pathway

- When glucose levels are high, sorbitol and fructose accumulate in cells since they diffuse relatively slowly and are difficult to metabolise.
- These are highly soluble and cause osmotic effects by increasing cytoplasmic tonicitiy, mediating Osmotic water influx which may damage cells such as lens cells (can cause Catatracts) and nerve cells.
- Sorbitol is an intermediate of glucose being converted to fructose.
- It is a non-absorbed sugar which has osmotic effects.

# How Changes Lead to Diabetes Complications

| Retinopathy | Glycation of Basement Membrane, Exudation and Bleeding |
| --- | --- |
| Cataracts | Accumulation of Sorbitol and Polyols in Lens |
| Neuropathy | Glycation of BM, Blood Supply to Nerves Blocked |
| Nephropathy | Glycation of BM, Leakage of Protein |
| Skin Infections | Poor Blood Supply lead to poor healing, High Glucose Levels encourage pathogenic growth |

---

# Nephropathy

- Key target is glomerulus which functions to retain proteins.
- Damage to the Basement Membrane in Glomerular Capillaries leads to thickening of the Basement Membrane and ‚Üë permeability (vessels become more porous) to blood proteins leads to proteinuria and albuminuria.
- This leads to end stage diabetic nephropathy with excessive scarring
- External surface is granular reflecting extensive sclerosis of cortical glomeruli
- Cut surface shows destruction of renal papillae and scarring consistent with previous attacks of pyelonephritis due to Glycosuria.

![Screenshot 2022-01-25 at 17.02.24.png](%5B008%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20Diabetes%20Mellitus%2040dea5c561904db1b00ceeb016a0b9fe/Screenshot_2022-01-25_at_17.02.24.png)

- There is damage to basement membrane and the mesangium, leading to accumulation of mesangial matrix and thickening of the Basement Membrane.
- Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules (Focal/Nodular Glomerulosclerosis) can be seen ‚Üí These are Dark Purple, relatively anucleate masses (yellow arrows).

# Diabetic Retinopathy

- Damaging basement membrane of capillaries causes the basement membrane to become thickened and porous/more permeable, causing it to leak and form yellow, proteinaceous deposits in eye (Hard Exudates).
- When there is significant thickening of Blood Vessels supplying the Retina, Retinal Arteries can be occluded, producing small patches of Retinal Infarcts (Cotton Wool Spot)
- In response to Retinal Ischaemia, Hypoxic Response is stimulated in Ischaemic Cells, causing VEGF release, triggering Neovascularisation
- These newly formed blood vessels are very fragile and have a tendency to bleed, causing haemorrhage.
- If Exudates, Neovascularisation or Haemorrhage occur on the Macula, there is affected Macular Vision, causing loss of high acuity central vision

# Foot Infections

- High levels of glucose make a rich medium for organisms infecting skin.
- This growth permissive environment is contributed to by damage to small blood vessels, causing reduced circulation in. the feet.
- Sensory neuropathy leads to foot numbness and damage (e.g. from ill-fitting shoes).
- Can lead to ulceration of skin (commonly on pressure sites/1st Metatarsal head or balls of the feet), within which infections can occur.
- Ulceration on Pressure Areas occurs as Sensory Neuropathy means there is no pressure sensation in the feet, causing Px to place pressure on one region of the foot for extended periods of time, forming an Ulcer due to Ischaemia of Vessels supplying the compressed area
- Reduced Blood Flow to the Foot due to Diabetes results in poor wound healing, causing Ulcers to persist or progress, sometimes leading to surgical or auto amputation via Gangrene

---

# Increased Risk of CVD

- ‚Üë risk of CVD in patients with diabetes than in those without, similar in risk to someone who has already had a previous Hx of CVD.
- Up to 80% of people with diabetes will die from CVD.
- CVD deaths are potentially preventable if action is taken to address known risk factors.
- The risk of Complications occurring increases as Hyperglycaemia/HbA1c increases, more significantly in Microvascular than Macrovascular Disease

---

# Diabetes and Atherosclerosis

1. High glucose ‚Üë ROS, oxidises LDLs, ‚Üë AGEs and increased angiotensin.
2. Causes inflammation of intima media of blood vessels.
3. Macrophages are activated and take up Oxidised LDLs and cholesterols forming foam cells.
4. T-cells and macrophages produce cytokines causing proliferation of fibroblasts and formation of atherosclerotic plaque.
5. Plaques centrally can cause Carotid Stenosis, Cerebral Artery Stenosis or Coronary Heart Disease
6. Plaques in peripheral vessels cause peripheral vascular disease
- Impaired endothelial function - ‚Üì NO production.
- Modification of lipoproteins:
1. LDL particles oxidised/ glycated.
2. Macrophages have receptors for AGE.
3. Take up modified LDL to form foam cells
- Proliferation of smooth muscle cells:
1. Macrophage activation
2. Chemokine release

# Reduced HbA1c Reduces Complication Risk

- ‚Üì HbA1c by 1% significantly ‚Üì risk of: diabetes-related death, MI, microvascular complications, peripheral vascular disease.
- Normal HbA1c of < 6.5% (> 48 mmol/mol) is difficult to achieve
without causing hypoglycaemia and is associated with ‚Üë mortality.
- Aim for 6.5-7.5% (48-59 mmol/mol).
- Quality of life is paramount.
