# Ovary - Non-Pregnant

### Very Low Power

- The largest, more mature follicles lie near the surface of the ovary as they
approach ovulation.
- Follicles may not always contain an Oocyte in the section if the Plane does not pass through the Oocyte
- Numerous oocytes can be seen in the densely cellular ovarian stroma
- The medulla of the ovary is an ill-defined central region near the hilum containing the major ovarian blood vessels in loose connective tissue
- The Ovarian Hilum connects the Ovary to the Broad Ligament
- The surface of the ovary is smooth (except where the mesovarium is attached at the hilum - not shown)
- Secondary Follicles contain:
1. Fuzzy protein precipitate of the follicular fluid in the antrum
2. Oocyte embedded in the stratified cuboidal follicular epithelium (granulosa cells)
3. Ill-defined theca surrounding the follicular epithelium
- Many Secondary Follicles are likely to be present within the Ovary in order to maintain Sufficient Oestrogen and Progesterone levels in the wider body to drive Follicular and Endometrial Growth
- Atretic follicles can be seen, with disintegration of the follicular epithelium and proliferation of theca interna cells being present.

### Low Power

- Ovarian Cortex contains Primordia, Primary and Secondary/Antral Follicles moving deep
- Primordial Follicles can be visualised as very small, pale staining dots just deep to the Ovarian Epithelium, with an even smaller primary Oocyte.
- They are covered by a single Flattened layer of cells
- Graafian follicles are always towards the cortex and bulge beneath the ovarian epithelium (whose cells flatten)

![Ova9401.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Ova9401.jpg)

- The left side of this image is ovarian medulla, which is very vascular (much more than the cortex).
- The Stroma of the Medulla is less cellular and contains more artefacts
- Regions of Light Pink Scar Tissue within Larger White stained circular regions in the Medulla are Corpora Albicantia
- Note also the number of atretic follicles - These are the remains of the secondary follicles that have not gone onto ovulation (do not form the Graafian Follicle)
- The follicles that began to mature in a menstrual cycle but which did not become the Graafian follicle undergo atresia
    
    ![Ova9410.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Ova9410.jpg)
    

### High Power

- Ovarian epithelium: The cortical surface is smooth, covered with a simple cuboidal epithelium (E), often only patchily preserved.
- Deep to the epithelium is a layer of fibrous connective tissue, the tunica albuginea (TA) (be careful of the anatomical context as the testis also has a tunica albuginea)
- Primordial follicles (PF) consist of primary oocytes (O) surrounded by a single layer of flattened follicular cells (F).
- In this image there is a single early primary follicle whose follicular cells have multiplied and have become cuboidal granulosa cells (GC).

![Ova9403.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Ova9403.jpg)

- In Primary Follicles:
1. Primary oocyte (O) has enlarged
2. Granulosa cells have multiplied mitotically and formed a zona granulosa (ZG) between the Theca Folliculi and the Primary Oocyte
3. Ovarian stromal cells have begun to organise themselves around the follicle, forming the theca folliculi (TF)

![Ova9405.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Ova9405.jpg)

- The main difference between a primary follicle and a secondary follicle is the development of the fluid filled antrum (A), which is filled with follicular fluid, due to proliferation of the granulosa cells.
- The granulosa cells become endocrine at this stage, secreting follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and converting androstendione (secreted by thecal cells) into oestrogen.
- The pituitary gland secretes far more FSH than the granulosa cells, whose output is very low.
- The zona pellucida (ZP), which is present in late primary follicles, is well developed, surrounding the oocyte and separating it from the granulosa cells
- The theca folliculi differentiates into the theca interna (TI) and the less distinct theca externa (TE)
- The cells of the theca interna tend to round up and form a layer a few cells thick, with round nuclei.
- These are endocrine cells, they secrete oestrogen and progesterone to promote
proliferation of the uterine mucosa, preparing it for implantation of a fertilised ovum.
- The cells of the theca externa become flat and fusiform, merging with the stroma.

### Medium Power

- Antral follicle at a late stage:
1. The antrum has enlarged, surrounded by an even layer of zona granulosa a few cells thick
2. The region where the granulosa cells maintain the attachment of the oocyte is the cumulus oophorus

![Ova9408.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Ova9408.jpg)

# Pregnant Human Ovary

### Very Low Power

- Corpus luteum of pregnancy occupies about two thirds of the volume of the ovary, causing the ovaries to Hypertrophy.
- Secondary follicles (S) are relatively small and collapsed
- The prominent theca of the secondary follicles is a feature of pregnancy
- Strands of theca lutein (TL) cells (fairly small cells) may be seen penetrating from the periphery into the main mass of follicular lutein cells (large and vacuolated).
- The central cavity of the corpus luteum (persisting from the ovulated secondary follicle) contains a fuzz of protein precipitate and loose connective tissue, formed by invading thecal connective tissue cells.
- Hilum and Broad Ligament contain large blood vessels which are branches of the ovarian and uterine arteries (which
branch off the aorta).
- Ovarian stroma is full of small blood vessels, especially capillaries surrounding follicles - There will also be veins and lymph vessels here.

# Fallopian Tube/Ampulla

### Very Low Power

- It has an extensively folded mucosa
- There is a smooth muscle layer that surrounds the Mucosa with contains intermingled bundles of Circular and Longitudinal Muscle
- There are numerous, very large blood vessels in adventitia and small nerves

![Fal9600.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Fal9600.jpg)

### Low Power

- Layers are:
- Adventitia
- Muscularis propria
- Mucosa (Lamina propria + Epithelium)

![Fal9601.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Fal9601.jpg)

### Medium Power

- Epithelium is ciliated and has variable appearance, containing simple or pseudostratified epithelial cells with basal cells that are cuboidal or columnar
- The Epithelium contains ciliated, non-ciliated and intercalated cells
- Non-Cililary Cells secrete Fallopian Tube fluid that suspends the Zygote/Ovum as it travels towards the Uterus

![Fal9603.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Fal9603.jpg)

# Human Uterus Promenstrual

### Very Low Power - Early Proliferative Phase

- The Uterus at this point is comprised of Endometrium, Myometrium and Peritoneum/Serosa
- The endometrium is comprised of:
- Stratum compactum (SC) → Build up rapidly during the Menstrual Cycle (This is the darkest staining layer)
- Stratum spongiosum (SS) → Stains lighter than SC but darker than SB, containing loose fibromuscular tissue
- Stratum basalis (SB) → Contains lots of large blood vessels (stain pink)
- The myometrium contains densely interlaced bundles of smooth muscle, numerous large blood vessels in region adjacent to the serosa.
- The Stratum Spongiosum and Basalis are permanent layers of the Endometrium with the Stratum Compactum/Functionalis being shed during Menstruation

![xUte9700.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/xUte9700.jpg)

### Low Power

- The stroma of the Stratum Compactum has high cellular density, containing very few collagen fibres
- It contains uterine glands which are simple tubular gland that secrete Glycogen to provide nutrition to the Blastocyst upon implantation
- Many Lymphocytes can be found within the Stratum Compactum to provide Immune Surveillance to prevent Endometrial Infection

![Ute9703.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Ute9703.jpg)

- Helicine/Arcuate Arteries are large vessels that arise from the Ovarian Artery and run parallel to the Ovarian Artery along the length of the Myometrium
- Straight/Radial arteries arise from the Arcuate Arteries and run through the Myometrium to pass through and supply the Stratum Basalis (They are not constricted during menstruation)

![Ute9701.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Ute9701.jpg)

- The Endometrium Contains:
- surface epithelium (E) is only patchily preserved
- uterine glands (UG) - simple tubular, lined with cuboidal epithelium
- endometrial stroma (densely cellular connective tissue with numerous blood vessels) beneath surface epithelium

![Ute9702.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Ute9702.jpg)

# Human Uterus Menstrual

### Very Low Power

- There appears to be ‘weeping’/disintegration of Glandular and Stromal Debris, mixed with blood, into the Uterine Lumen
- The Stratum Functionalis/Compactum which stains darker is shed in its entirety during Menses whilst the Underlying Stratum Spongiosum (Stains lighter) is preserved

![Ute9900.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Ute9900.jpg)

### Low Power

- The surface epithelium is absent
- Eroded uterine glands, capillaries (often contain blood in the lumen) and raw endometrial stroma can be seen from the ragged exposed surface, which are also shed during Menses

![Ute9901.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Ute9901.jpg)

# Human Vagina-Cervix

### Very Low Power

- Opening of Cervical Canal into the Vagina = External Os
- There are branched mucous secretory glands (Simple Columnar Epithelium) opening into the cervical canal and secrete a mixture of mucous and shed cells into the cervical canal
- Deep to the Epithelium, Fibromuscular Tissue is found within the Cervix which can contain small nerves
- Cervix Epithelium = Simple Columnar
- Outer Aspect of the Cervix that extends into the Vagina is lined by stratified squamous epithelium that is continuous with that of the Vaginal Wall

![xCer9800.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/xCer9800.jpg)

### High Power

- At the base of the Vaginal Epithelium, Papillae of Stroma can be found
- The Vagina Contains Cornified Stratified Squamous Epithelium
- Papillae can reach deep into the epithelium and contain blood vessels, i.e. capillary loops, and autonomic and sensory nerve fibres.
- The nerves are involved in controlling the capillary permeability and are thought to control the transudation that performs the function of lubrication.

![Cer9804.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Cer9804.jpg)

# Human Mammary Gland - Resting

### Very Low Power

- Milk is a complex secretion containing protein, carbohydrate and a high fat content, all secreted by a single type of gland cell and stored within secretory units (alveoli) during pregnancy and lactation.
- Mammary glands have various functional states:
1. Resting - non-secretory
2. Pregnancy - preparation for lactation
3. Lactation - milk secretion
4. Regression - the gradual return to the resting non-secretory state
- The epithelial component is almost entirely represented by ducts (Identified by large, irregular lumens), with few (if any) small, secretory units (alveoli) being present.
- The terminal ducts are arranged in clusters separated by dense fibrous connective tissue, a typical lobular pattern.

![Mam4800.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Mam4800.jpg)

### High Power

- Intralobular Connective Tissue is much looser than Interlobular CT, with Interlobular CT often containing artefacts
- Looseness of Intralobular CT allows for the CT to be compressed as the glands to proliferate and expand during pregnancy and active lactation (CT is compressed as glands grow rather than Glands being compressed as they grow, as would be the case if the CT was dense)
- In resting mammary glands the secretory alveoli are virtually absent, but the system of ducts is present.
- The intralobular duct epithelium is usually a single layer of cuboidal cells with basal nuclei.
- The ducts are surrounded by myoepithelial cells (M) which are only lightly stained (and which make the outside of the ducts look fuzzy).
- There are abundant capillaries (Cap) in the intralobular connective tissue.

![Mam4803.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Mam4803.jpg)

- Collecting Ducts are large ducts embedded within Interlobular CT and may contain precipitated colostrum

![Mam4804.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Mam4804.jpg)

- The epithelium of the collecting ducts is usually two layers of cuboidal cells .
- Immediately beneath this epithelium the connective tissue is loose and highly vascularised with microvessels.
- The duct contains a secretion which is not milk or colostrum.
- Intralobular and interlobular ducts are affected by ovarian hormones, and as their circulating levels rise during the menstrual cycle the ductal cells are stimulated to secrete slightly and
the ducts distend (increasing the firmness of the breast at this time).

![Mam4805.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Mam4805.jpg)

# Human Mammary Gland - Pregnant

### Very Low Power

- In pregnant breast, there are now clearly defined lobules consisting of a mixture of massed ducts with variable numbers of secretory alveoli, the proportion depending on how far pregnancy had
advanced.
- These changes are patchy, with some lobules showing many dilated irregular-shaped secretory units while others consist solely of ducts.
- The eosinophilic secretion within ducts is colostrum.
- In the Pregnant Breast, Glandular Tissue is found in high quantities but there is minimal Intralobular CT → Interlobular CT can still be found between various Glandular Lobules
- In the human, milk production begins 2-3 days after giving birth at which time the secretory units (and thus the lobules) distend further, reducing the connective tissue component to a minimum.

![Mam4400.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Mam4400.jpg)

### Medium Power

- The epithelium of the intralobular ducts has proliferated and many of these ducts
now have a two-layered epithelium.

![Mam4402.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Mam4402.jpg)

# Lactating Mammary Gland

### Very Low Power

- In lactating breast the lobules are a densely packed mass of dilated, irregular, thin-walled secretory units (alveoli) - there is no distinction between secretory alveoli and intralobular ducts.
- Almost the entire mass of the Mammary Gland is full of Secretory Units/Alveolar Glands and Ducts, with thin Interlobular CT Septa being seen between these lobules
- The lobules are poorly demarcated from one another by thin strands of collagenous connective tissue (the interlobular septa).
- Intralobular connective tissue cannot be seen.
- The secretory units and interlobular ducts contain the secreted milk, seen as an eosinophilic protein coagulum with a foamy vacuolated appearance where the fat droplets have been dissolved out during preparation.

![Mam4600.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Mam4600.jpg)

- It is characteristic for the fatty component of the secretion to separate out and polarise within the alveoli/secretory units of the lobule.
- Interlobular Ducts can be seen running within the Interlobular Septa and carries Secretory Products from the Multiple Alveolar Glands towards the Nipple

![Mam4601.jpg](%5B042%5D%20Female%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%206d7d64b0b53c488e96e58d0e5b10b218/Mam4601.jpg)
