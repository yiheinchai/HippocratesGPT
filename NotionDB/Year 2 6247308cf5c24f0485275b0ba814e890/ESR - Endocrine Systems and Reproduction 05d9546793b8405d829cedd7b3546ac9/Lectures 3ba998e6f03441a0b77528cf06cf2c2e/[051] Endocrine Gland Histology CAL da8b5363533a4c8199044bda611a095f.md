# [051] Endocrine Gland Histology CAL

Progress: Not started

# Anterior Pituitary Gland

- Infundibulum = Pituitary Stalk
- Whereas the Anterior Pituitary Gland stains a deep purple (Glandular Tissue), the Posterior Pituitary Gland stains light pink and has the appearance of Nervous Tissue
- Basophil Cytoplasm stains deep blue/purple and Cytoplasm of Acidophils tends to stain pink or red
- GPA - GH and Prolactin = Acidophils
- B-FLAT - Basophils = FSH, LH, ACTH and TSH

---

# Thyroid

- C-Cells stain dark in comparison to the Thyroid Follicles

---

# Thymus

- Thymus produces Thymosin, important for stimulating the development of T Cells
- Outer Cortex contains many, dark-staining precursor cells (Thymocytes and Lymphoblasts) that are maturing into T Cells and Lymphocytes whilst being supported by Epithelial Reticular Cells
- Medulla = Lighter Staining deeper region containing Thymic/Hassall’s Corpuscles, mature lymphocytes and T Cells (but much fewer of these than found in the Cortex). It is also supported by Epithelial Reticular Cells

- The Thymus is divided into Lobules by Trabeculae that project deep from the thick outer capsule comprised of dense CT

- Epithelial Reticular Cells are very light staining cells, filled with secretory granules
- Thymocytes form the predominant mass of the Thymic Cortex and stains very dark purple

- Thymic/Hassall’s Corpuscles are lighter staining Thymic Corpuscles in the Medulla, comprised of Thymic Epithelial Cells organised in Concentric Circles

# Parathyroid Gland

- If a Chief Cell has just secreted PTH, it will have clear cytoplasm, surrounding a darkly staining nucleus (as it has released all of its secretory granules)
- If a Chief Cell has not yet secreted PTH, it will have dark cytoplasm, surrounding a darkly staining nucleus (as it has not yet released all of its secretory granules)

---

# Adrenal Gland

- The Kidney and Adrenal Gland are often surrounded by a protective layer of fat (Perirenal Fat Capsule) which surrounds the CT Capsule

# Pancreas

- Pancreatic Acini are Cuboidal to Pyramidal Cells that contain a granular purple cytoplasm, organised to form spherical units
- Within Pancreatic Islets of Langerhans, Alpha Cells tend to stain lighter than Beta Cells

---

# Testes and Ovaries

- Granulosa Lutein Cells - Enlarged, polygonal cells with light pink cytoplasm and large nuclei.
- Theca Lutein Cells - Oval to spindle shaped cells between the folds of granulosa lutein cells.

# Pineal Gland

- Pinealocytes - Modified Neurons that secrete melatonin, with small oval-shaped nuclei and pale-staining cytoplasm
- Brain Sand/Corpora Arenacea - Calcium Deposits form dense, darkly staining amorphous nodules within Pineal Tissue
- Melatonin regulates sleep wake patterns
