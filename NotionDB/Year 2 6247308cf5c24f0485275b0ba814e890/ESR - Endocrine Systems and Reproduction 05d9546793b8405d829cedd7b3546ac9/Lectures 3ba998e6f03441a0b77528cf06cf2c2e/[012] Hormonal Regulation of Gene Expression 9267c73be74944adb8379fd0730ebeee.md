# [012] Hormonal Regulation of Gene Expression

Progress: Not started

# Introduction

- Hormones regulate the function of their target cells by receptor mediated pathways.
- Hydrophilic Hormones: interact at the plasma membrane, and have their effect on gene expression through second messengers
- Hydrophobic Hormones: diffuse through the membrane, bind to their receptor and interact with their HRE (Hormone Response Element) on the gene of interest

# Classic Steroid Signalling

- In the classic model of steroid receptor signalling, steroids enter cells through the plasma membrane
- These then bind to their receptors localised in the cytoplasm (androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR)) or in the nucleus (oestrogen receptor-α (ER))
- Cytosolic Receptors, when inactivated, are found bound to Heat Shock Proteins
- When Steroids bind to the Cytosolic Receptor, the receptor releases its HSP, revealing the Nuclear Localisation Signal of the Receptor
- This allows the Steroid-bound receptors to translocate to the nucleus (cytoplasm receptors) and bind DNA to regulate gene transcription
- For Nuclear Receptors, the Steroid diffuses directly into the Nucleus, forming the Steroid:Receptor Complex here, where it can bind to DNA to regulate gene transcription
- This drives changes in mRNA expression, protein expression and cell biology
- As they act to alter Protein Synthesis via Transcription, this is a slow process, meaning they have a slow onset and offset but a long duration

# Nuclear Receptor Isolation

- The isolation of the first complete steroid receptor cDNAs, the glucocorticoid and oestrogen receptors, was transformative (Hollenberg et al., 1985)
- Conserved evolutionary structure between various receptors allowed structural and functional features of the nuclear receptor superfamily to be identified
- Transcriptional regulation by hormone receptor complexes was shown to be a fundamental process in the activity of the receptor
- Cloning of the first steroid receptors revealed that dozens of other evolutionarily related proteins exist
- ‘‘Orphan’’ receptors were shown to be conserved throughout metazoan evolution, although it should be noted that nuclear receptors are absent in protozoans, fungi, and plants
- These are receptors with unknown ligands, despite sharing structural components with identified receptors whose signalling molecules are known

---

# Orphan Receptors

- That there were orphan receptors immediately suggested the existence of a host of previously unknown signalling
pathways regulated by many undiscovered ligands
- Co-transfection assays provided a quantitative and highly efficient tool for screening, and as it was extremely sensitive to small-molecule ligands, it became the mainstay of ‘‘deorphaning’’ efforts
- This works by identifying the cDNA of the receptor and using this to identify ligands
- Early results showed that the DNA- and ligand-binding domains of the receptors function autonomously
- While, isolation of thyroid hormone in 1914 required 3.5 tons of bovine thyroid gland, molecular approaches have
led to a massive increase in new signalling systems

---

# Retinoid X Receptor

- Applying the reverse endocrinology approach to the retinoid X receptor (RXR) led to the identification of the first endogenous ligand for an orphan nuclear receptor (9- cis retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A), establishing
RXR as the founding member of the orphan class (Mangelsdorf et al., 1990)
- The discovery of RXR and its ligand  resulted in the genesis of two key concepts in the nuclear receptor field:
1. Novel signalling pathway, proof of concept that could link other orphan receptors to specific ligands
2. The discovery of RXR heterodimerization defining a novel feature of multiple interacting signalling pathways.

# Nuclear Receptors

- Approximately 50 human nuclear receptors
- Similar protein structure, especially within their DNA-binding domains (DBDs) which are highly conserved and the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) which are relatively conserved
- These conserved structures allows for other receptors to be identified as Nuclear Receptors if they have these typical characteristic conserved regions
- Essential functions as highly conserved
- NRs function, in part, through ligand binding and subsequent activation of their transcriptional activity (i.e. their ability to regulate target gene expression).

### Structure

A/B Domain (N-Terminal Domain)

- Sequence is highly variable between nuclear receptors.
- Contains the activation function 1 (AF-1) whose action is independent of the presence of ligand.
- The transcriptional activation of AF-1 is normally very weak, but it does synergize with AF-2 in the E-domain/LBD to produce a more robust upregulation of gene expression.

DNA Binding Domain (DBN/ C Domain)

- Highly conserved domain containing two zinc fingers that binds to specific sequences of DNA, the hormone response elements (HRE)

Hinge Region (D Domain)

- Thought to be a flexible domain that connects the DBD with the LBD.
- Influences intracellular trafficking and
subcellular distribution

Ligand Binding Domain (LBD/ E Domain)

- Moderately conserved in sequence and highly conserved in structure between   the various nuclear receptors.
- Along with the DBD, the LBD contributes to the dimerization interface of the receptor and in addition, binds coactivator and corepressor proteins.
- The LBD also contains the activation function 2 (AF-2) whose action is dependent on the presence of bound ligand, which occupies a region within the LBS

F Domain (C-Terminal Domain)

- Highly variable in sequence between various nuclear receptors.

# Nuclear Localisation

- The NRs, like all cellular proteins, are synthesized on ribosomes that reside outside the nucleus
- Import of the NRs into the nucleus from the cytoplasm after translation requires the nuclear localization signal (NLS), which is located near the border of the C and D domains
- For Cytosolic Nuclear Receptors, Heat Shock Proteins bind to the Receptor to act as a chaperone protein, covering the NLS to prevent the Migration of the Receptors into the Nucleus
- As a result of their NLSs, most of the NRs reside in the nucleus, with or without their ligands
- Hormone binding to the NR induces a conformational change that results in dissociation of the chaperone complex, allowing the hormone-activated GR to translocate to the nucleus by means of its NLS.

# Hormonal Response Elements

- HRE DNA sequence is the region of DNA that binds to a specific hormone receptor complex and regulates transcription
- Commonly a pair of inverted repeats separated by three nucleotides (as receptors binds as a dimers) → Palindromic Sequence
- The activated steroid receptor is the transcription factor binding the HRE
- A gene may have many different response elements, allowing complex control to be exerted over the level and
rate of transcription

# Nuclear Receptor Family

### Family III

- Family III NRs are the classic steroid hormone receptors:
1. glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
2. mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)
3. progesterone receptor (PR)
4. androgen receptor
(AR)
5. oestrogen receptor (ER)
- In the absence of ligand, these NRs are in non-functional complexes with heat-shock proteins thus transcriptionally inactive
- Ligand activation, the nuclear receptors bind DNA as homodimers to response elements configured as palindromes composed of two nucleotide sequences
separated by 3bp’s to active transcription.

### Family II

- Family II receptors comprise ‘orphan nuclear receptors’ (oNRs) because they lack known physiological ligands, except RXR.
- These bind to HREs that contain 2 x Identical DNA Sequences (in the same orientation/non-palindromic), separated by a few base pairs

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 18.09.47.png](%5B012%5D%20Hormonal%20Regulation%20of%20Gene%20Expression%209267c73be74944adb8379fd0730ebeee/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_18.09.47.png)

### Family I

- Family I, non-steroid receptors (i.e., RAR, VDR, and TR), bind preferentially to response elements composed of two
half-sites arranged as tandem repeats
- These receptors form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), even in the absence of ligand, and exert a repressive silencing/inhibitory effect on basal promoter activity (downregulate gene expression) that is reversed upon ligand binding to form the Steroid:Receptor Complex, attracting coactivators and RNA Polymerase to switch on transcription
- Specificity of receptor/DNA interactions is encoded by the spacing between the two half-sites repeats
- This gives rise to the 3-4-5 rule → When RXR and VDR/TR/RAR heterodimerise, there is a 3/4/5 bp gap between their HREs respectively

# RXR Heterodimers

- Receptor heterodimer can be activated by either the RXR ligand or the partner receptor ligand
- Permissive heterodimers are those that can be activated by ligands of either RXR (low level activation) or the other receptor found in the heterodimer (higher level activation)
- Non-permissive heterodimers are those that can only be activated by the partner’s ligand while RXR is silent
- Here, RXR cannot activate transcription but primarily stabilises the Heterodimer, ready for activation by the Ligand of the Partner receptor
- Simultaneous presence of both RXR and partner receptor ligands results in a larger response compared to binding of
only a single receptor ligand
- This allows for sensitivity of receptor signalling, producing different magnitudes of transcriptional changes dependent on the combination of ligands that stimulate the heterodimer
- An important regulatory feature of permissive receptor partners are Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated
Receptors (PPARs).
- PPAR Ligands can activate PPARs if they are found in a monomeric form, allowing them to activate other receptors that alter Gene expression but when PPARs heterodimerise with RXR,  they can directly bind to DNA Elements to alter gene expression directly

# Permissive/Non-Permissive

- From a pharmacologic perspective, a number of potent synthetic RXR ligands (called ‘‘rexinoids’’) have also been
described, because of their ability to simultaneously activate several heterodimers, such panagonists may have utility against multiple therapeutic targets simultaneously, allowing entire pathways to be upregulated
- Small changes in the ligand partner/Synthetic RXR Ligand can be amplified via RXR heterodimerization to increase cellular signalling
- By silencing RXR activity and responding only to their own ligands, non-permissive receptors permit transcriptional regulation that is directly proportional to the level of the hormone, thereby meeting the requirements of endocrine physiology.

---

# Cytoplasmic Nuclear Receptors

- Since the 1950’s steroid hormones responses that are too rapid (measured in seconds rather than minutes) to be
mediated through transcriptional regulation have been described in the scientific literature
- Steroid receptors can also be found at the plasma membrane
- Although most steroid receptors are located in the nucleus, ~ 5% of steroid receptors localizes to the plasma
membrane, including classic steroid receptors (ERs, PR,and AR).

# Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulators

- SERMs block the effects of oestrogen in the breast tissue without blocking its effects in other regions of the body
- SERMs bind to the Oestrogen receptor to prevent Oestrogen binding and activating the receptor
- No oestrogen binding – no signal to grow and multiply
- Cells in other tissues i.e. bones, uterus, also have oestrogen receptors but these are isoforms with a slightly different structure
- SERMs are "selective" – this means that a SERM that blocks oestrogen's action in breast cells can activate oestrogen's action in other cells, such as bone, liver, and uterine cells
- Three key SERMs:
1. Tam**oxifen**
2. Raloxifene
3. Toremifene
- Tamoxifen is the oldest, most well-known, and most-prescribed SERM.
- It is recommended that anyone on Tamoxifen only takes it for up to 5 years as whilst it is very potent, it will eventually stimulate effects in the Liver and Uterus to produce side effects, which are often poorly tolerated
