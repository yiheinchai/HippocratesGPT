# [043] Case Studies - Reproduction

Progress: Not started

# Case 1

- Prolactin levels of 6,000mU/L would usually indicate raised prolactin due to stalk compression caused by a large non- functional tumour.
- large macroprolactionmas >1cm in diameter usually have >10,000 mU/L prolactin levels.
- Additional measures of other pituitary hormones can show pan-hypopituitarism due to compression of the remaining pituitary tissue due to the tumour.
- Usually Rx of Hyperprolactinaemia due to Prolactinoma is Cabergoline
- This is a long-acting dopamine agonist, which can be used to reduced prolactin actions and prolactin secretion by causing tumour shrinkage.
- If prolactin levels are not raised, Dx is likely large non-functional pituitary tumour with Rx via Transphenoidal Surgery or Somatostatin Analogues (E.g Ocreotide) to try and shrink the tumour

# Case 2

- Ambiguous External Genitalia in CAH usually occurs in women as masculinisation of male genitalia is predominantly determined by Gonadal Vs Adrenal Androgens
- In CAH, Cliteromegaly occurs due to increased DHEA and Androstenedione production secondary to defective Glucocorticoid and Mineralocorticoid synthesis, causing masculinisation of external female genitalia in Utero
- Usually Rx of CAH is via Glucocorticoid and Mineralocorticoid supplementation to correct deficiencies and lower ACTH to reduce Adrenal Androgen production
- To correct the Masculinised/Sexually Ambiguous genitalia, surgical reconstruction to form external genitalia would occur
- As the Female with CAH still has normal, functioning internal genitalia (E.g Ovaries and Uterus and Menstrual and Ovarian Cycles)
- Sometimes, Behavioural masculinisation may have occurred due to excess adrenal androgens in utero and can result in gender dysphoria later on in life.

# Case 3

- If a Female Px presents with an extended period of amenorrhoea, 1st Ix = Pregnancy Test

### PCOS

- Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition, affecting 5 to 10% of women of childbearing age.
- The disorder is probably the most common hormonal abnormality in women of reproductive age and is certainly a leading cause of infertility.
- Although the underlying cause is not well understood, PCOS is generally characterised by an excess production of androgens (male hormones - usually testosterone), anovulation (the egg is not released by the ovary) and amenorrhoea, and by a varying degree of insulin resistance.
- Most women with PCOS have varying degrees of insulin resistance, obesity, and lipid dysfunction.
- Insulin resistance tends to be more pronounced in those who are obese and do not ovulate.
- These conditions put those with PCOS at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and so a woman with PCOS may have an OGGT to measure the degree of Insulin Resistance present.
- Hormone imbalances also affect the menstrual cycle in PCOS, causing infertility problems.
- Most women with this condition do not have regular monthly periods.
- Often they have chronic anovulation and amenorrhoea, but they may also experience irregular periods and uterine bleeding.
- With PCOS, both ovaries tend to be enlarged as much as 3 times their normal size.
- In 90% of women with PCOS, an ultrasound of the ovaries will reveal cysts (small immature egg-bearing follicles, fluid-filled follicles) that can be seen on the surface of the ovary.
- These ovarian cysts are often lined-up to form the appearance of a "pearl necklace."
- When the egg is not released and a woman is not menstruating, sufficient progesterone is not produced.
- This leads to a hormonal imbalance in which oestrogen acts "unopposed."
- This can lead to an overgrowth of the lining of the uterus (endometrial hyperplasia) and increases a woman's risk of developing endometrial cancer.
- Women with PCOS who do ovulate and become pregnant tend to have an increased risk of miscarriage.

### Hormonal Profile

- Raised LH
- Persistent Vs Cyclical Oestrogen Secretion (Raised)
- Low/Normal FSH so that LH:FSH Increases
- Low/Absent Progesterone
- Raised Testosterone/Androgens

### Cause

- PCOS is the most common cause (80% or more of cases) of chronic menstrual irregularity in reproductive-aged women.
- Because chronic anovulation/menstrual irregularity is a common cause of infertility (responsible for 15-25% of cases of infertility), and PCOS is the most common cause of chronic anovulation/menstrual irregularity, PCOS is a very common problem among patients attending infertility clinics.

### Rx

- There is no cure for PCOS.
- Although there have been cases involving the spontaneous resumption of menses, most women will have progressive symptoms until after menopause.
- Treatment of PCOS is aimed at reducing its symptoms and helping to prevent future complications.
- The goals are to promote ovulation, prevent endometrial hyperplasia, counterbalance the effects of androgen, and reduce insulin resistance.
- Treatment options depend on the type and severity of the individual patient's symptoms and on the patient's desire to become pregnant.
- Low-dose oral contraceptives are often used to stabilize hormones and oppose oestrogenic stimulation of the endometrium.
- Over several months, low-dose oral contraceptives can usually regulate menstrual periods, eliminate or minimise uterine bleeding, and reduce androgen levels (improving hirsutism and clearing up acne).
- Anti-androgens, such as spironolactone (aldactone), flutamide (Drogenil) and cyproterone (Androcur, Cyproterone acetate) are sometimes combined with oral contraceptives to help address more severe hirsutism and acne.
- Waxing, shaving, depilatory and electrolysis may be used to remove unwanted hair, and antibiotics or retinoic acids may be used to treat acne.
- Metformin (Glucophage) is used to reduce insulin resistance. It has also shown promising initial results in women with PCOS hirsutism and in helping to regulate menstrual cycles, but its effects on infertility and other symptoms are not yet known.
- This drug has not been licensed in the UK for use in non-diabetic patients.
- Weight loss and exercise are recommended to help decrease insulin resistance and to minimize lipid abnormalities.
- Weight reduction can also decrease testosterone, insulin, and LH levels.
- If a woman with PCOS wants to become pregnant, she is usually given clomiphene citrate (Clomifene, Clomid), a drug that helps induce ovulation.
- She may also be given human menstrual gonadotrophins (Merional, Menopur), although this drug increases the risk of multiple pregnancies.
