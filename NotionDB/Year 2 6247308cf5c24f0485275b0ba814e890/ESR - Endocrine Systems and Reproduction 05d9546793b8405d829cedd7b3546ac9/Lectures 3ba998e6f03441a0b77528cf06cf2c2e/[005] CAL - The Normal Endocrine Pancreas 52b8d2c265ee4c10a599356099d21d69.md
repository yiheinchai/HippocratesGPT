# [005] CAL - The Normal Endocrine Pancreas

Progress: Not started

# Development of the Pancreas

- Forms as dorsal and ventral outgrowths of the foregut
- These outgrowths form a branching duct system with Exocrine Acini forming at the terminal ends of these branches
- Some cells bud off from the Pancreatic Ducts and proliferate to form Islets of Langerhans

---

# Histology of the Pancreas

- Around 60% of Islet Cells are Beta Cells, 30% Alpha and 10% Delta Cells

# Insulin, Glucagon and Somatostatin

### Insulin

- Preproinsulin is encoded by the short arm of Chromosome 11
- Proinsulin is formed by the Cleavage of Preproinsulin at the N—Terminus within the Lumen of the rER
- Within the Golgi, Proinsulin is packaged into vesicles that contain Prohormone Convertase
- As the vesicles mature, Enzyme hydrolyses Proinsulin to liberate the C-Peptide between the α-chain and β-Chain, which become joined by 3 disuphide bonds
- Insulin then forms Hexamers associated with Zn²⁺, which forms the crystalline core of the Granules, surrounded by C-Peptide

### Glucagon

- Preproglucagon is encoded by Chr2
- Proglucagon is cleaved within the rER to form Glucagon, a single peptide chain
- Zn²⁺ is not an absolute requirement for the synthesis/secretion of Glucagon (Unlike Insulin) but Metal Complexes with Glucagon increase its half-life

### Somatostatin

- Synthesised as Preprosomatostatin, which is cleaved in the rER to form Prosomatostatin
- Differential Processing of Prosomatostatin can form SS-14 or SS-18 in varying amounts depending on the specific tissue
- Pancreas only produces SS-14 (Paracrine Somatostatin) and Intestines produce mainly SS-28 (Endocrine Somatostatin), with the number reflecting the number of AAs present

# Role in Metabolism

- Magnitude of Insulin response to oral protein intake is due to rise in Plasma [AA] and increased secretion of Gastrin, Secretin and CCK
- Incretin Effect is due to stimulation of Insulin Secretion by GI hormones (Gastrin, Secretin, CCK and GIP)
- GIP is also known as Glucose Dependent Insulinotropic Peptide
- GS and GP are the rate limiting enzymes of Glycogenesis and Glycogenolysis respectively
- Cortisol increases expression of HSL

# Review

- Adrenaline and Cortisol are involved in the Acute Stress respond and inhibit Insulin and Stimulate Glucagon Release. This increases Blood [Glucose] to provide increased metabolic substrates for tissues who’s activity increases due to stress response
- Incretins, CN X Stimulation and Hyperkalaemia stimulate insulin secretion
- CN X Stimulation before food is eaten allows for Anticipatory Rise in Insulin Secretion to counter Postprandial Hyperglycaemia
- GIP is secreted due to Hyperosmolarity of Content within the Duodenal Lumen and also leads to Anticipatory Rises in [Insulin] to prevent Postprandial Hyperglycaemia
- The release of insulin in response to hyperkalemia, protects excitable muscle cells from serious cardiac arrhythmias and skeletal muscle paralysis.
- Insulin does not stimulate Glucose Uptake in the Liver as the Liver expresses GLUT2 not GLUT4
- Glia Express GLUT1 and Neurons express GLUT3
