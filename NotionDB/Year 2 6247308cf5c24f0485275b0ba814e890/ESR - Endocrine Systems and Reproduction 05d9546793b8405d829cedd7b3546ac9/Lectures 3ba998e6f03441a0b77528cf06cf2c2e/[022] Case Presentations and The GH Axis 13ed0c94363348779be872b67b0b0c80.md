# [022] Case Presentations and The GH Axis

Progress: Not started

# Diagnosis - Clinical Observation

- From patient history you must rule out multiple non-endocrine causes for disordered growth/failure to thrive such as respiratory/cardiac/renal problems.
- Look at patient and assess whether there is proportionate growth (AKA Are certain parts of the body growing faster than others).
- Anthropometric measurements such as growth velocity/bone age/pubertal stages etc. should be taken.

---

# Diagnosis - Measure Serum GH By Immunoassay

- Need 0.5 ml of blood.
- Send to chemical pathology for immunoassay to measure Serum GH.
- Interpretation of serum GH values against normal ranges but this can be difficult due to the Pulsatile Secretion Pattern of Serum GH (Unable to know where Blood Sample was taken during Spike in GH Levels or not)

### Pulsatile Secretion Pattern of Serum GH

- There is pulsatile secretion of GH, with highest serum GH at night (sleep phases 3/4) and lower serum GH during day.
- Delayed Sleep or Delayed Waking Up can alter the normal GH Pulsatile Pattern
- As a result, a 24-hour profile should be taken and a single reading cannot be accurately interpreted due to the presence of sudden spikes in GH Levels across the circadian rhythm.
- Ideally, a 24 hr profile, where blood is taken 20 mins for 24 hours, would be best to produce a GH Plot for that circadian rhythm cycle
- However, a 24-hour profile is inconvenient for patient and lab

### Abnormalities

- Classic idiopathic GH deficiency: absent or only feeble peaks in GH levels across 24 hrs.

- GH excess: continuous secretion of high GH across the duration of the circadian rhythm. Absent pulsatility generally or large pulsatility with a high resting/base secretion .

# Dynamic Function Tests for GH Secretion

- Widely used as it deals with problem of irregular/pulsatile GH secretion

### Provocative Test → Used if Low GH is suggested

- Insulin tolerance test: where insulin is injected, and serum samples are taken every 20 mins for 4 hours.
- Normally serum GH should ↑ after insulin injection due to ↓ in blood glucose, reaching a maximum and then falling as Insulin Levels drop also (Duration of Response is a few hours).
- When Px is GH Deficient, they often have a very poor/absent response to ITT, producing little change/increases in GH Secretion
- Caution: risk of dangerous hypoglycaemia due to Insulin Bolus.
- Alternative stimulators that stimulate GH but are less likely to cause pronounced hypoglycaemia: Ghrelin, GHRH, Bovril (Due to high [Arginine]), Exercise or Clonidine to prevent Hypoglycaemia.

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 01.06.44.png](%5B022%5D%20Case%20Presentations%20and%20The%20GH%20Axis%2013ed0c94363348779be872b67b0b0c80/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_01.06.44.png)

### Suppression Test → Used if High GH Levels are suggested

- Drink glucose solution: then serum sample is taken every 20 mins for 4 hours.
- Normally, serum GH should rapidly ↓ due to rapid ↑ in blood glucose, with GH Levels then increasing as Glucose levels fall.
- No suppression in conditions where GH is in excess (pituitary tumours of
somatotrophs).
- As Glucose continues to fall (Due to Increased Insulin release as a result of previous hyperglycaemia), GH levels increase to reach a delayed/late maximum point (peaks when Glucose is at its lowest), mimicking an ITT at the end of the Suppression Test

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 01.07.23.png](%5B022%5D%20Case%20Presentations%20and%20The%20GH%20Axis%2013ed0c94363348779be872b67b0b0c80/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_01.07.23.png)

### GH Secretion Naturally Declines with Age

- During and After 3rd Decade
- It does not disappear completely as GH is required for metabolic functioning in adults
- Therefore for Px who are GH Deficient, GH supplements are needed before and during puberty to stimulate growth and also in adulthood to maintain normal metabolic functionality

### IGF-1 Levels

- Also measured by immunoassay.
- Not widely used as GH measurements.
- Confined to specialist centres.

### IGF Binding Proteins

- IGF is bound to Binding Proteins when transported in the Blood
- Measured in specialist centres for difficult cases.
- Research rather than routine.

# Growth Hormone Deficiency

- Initially GH replacement was in form of cadaveric pituitary GH as GH from other species does not stimulate growth in humans.
- Development of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (a degenerative brain disorder) in those who were treated with hGH produced in this way, led to discontinuation of all products derived from human pituitary gland.
- This has led to development of artificial (recombinant) hGH (rhGH) to treat children with growth disorders since 1985.
- Over years there has been a push to create a taller society among parents and physicians.
- There is now a pharmacological repertoire that includes direct growth-promoting agents such as rhGH and, now, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in US and in Europe, and, historically anabolic steroids.
- This is an expensive course of treatment and has associated side effects so is not commonly carried out (E.g Use of IGF-1 can produce Hypoglycaemia and hence, is poorly tolerated)
- An alternative approach to height augmentation employs agents that elongated the period of puberty during which growth can occur and, in particular, oestrogen production (in both sexes), which is responsible for ultimate epiphysial fusion such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnHR) agonists and, more recently, aromatase inhibitors.
- This therefore delays Growth Plate closure so that Px can be given rGH over a longer period of time to stimulate growth, causing a more pronounced increase in Growth
- These approaches have been used as sole treatments or in various combinations, with varying efficacy and safety.

---

# Classic Idiopathic Growth Hormone Deficiency (Idiopathic Dwarfism)

- There is proportionate growth of all body components and patient is of normal appearance, except there is low growth rate.
- There is also truncal obesity (rounded abdomen) and immature facial features.
- Px will have a Low Growth Rate and hence, low SD Score
- There is no, or little, response to an ITT provocation test and no/weak peaks in a 24-hour GH profile.
- Low IGF-1 will be seen if recorded.
- Treatment with recombinant GH can be given if there is sufficient pre-pubertal time for catch-up growth.
- This is given as single large daily subcutaneous/IM injections (usually at night as this tends to be when GH Pulses tend to be most frequent) of rGH if Deficiency is caught when there is still a sufficient window of pre-pubertal time, during which growth can occur to allow the Px to ‘catch up’ with growth.
- This is usually give 5x a week
- Recombinant GH treatment is very expensive and hence, many countries often have high cut offs/criteria that must be met before Px is given rGH.
- Different countries have different cut-off criteria for deciding when provocative test has failed (e.g. After glucose infusion or ITT).
- Before Rx, check on Tanner chart to see if there is a sufficient pre-pubertal window for rGH to produce sufficient effects, with SD score can be seen to improve greatly if there is enough pre-pubertal time left.

# Laron Syndrome (Growth Hormone Resistant Px)

- Zvi Laron (1966)
- Rare, autosomal recessive condition.
- Key points for diagnosis:
1. Rare, autosomal recessive condition.
2. Very low SD score/growth velocity.
3. Proportionate growth but with a very immature face
4. Normal GH levels.
5. Low IGF-1.
- In some Px, cartilaginous tissues can appear suppressed (E.g Nasal Bridge) due to chondrocyte sensitivity to GH
- Defective GHRs leading to GH Resistance: Laron’s Syndrome shows a spectrum of severity depending on mutation site and hence, its impact on GH Signalling.
- In most severe cases, large deletions of GH receptor (notably the extracellular domain) have been identified as they prevent GH from binding to and hence, stimulating GHR.
- The severity of the mutation and hence, the level of GHR Activity can be determined by testing binding of GH to circulating GHBP (extracellular domain of GHR cleaved from the Transmembrane/Cytosolic Domain to allow for GH Transport and Stability in the blood).
- Most severe cases have no binding.
- Less severe cases have ↓ binding affinity.

### Treatment

- Defective GH receptors:
1. Recombinant hGH not effective as pathology lies in receptor not hormone.
2. Trials with recombinant IGF-1 → Low Conformity due to excessive hypoglycaemia and rapid facial ageing. 
- Growth Factors like IGF-1 are believed to be essential life, with mutations to these causing death in utero
- 1 patient has been described with partial deletion in gene for IGF-1.
- Severe growth retardation in utero with no Post-natal growth
- Sensorineural deafness/mental retardation/GH resistance.

# Achondroplasia

- The most common form of disproportionate short stature 1:15,000 – 40,000 live births
- Characterised by:
1. Shortening of proximal limbs (rhizomelic shortening)
2. Short fingers and toes with trident hands
3. Large head with prominent forehead frontal bossing
- AKA Short limbs but normal sized head and torso
1. Small midface with a flattened nasal bridge
2. Spinal kyphosis (convex curvature) or lordosis (concave curvature)
3. Varus (bowleg) or valgus (knock knee) deformities
- This is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene and when inherited, it is an Autosomal Dominant condition (This is possible as Achondroplasia does not impact Reproductive capacity)
- 80-90% of these mutations are spontaneous
- Homozygous Px die shortly before or after birth
- Complications: ear infections (Eustachian tube blockages), sleep apnea (central or obstructive), hydrocephalus and pinal compression.
- Achondroplasia is result of defective receptors for FGF, therefore not responsive to GH therapy as GH signalling is normal here

---

# Detection and Rx of Achondroplasia

### Detection

- Most of these mutations have been well identified and hence, can be screened for, notably if either parent is affected (As it is Autosomal Dominant)
- Two FGFR3 mutations identified, both
occur at nucleotide 1138 of the cDNA sequence and result in an glycine or arginine substitution at codon 380 (G380R)
- The most common mutation, a G to A transition, is found in 97% of patients a new 164bp PCR product derived from the FGFR3 gene yields 109 bp and 55 bp fragment
- G to C transversion is seen in ~3% of patients

![Screenshot 2022-01-28 at 09.23.24.png](%5B022%5D%20Case%20Presentations%20and%20The%20GH%20Axis%2013ed0c94363348779be872b67b0b0c80/Screenshot_2022-01-28_at_09.23.24.png)

### Treatment

- Alleviate Sx
- Phase 1 Started in 2012 using C-Natriuretic Peptide
- Phase 2 started in 2016
- These have not yet been licensed for wider clinical use

---

# Malabsorption Syndrome - Coeliac Disease

- Proportional growth failure due to nutritional Vs Endocrine deficiency
- GH normal.
- E.g. gluten-sensitive enteropathy.
- When Px is gluten-free diet to stop enteropathy, Growth Rate rapidly recovers back to normal levels (If Dx during Prepubertal Period during which growth is possible).

---

# Idiopathic GH Deficiency

- Non-identical twins.
- Unknown cause
- Proportional short stature in 1 twin
- Proportional Short Stature is often diagnostic of an abnormality impacting GH

---

# Hypothyroidism

- Limbs are shorter but trunk and head are normal size, with patients not achieving their full growth potential.
- GH is low and thyroid hormones (T3/T4) are also low.
- Low TH Reduces GH Release and hence slows down and reduces growth
- Hypothyroidism corrected by Levothyroxine to restore TH Levels and hence, GH Levels to allow for Catch Up growth to restore normal growth during puberty

---

# Juvenille Cushing’s Syndrome

- Growth is proportionate, but patient does not achieve full growth potential.
- Present with Typical Sx of Cushing’s Syndrome (Large/Rounded Abdomen, Thin Limbs and Rounded and Red Face)
- GH is low and there are symptoms of excess cortisol secretion from Adrenal Cortex.
- Rx → Correct Excess Cortisol/Cortisol Secretion to normalise GH Signalling

---

# Pseudohypoparathyroidism

- Growth is proportionate, but patients do not achieve their full growth potential.
- Individuals generally have a round face and **4th metacarpal is very short**.
- Patients have a high PTH level but there is resistance to PTH due to Mutations in PTH-R.
- GH levels are normal.

---

# Turner’s Syndrome

- Females have an XO genotype (only 1 sex chromosome).
- Individual are short in stature and have a webbed neck
- Short Stature is because lack of Sex Chromosome causes reduced Sex Steroid Production, preventing its sensitising effects on GHRs to increase GH Signalling
- rGH Therapy does improve growth to increase GHR Stimulation back to normal levels

![Screenshot 2022-01-28 at 09.32.26.png](%5B022%5D%20Case%20Presentations%20and%20The%20GH%20Axis%2013ed0c94363348779be872b67b0b0c80/Screenshot_2022-01-28_at_09.32.26.png)

---

# Precocious Puberty

- Early sexual maturity and initially rapid growth, but growth stops early as there is early epiphyseal fusion, causing Px to be shorter than average.

---

# Delayed Puberty

- When puberty occurs after 15 years → Could Indicate HPG Defect.
- There is a prevalence of 1:50 and a
ratio of 6:1 of M:F.
- Growth slows down around age of 10 years and height falls below 3rd centile.
- Bone age is delayed by 2 years, indicating that there is a period of growth potential despite their chronological age.
- LH/FSH are low but GH is normal with growth being impaired as there is reduced Sensitisation of GHR by LH/FSH, meaning there is no Pubertal Growth Spurt at the normal chronological age.
- Catch-up growth does occur but later in life and individuals do usually achieve their full growth potential.
- Oxandrolone is an anabolic steroid (weak androgen) that cannot be aromatized to oestrogen, therefore does not advance bone age or lead to growth plate closure which would impair growth.
- This will not shorten pre-pubertal window but will stimulate growth in boys with delayed puberty by increasing the magnitude of response seen by GHR in response to GH, producing growth rate seen in Pubertal Growth Spurt.
- Lower doses must be given in girls to prevent masculinisation due to Testosterone Accumulation and Excessive AR Signalling.

---

# Anorexia Nervosa

- Prevalence of 1:100 for females
- Food Deprivation can turn off the hypothalamic as GnRH is sensitive to body weight (Energy, Nutrient and Tissue Stores).
- Where these stores are reduced, Hypothalamus is switched off to reduce GnRH so that growth only occurs when it is efficient and feasible (does not deplete already low body stores, which could further compromise health)
- There is low GnRH release, and fasting GH and cortisol are raised.
- Here, cortisol acts to oppose the activity of GH to suppress growth in conditions where efficient Growth is not feasible

---

# Intrauterine Growth Retardation

- Low birth weight.
- This can be due to placental insufficiency (lack of nutrient or blood supply to placenta)
- Px show poor catch-up growth despite potentially normal GH

---

# Cranial Irradiation

- E.g. for Rx of leukaemia or brain tumours.
- The Pituitary is particularly radiation sensitive and can cause death of Somatotrophs within the Anterior Pituitary Gland, leading to Low GH

---

# Chronic Illness

- Non-Endocrine disorders can also cause Failure to Thrive and impact Growth Potential
- Congenital heart disease.
- Chronic obstructive or infective pulmonary disease.
- Chronic renal failure.

---

# Psychosocial Deprivation

- Emotional and social upheaval can lead to hypothalamic turn-off (similar to that seen in Anorexia Nervosa) due to suppression of the HPT Axis due to Hyperactivity of the HPA Axis
- This leads to lack of GHRH.

---

# Before Puberty - Giantism

- Continuous high pre-pubertal GH levels
distort growth leading to excessive early growth (Longer High Growth Velocity) and delayed puberty.
- There is delayed puberty as there is compromised pituitary function due to  compression of other non-somatotropic pituitary cells in restricted space of sella turcica due to somatotroph hyperplasia, which reduces other pituitary functions that arise from other pituitary cell types (E.g Gonadotrophs that secrete LH and FSH to stimulate Oestradiol secretion and hence Growth Plate fusion/termination of Growth).
- This means that there is a prolonged pre-pubertal linear growth period prior to exaggerated growth spurt. This results in excessive height attainment.
- Could be due to a benign tumour of somatotrophs leading to autonomous, unregulated, non-pulsatile GH secretion that are not under the control of GHRH.
- This incidence of pituitary tumours is as follows Prolactin > ACTH > GH.
- Tumours that produce either Prolactin or GH can produce a Mixture of Prolactin and GH as these 2 hormones are very similar in structure, with ancestrally related genes (Hence, Prolactin might be raised in GH Tumour and vice versa)
- Pituitary tumours that produce LH/FSH/TSH are very rare.
- Poor prognosis if untreated.
- Easily recognised syndrome, with a High SD score that should be picked up in childhood (recognised early)
- The tumour, which can be imaged with MRI, removed surgically to rapidly correct GH before too excessive growth has occurred.
- Tumour is often Removed Transphenoidally, through the Nose and  Sphenoid Process to access the Inferior Aspect of the Sella Turcica
- After surgery, impaired endocrine function may recover if normal pituitary tissue has been preserved.
- Px may need to have GH levels monitored afterwards to ensure they maintain normal GH levels despite fewer Somatotrophs but also to check for Raised GH due to Tumour regrowth
- For others, difficulties in growth, development and sexual maturation may persist due to damage to surrounding non-somatotropic cells due to surgery/tumour.
- Careful replacement therapy is needed for a normal life if large chunks of Pituitary Gland need to be removed, damaging other cell types.

# Post-Puberty : Acromegaly

- No potential for ↑ height as oestrogen has already lead to closure of epiphyseal growth plates.
- Acromegaly is very rare and occurs in 3/1,000,000.
- There is insidious/slow onset (normally with enlarged cartillaginous and visceral structures E.g Large Nasal Bridge, Ears, Jaw Line and Brow Line)
- Usually, around 25% of the population  are found to have Pituitary Tumours post mortem, which usually stain for Prolactin but are subclinical
- Rx = GH Inhibitors to lower GH levels to prevent further Visceral and Cartillaginous Hyperplasia/Enlargement but does not correct previous enlargement that has occurred
- ↑ GH causes raised IGF-1, which leads to proliferation of bone, cartilage and soft tissues, and also leads to an ↑ in size of other organs (E.g Heart).
- Hands and feet are enlarged, lower jaw protrudes and there is dental malocculsion (teeth do not occlude properly due to jaw misalignment caused by abnormal growth of Jaw Cartilage) despite no weight gain.
- ↑ GH also opposes insulin leading to an ↑ risk of DM and associated symptoms (polydipsia, polyuria, recurrent UTI,
retinopathy, neuropathy).
- Treatments include somatostatin/GHIH analogues (octreotride) and GHR Antagonist (Mutated GH with additional side chain) which prevents receptor activation.
- GHR has 2 binding sites, and GHR Antagonist binds normally to Site 1 but the side chain prevents the Antagonist from binding to Site 2, preventing dimerisation and hence, activation of GHR
- Previously, dopamine agonists like bromocriptine were used (but rarely now) to inhibit Prolactin Secretion from Pituitary Tumours that also produce GH
- Surgical: transphenoidal route guided by MRI scan usually. Transfrontal route through the orbit can be used if tumour is large and protrudes superior to the optic chiasm (and often compresses this chiasm to cause Bitemporal Hemianopia).
- Radiotherapy: conventional super voltage (slow effect in ↓ tumour size). Often results in eventual hypothyroidism by damaging Thyrotrophs that produce TSH (and deficiencies of other hormones by damaging Non-Somatotrophic cells via radiotherapy)

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 01.18.46.png](%5B022%5D%20Case%20Presentations%20and%20The%20GH%20Axis%2013ed0c94363348779be872b67b0b0c80/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_01.18.46.png)

# Pituitary Tumours

- Show a range of hormonal and proliferative behaviours.
- Mutations in classic oncogenes and tumour-suppressor genes are however rarely associated with pituitary tumours.
- In fact, most mechanisms of endocrine tumourigenesis differ significantly, from those associated with haematological
malignancies and non-endocrine tumours.
- Instead, tumorigenesis is promoted by hormones and growth factors involved in Pituitary Development, causing most tumours to be benign vs malignant

---

# Growth Hormone Use

### In Children

1. Growth hormone deficiency in children.
2. Growth hormone use following cranial irradiation which damaged Somatotrophs, causing Low GH.
3. Small for gestational age (SGA) AKA Interuterine Growth Retardation.
4. Growth delay in children with chronic renal failure due to Dysregulation of Calcium and Phosphate → Reduced ability to synthesise bone and grow which lowers growth potential.
5. Turner syndrome
6. Prader-Willi syndrome → Some have short stature despite over eating

### In Adults

1. Growth hormone deficiency continued into adulthood → This is not standard but can be used to improve Nitrogen Balance etc.

---

# Growth Regulation Throughout Life

- Foetus: IGF-2 controls growth.
- Infancy: nutrition rather than GH/IGF-1 most important during year 1.

### Last-Time Growth Velocity

- Postnatal growth rapid (15 cm/y).
- Declines by 3 to a plateau (6 cm/y).
- At puberty, GH/IGF-1 ↑ (growth spurt), which peaks at Late Teens/Early 20s.
- Oestrogens close growth plates at end of puberty in boys and girls.
- However, Long Term GH replacement is not known

---

# Final Picture - Growth Regulation Throughout Life

- After puberty GH steadily ↓ throughout adult life, resulting in:
- Is there a definitive Somatopause (Progressive decline and eventually, complete absence of GH and IGF-1 Secretion)
- Reduced GH seen in age-related decline in GH is important for:
1. Central adiposity → Reduced Lipolysis
2. ↓ muscle mass. → Reduced Protein Synthesis

---

# Growth Hormone Replacement

- Growth hormone receptor-deficient people (Laron syndrome) do not get 2 of major diseases of ageing, cancer and diabetes.
- 22-year study followed 100 Laron’s along with 1,600 relatives of normal stature.
- Only 1 non-lethal case of cancer was diagnosed In Px with Laron’s Syndrome. As far as 1,600 relatives go, 5% of Laron’s Disease Px developed diabetes in same time period while 17% were diagnosed with cancer.
- Therefore GH activity in adults who are beyond their growing years may be harmful, notably in development of Cancer and hence, is not advised
