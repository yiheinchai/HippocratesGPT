# Measuring Weight

- Adults should remove shoes and heavy clothing before they are weighed whereas children should be weighed without any clothes on
- If a Px cannot stand, use bed/chair scales to measure weight

---

# BMI

- BMI is not an accurate reflection of Total Body Fat in Athletes and Oedematous Px as Muscle Mass and Oedema will increase body weight

# Ideal Weight and Weight Loss

**Males**

1. Allow 48 kg (105 lb) for 1.5 m (4.9 ft) of height.
2. Add 0.8 kg (1.7 lb) for each additional centimeter over 1.5 m (4.9 ft).
3. Then subtract 10% for a small frame or add 10% for a larger frame.

**Females**:

1. Allow 45 kg (99 lb) for 1.5 m (4.9 ft) of height.
2. Add 0.7 kg (1.5 lb) for each additional centimeter over 1.5 m (4.9 ft).
3. Then subtract 10% for a small frame or add 10% for a larger frame.
- Waist circumference is a good indicator of abdominal fat, and provides an estimation of relative risk for heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension.
- A waist measurement of >80 cm in women, and >94 cm in men increases the risk for these diseases.

### Weight Loss

- Weight loss is considered significant if it falls into any of the following parameters, and may indicate poor nutritional status and/or health problems:
1. 1–2% in 1 week.
2. 5% in 1 month.
3. 7.5% in 3 months.
4. 10% in 6 months.

# Blood Glucose Measurements

- BGLs can be measured via Point of Care Testing
- BGL is ideally between 4-7 mmol/L (72-126 mg/dL)
- When measuring Capillary BGL, you should take blood from the edge of the fingers as the Fingertips are more sensitive than the edges
- Before you take a Capillary BGL, you should warm the hands before (Maximise blood flow to the fingers to allow you to get a sample more easily) and clean the skin with water and then dry (not alcohol swab)
- When taking blood, you should keep the finger below the level of the heart, and allow a large drop of blood to fall onto the test strip

### Symptoms

| Hypoglycaemia | Hyperglycaemia | Both |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clammy Skin | Polydipsia | Confusion or Agitation |
| Pallor | Polyuria | Reduced Consciousness |

# Urinalysis

- Urine must be tested within a few hours of being collected as Urinary constituents can become unstable, and may affect test results
- If a delay in testing is anticipated, the sample should be kept in the fridge to limit the speed at which the constituents become unstable
- Haematuria can look bright red or brown/smokey
- Bilirubin can turn urine brown/green or a strong yellow colour
- Food items (Beetroot) and drugs (Rifampicin) can also alter urine colour
- Fruity smell of urine can indicate Ketones in the Urine in a Px with Diabetes
- 50 ml of Mid-Stream Urine is required for Urinalysis
1. Wear Clean Gloves
2. Clean the Meatus with Soap and Water
3. Have the Px Void into the container and discard the Initial 30 ml
4. Collect Urine into a Sterile Container
5. Stop collecting Urine before they finish voiding
6. Allow the Px to finish Voiding
7. Label the Container
