Progress: Not started

# Functions and Organisation of Pancreas

### 2 Main Functions of Pancreas

- Exocrine (acinar cells): accessory digestive, synthesise pancreatic enzymes that flows through ducts.
- Endocrine (islets of Langerhans): ductless, secretes hormones directly into blood.

### Organisation of Pancreas

- Anatomical position: lies deep in stomach, tail close to spleen, and head is encircled by duodenum.
- It is supplied by the Splenic and Gastroduodenal arteries
- Lobules: 80% of mass. Acinar cells secrete enzymes and fluid into the Intercalated ducts.
- Ducts: 4% of mass. Intercalated ducts join to form pancreatic duct.
- This fuses with common bile duct before emptying into the 3rd part of the duodenum via the ampulla.
- Islets of Langerhans: 2% of mass ‚Üí Organised as highly vascularised spheres
1. Sympathetic adrenergic input: Splanchnic nerve (from coeliac plexus).
2. Parasympathetic cholinergic input: Vagus Nerve.

| Islets of Langerhans Cell Types | Secrete |
| --- | --- |
| Œ± Cells | Glucagon |
| Œ≤ Cells (Most Numerous Cells) | Insulin |
| Œ¥ Cells | Somatostatin |
| PP Cells | Pancreatic Polypeptide |

# Structure of Pancreatic Hormones

### Structure of Pancreatic Hormones

- All Pancreatic Hormones are peptide hormones and are commonly synthesised as prohormones

### Insulin

- Synthesised in pancreatic ùõΩ cells.
- Single chain precursor: preproinsulin (green part is preinsulin).
- Removal of signal peptide: proinsulin (everything apart from green part) found within the Insulin Secreting Granules.
- Signal Peptide (=‚ÄôPre‚Äô region of Peptide) is the region of the peptide that signals to the cell to secrete the hormone
- Made in endoplasmic reticulum, packaged in Golgi network, then secreted.
- Proinsulin has 3 domains
1. N-terminal B chain.
2. C-terminal A chain.
3. Middle C-peptide (lost when insulin formed).
- Cleaved by prohormone convertases 1 and 3, which cleaves the C-peptide from the Proinsulin.
- C-Peptide is still present in the Secretory Granules and is secreted alongside Mature Insulin (C-Peptide markers can be used as a proxy marker of Insulin secretion)
- Insulin itself is B and A chain stuck together by 3 disulphide bonds, which folds the Insulin into its correct conformation.

### Glucagon

- 29 AA peptide hormone.
- Synthesised from preproglucagon.
- GLP-1 and GLP-2 are structurally similar to glucagon (as If glucagon was cloned 3 times) and are found within Proglucagon.
- Differential Processing of Preproglucagon can produce Oxyntomodulin (Glucagon + IP-1) and Glicentin (Glucagon + GRPP + IP-1)
- IP-1 is found between Glucagon and GLP-1 in Preproglucagon and GRPP is found proximal to Glucagon
- Proglucagon 1-61 = GRPP + Glucagon
- Processed by prohormone convertases 1 and 2, with these different forms of the Enzyme giving rise to differential processing of Preproglucagon.
- There is Differential processing in ùõº cells vs L cells.
- ùú∂ cells in Pancreas: release glucagon.
- L cells in GI Tract and Neurons: release GLP-1 (Mainly in Neurons as Neurotransmitter), GLP-2 and oxyntomodulin.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 15.04.20.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_15.04.20.png)

### Other Pancreatic Hormones (All Peptide Hormones)

- Somatostatin: paracrine role (suppresses insulin and glucagon) ‚Üí Cyclical Structure.
- Pancreatic polypeptide: secreted after eating and suppresses appetite.
- Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP or
amylin): appears to suppress insulin secretion.

# Control of Pancreatic Hormone Release

### Role of Insulin and Glucagon

- Glucagon is a functional antagonist of Insulin and vice versa to provide fine control of Blood Glucose.
- Insulin is an anabolic hormone as it stimulates Protein Synthesis and Glycogenesis
- Glucagon is a catabolic hormone as it stimulates the breakdown of Proteins, Glycogen and Fatty Acids

### Stimulation of Insulin

| Increased Glucose |  |
| --- | --- |
| Amino Acids |  |
| Gut Hormones release postprandially | GLP-1 (Released from L Cells in the Gut) and GIP (Gastric Inhibitor Peptide) are both Incretins |
| Glucagon | Stimulates Insulin Secretion, which opposes Glucagon activity to establish a Negative Feedback Loop |
| ACh | PSNS |
| ùõº1 adrenoceptor | SNS |
| ùõΩ2 adrenoceptor | SNS |

### Inhibition of Insulin Secretion

| Reduced Glucose |  |
| --- | --- |
| Somatostatin | Intraislet Pancreatic Somatostatin (Paracrine) and Gastric Somatostatin (Less Significant) |
| ùõº2 adrenoceptor via Adrenaline stimulation | Dependent on the Organism studied |

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 15.05.57.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_15.05.57.png)

### Insulin Secretion

1. Raised Extracellular glucose enters ùõΩ cells through GLUT-2 (constitutive expressed glucose transporter).
2. Once inside ùõΩ cells, it is metabolised to form ATP via respiration
- Phosphorylation of Glucose by Glucokinase traps it in the cell so that it can no longer efflux via GLUT2
1. ‚Üë ATP:ADP ratio.
2. ‚Üë ATP is sensed by K‚Å∫ATP channels, which causes them to close. 
3. In response, these close, causing depolarisation of membrane and L-Type voltage-gated Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channels to open.
4. Increased [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] binds to Insulin storage granules to cause insulin and C-Peptide (1:1 Ratio) release.
- This mechanism is important for sensing [Glucose] in the ùõΩ cells and Hypothalamus

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 15.28.11.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_15.28.11.png)

# Glucagon and Somatostatin

### Stimulation of Glucagon Secretion

1. Reduced Glucose
2. Amino Acids (Like Insulin)
3. Adrenaline
4. GIP

### Inhibition of Glucagon Secretion

1. Increased Glucose
2. GLP-1

### Gastric/Endocrine Somatostatin Secretion (Inhibits Glucagon and Insulin Secretion)

1. Carbohydrates
2. Proteins
3. Fats
- 1+2+3 = Mixed Meal
1. ‚Üì pH in duodenum: by gastric acid released into the Duodenum when food enters the stomach and is digested, allowing Somatostatin to reduce acid secretion in a -ve feedback loop (bulbogastrone mechanism).

### Endocrine Vs Paracrine Somatostatin

- Endocrine SST is mainly released from gastric D cells:
1. Inhibition of gastric acid secretion.
2. Inhibition of gastric emptying.
3. ‚Üì small bowel contractions.
- Pancreatic SST is likely to play paracrine role:
1. Inhibition of pancreatic exocrine secretion.
2. Inhibition of pancreatic endocrine secretion (insulin, glucagon, ghrelin etc.)

### Glucagon Secretion

1. Lowered Extracellular Glucose enters Œ± cells through GLUT-2 (constitutive expressed glucose transporter).
2. Once inside Œ± cells, it is metabolised to form ATP via respiration
- Phosphorylation of Glucose by Glucokinase traps it in the cell so that it can no longer efflux via GLUT2
1. ATP:ADP ratio Decreases.
2. ATP is sensed by K‚Å∫ATP channels. 
3. In response to lowered [ATP], some of these close, causing slight depolarisation of membrane
4. This causes voltage-gated Na‚Å∫ channels  to open, to cause a more pronounced depolarisation which opens P/Q Type Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Channels, causing Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Influx.
5. Increased [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] binds to Glucagon storage granules to cause Glucagon Release
- When Glucose is high, Raised ATP:ADP prevents  K‚Å∫ATP Channels from closing, causing Voltage Gated Na‚Å∫ Channels to stay closed, preventing further depolarisation
- This keeps P/Q Type Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Channels closed to prevent Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Influx and hence, Glucagon Release

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 20.33.21.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_20.33.21.png)

# Release of Somatostatin

1. Raised Extracellular glucose enters Œ¥ cells through GLUT-2 (constitutive expressed glucose transporter).
2. Once inside Œ¥ cells, it is metabolised to form ATP via respiration
3. ‚Üë ATP:ADP ratio.
4. ‚Üë ATP is sensed by K‚Å∫ATP channels. 
5. In response, these close, causing depolarisation of membrane and L-Type voltage-gated Ca¬≤‚Å∫ channels to open.
6. Increased [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] binds to Somatostatin storage granules to cause Somatostatin release
- Somatostatin then acts in a Paracrine Fashion on Œ± Cells to further suppress Glucagon Secretion

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 20.42.23.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_20.42.23.png)

# Incretin Effect and GLP-1 and GIP

### Incretin Effect

- If a Px is asked to drink pure glucose, there will be a rapid peak in Blood Insulin levels before falling back to normal levels
- If the glucose is given IV vs Orally, there is reduced insulin secretion
- Therefore, this reduced Insulin Secretion when Glucose is ingested vs given IV = Incretin Effect due to the effect of Incretins on stimulating Insulin Secretion when food is eaten
- The Incretin Effect is reduced in T2DM

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 20.46.27.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_20.46.27.png)

- These cells sense glucose that are passing through the Stomach and secrete GLP-1 and GIP
- These Incretins (GLP-1 and GIP), are secreted by L and K Cells in the Stomach and Small Intestines respectively
- They bind to their GPCRs, increase cAMP and activate PKA, which closes KATP channels in the √ü-cell
- This depolarises √ü Cells to increase √ü Cell stimulation to Increase Insulin Release
- This Incretin Effect sends an advanced signal to the Pancreas before Glucose is Absorbed into the Blood to allow for sufficient [Insulin] to prevent Hyperglycaemia
- Incretins also hyperpolarise Œ± Cells to reduce Glucagon secretion
- GLP-1 and GIP are metabolised into inactive peptides by DPP-4, excreted by the Kidneys

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 20.47.36.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_20.47.36.png)

### GLP-1 and GIP are Secreted in Response to Eating

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 20.47.21.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_20.47.21.png)

# Counter-Regulatory Coordination of Metabolism

### Carbohydrate Metabolism and Insulin

- ‚Üë blood [glucose] stimulates release of insulin.
1. Facilitates entry of glucose to tissues: especially liver, muscle, adipose.
2. Stimulates liver to store glucose in form of glycogen (glucose raises the tonicity of water, so enters via osmosis causing cell lysis. Therefore, store as glycogen instead).

### Glucose Disposal (Glucose Being Taken Out of Blood or Peripheral Tissue)

- Glucose disposal = rate of uptake into peripheral tissue from the blood.
- Insulin mediated: skeletal muscle and adipose tissue that express GLUT4 upon insulin stimulaton.
- Non-insulin mediated: CNS and other tissues that always express GLUT1 receptors.
- Liver can take up glucose or release glucose.

### Insulin Facilitates Glucose Uptake

- Facilitated diffusion
- Hexose transporters: GLUT4 (major transporter in muscles, adipose).
- Absence of insulin: GLUT4 stored in cytoplasmic vesicles and not expressed on the cell membrane.
- Action of insulin: fusion of vesicles and insertion of glucose transporters in plasma membrane.

---

# Hexose Transporters

- Large integral membrane proteins.
- All similar structures:
1. 12 membrane-spanning regions.
2. Cytoplasmic C-terminal tail.
3. Cytoplasmic N-terminal tail.
4. Glycosylated on 1 of extracellular loops.
    
    ![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 15.35.15.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_15.35.15.png)
    
- GLUT-1 is the most common glucose transporter expressed and is responsible for Non-Insulin mediated Glucose Disposal
- GLUT1, 2 and 4 are the most important to focus on

### Insulin Stimulates Hepatic Glycogen Storage

- Activates hexokinase: phosphorylates glucose to form G-6-P, trapping it in cells after it has influxed via GLUT4 (also expressed in Higher [ ] due to Insulin).
- Activates enzymes directly involved in glycogen synthesis to prevent glucose increasing cytoplasmic tonicity which can lead to cell lysis via osmotic water influx: phosphofructokinase and glycogen synthase.
- Glycogen granules are not osmotically active and hence, do not increase cytoplasmic tonicity
- Inhibits activity of glucose-6 phosphatase: converts glucose-6- phosphate back to glucose.
- Net effect: insulin tells liver to store as much glucose as possible for later use in the form of Glycogen.

---

# Glucose Flux

### Fed State

- Insulin is secreted.
- Inhibits glycogen breakdown and gluconeogenesis.
- ‚Üë glucose uptake into muscle as Glycogen and adipose tissue as fat ‚Üí 85% of this glucose disposal is insulin mediated (Adipose Tissue and Muscle).

### Fasting State

- Glucagon is secreted and insulin is inhibited.
- Glycogen breakdown (liver) and gluconeogenesis (kidney) to increase Blood [Glucose].
- Glucose is diverted to supply brain due to reduced insulin mediated glucose disposal (Reduced Uptake into Adipose Tissue and Muscle) to prioritise Cerebral Metabolism.

---

# Glycogen Metabolism

### Glycogen Synthase and Glycogen Phosphorylase

- Both enzymes can be converted between active and less active forms using a system of protein kinases.
- PKA phosphorylates and activates PKB, which activates GP.
- PKA phosphorylates and inactivates GS, which prevents cycling of glucose-1-P from Glycogen to Glucose-1-P.
- Activity of PKA leads to glycogen breakdown

### Glycogen Synthase/Glycogen Phosphorylase Coordination

- Insulin: phosphatases activates glycogen synthase and inhibits glycogen phosphorylase by dephosphorylation.
- This causes system to manufacture glycogen.
- Glucagon: kinases activate glycogen phosphorylase and inhibit glycogen synthase by phosphorylation.
- This causes system to break down glycogen.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 15.38.17.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_15.38.17.png)

.

### Net Direction of Glycogen Metabolism

- Anabolism: dephosphorylation by phosphatases (GPb) activated by insulin.
- Catabolism: phosphorylation by kinases (GPa) activated by glucagon.

---

# Effects of Glucagon and Insulin on Glycogenesis

### Glucagon Switches on Glycogen Phsophorylase

- Glucagon stimulates GPCR which activates AC:
1. ‚Üë cAMP
2. ‚Üë cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) which activates a phosphorylation cascade
3. Activates phosphorylase kinase.
4. Activates GP (glycogen phosphorylase).
- Glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb - Inactive) is converted to glycogen phosphorylase a (GPa - Active).

### Glucagon Switches off Glycogen Phosphorylase

- Glucagon acts via cAMP to switch on GPa which inhibits phosphoprotein phosphatase, which switches off glycogen synthetase as it cannot be
dephosphorylated.
- Glucagon can also switch on cAMP dependent kinase, which can phosphorylate GS to its inactive form.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 15.47.43.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_15.47.43.png)

### Insulin Switches on Glycogen Synthase

- Insulin switches on phosphoprotein phosphatase to dephosphorylate GS to activate it.
- Insulin inhibits cAMP-independent kinase so that it cannot phosphorylate GS to its inactive form.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 15.48.24.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_15.48.24.png)

### Summary

| Hormone | Action | By Activating | Net |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Insulin | Dephosphorylates | Phosphatases | Glycogen Synthesis |
| Glucagon | Phosphorylates | Kinases | Glycogen Breakdown |

# Insulin and Glucagon on the Liver

- Insulin: binds to insulin receptor and stimulates production of glycogen synthase (converting glucose to glycogen).
- Also stimulates glycolysis.
- Glucose enters through GLUT-2, and is trapped into G6P by glucokinase.
- Net result of insulin is to metabolise more glucose (glycolysis) and store more as glycogen.
- Glucagon: binds to glucagon receptor and activates glycogen phosphorylase (breaks down glycogen).
- Stimulates glucose-6- phosphatase, dephosphorylating G6P to glucose, so it can flow out of liver cell through GLUT-2 into the blood.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 15.50.05.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_15.50.05.png)

# Lipid Metabolism

### Lipid Metabolism and Insulin

- Metabolic pathways for utilisation of fats and carbohydrates are deeply and intricately intertwined.
- 2 important effects of insulin:
1. Promotes synthesis of fatty acids in liver.
2. Inhibits breakdown of fat in adipose tissue.
- Therefore, insulin has a fat-building effect.

### Lipid Metabolism

- Insulin (anabolic): ‚Üë net TAG synthesis
- Activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase to generate malonyl CoA and therefore fatty acids.
- Inactivates hormone-sensitive lipase HSL).
- Glucagon (catabolic): stimulates net breakdown of TAG stores (spares glucose)
1. Inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
2. Activates hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL).

### Links Between Glucose and Lipid Metabolism

- Glucose metabolism linked to lipogenesis.
- Pyruvate enters citric acid cycle: citrate can exit for FA biosynthesis (role for acetyl-CoA).
- Glycolysis generates ùõº-phospho glycerate: backbone of TAG
- Pentose phosphate pathway: generates ‚Üì cofactors for FA biosynthesis

### Glucagon Switches Off Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase

- Glucagon switches on cAMP dependent kinase which inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase by phosphorylation

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 15.52.16.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_15.52.16.png)

### Insulin Switches On Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase

- Insulin activates phosphoprotein phosphotase and turns inactive phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase into active, dephosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
- Insulin also inhibits cAMP-independent kinase which normally inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 15.52.55.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_15.52.55.png)

### HSL and Futile Cycling

- Hormone sensitive lipase is an enzyme that sits in adipose tissue.
- Its job is to take TAG and break them down into fatty acids and glycerol.
- Insulin inhibits HSL: high insulin levels lead to inhibition of breakdown of fat stores in adipose tissue
- During starvation, glucagon activates cAMP-dependent kinase which activates HSL to generate fatty acids and glycerol.
- Glucocorticoids is secreted under stressful conditions and activates HSL leading to breakdown of fat.

# Insulin Secretion Is Triggered by Amino Acids

1. Amino Acids are transported into the Cell via Amino Acid Transporters
2. Amino Acids are then converted into Pyruvate, which is then metabolised in the Krebs Cycle like Glucose 
3. This increased ATP:ADP, closing the KATP Channel, which reduces K‚Å∫ Efflux and hence, causes Depolarisation
4. This opens Voltage Gated Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Channels, mediating Ca¬≤‚Å∫ Influx to increase Intracellular [Ca¬≤‚Å∫] to stimulate Insulin Release

![Screenshot 2022-01-21 at 00.18.41.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-21_at_00.18.41.png)

---

# Glucagon-Amino Acid Feedback Loop

- Glucagon Secretion is also activated by Amino Acids via an mTOR mediated mechanism
- Amino Acids stimulate Glucagon Secretion which increases the rate of oxidation of Amino Acids in the Liver to regulate Blood [Amino Acid]
- Increasing the rate of Amino Acid oxidation increases production of Ammonia (Metabolised into Urea) and Glucose (via Gluconeogenesis, using the Amino Acid Carbon Skeleton)

![Screenshot 2022-01-21 at 00.19.44.png](%5B004%5D%20The%20Normal%20Endocrine%20Pancreas%20dabb55ac0000410a8c706a89c6de437b/Screenshot_2022-01-21_at_00.19.44.png)

# After A Protein-Rich Meal

- Increased [Amino Acid] causes increased release of Insulin and Glucagon
- Increased Insulin signalling increases Glycogenesis to increase Glucose Uptake and reduce Blood [Glucose]
- Increased Glucagon signalling increases Glycogenolysis and Gluconeogenesis (via increasing AA Oxidation), increasing Glucose Output into the Blood
- Therefore, the effects of Insulin and Glucagon cancel each other out to produce a negligible/no effect on Blood [Glucose]
