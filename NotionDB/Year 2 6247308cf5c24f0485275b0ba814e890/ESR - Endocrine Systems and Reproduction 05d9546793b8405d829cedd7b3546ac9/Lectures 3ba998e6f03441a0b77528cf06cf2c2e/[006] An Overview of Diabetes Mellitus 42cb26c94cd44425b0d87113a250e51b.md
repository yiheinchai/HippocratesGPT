# [006] An Overview of Diabetes Mellitus

Progress: Not started

# Diabetes Mellitus

- Metabolic disorder of multiple aetiologies:
1. Chronic hyperglycaemia
2. Disturbance of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism.
- Resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or both.
- Type I diabetes: Autoimmune condition resulting in destruction of pancreatic ùõΩ cells. There is a lack of insulin.
- Type II diabetes: insulin resistance, but also defective insulin secretion as a result of pancreatic ùõΩ cell dysfunction. There is a relative lack of insulin.
- Other types of diabetes: Monogenic Diabetes (Due to genetic defects), gestational diabetes, pancreatic (affected by disease, tumour or surgical removal of the pancreas), endocrine (Cushing‚Äôs syndrome, acromegaly), drugs (corticosteroids) or other genetic syndromes.
- DM is a continuum with ùõΩ cell failure at one end and insulin resistance (failure of Insulin Activity) at other.
- Each type of diabetes sits somewhere on continuum, where each type has aspects of both, so that they all have a component of insulin resistance and lack of Insulin secretion.
- In Monogenic Diabetes, there is more pronounced reduced Insulin Production than Insulin Resistance
- Diseases of absolute right hand side are rare, as these are diseases with defect
to insulin receptor so it is no longer responsive to Insulin (Insulin Resistance end) and Beta Cell Failure (Type 1 Diabetes).

# Who Gets Diabetes?

- Incidence is increasing in all age groups.
- A large proportion of individuals who have diabetes are unaware of this
- Inequalities in ethnic distribution: Those from Africa, Indian sub-continent and Chine are at ‚Üë risk.
- Most common endocrine disease

# Symptoms and Diagnosis

### Signs and Symptoms

- Weight loss
- Polydipsia (drinking more than normal).
- Polyuria (urinating more than normal).
- Lethargy and general malaise.
- Recurrent infections
- In T2DM there are often no symptoms and majority of above refer to T1DM.

### Diagnosis

- Symptomatic: fasting plasma ‚â• 7 mmol/L, random plasma glucose ‚â• 11.1 mmol/L or 2 hour OGTT ‚â• 11.1 mmol/L.
- Asymptomatic: 2 of above to diagnose DM.
- HbA1c: ‚â• 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) (normal is 4-6%) ‚Üí Identified via High Pressure Liquid Chromatography
- HbA1c < 42 mmol/mol and HbA1c reflects average blood glucose over 90 days (determined by lifespan of RBC).
- Erythrocytes (contain haemoglobin) are exposed to glucose in plasma.
- Glucose enters via GLUT-1, and if not used up via glycolysis, it accumulates in the Erythrocyte cytoplasm where it non-enzymatically glycosylates HbA to form HbA1C.
- This occurs at N-terminus of ùõΩ chain.
- ‚Üë [glucose] ‚Üë the rate of glycosylation of Hb and increases [HbA1c].
- There are 2 main types of Prediabetes, Impaired Glucose Tolerance/IGT and Impaired Fasting Glycaemic/IFG, which indicate an increased risk of Diabetes
- Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): state of impaired glucose regulation.
- Fasting plasma glucose: < 7.0 mmol/L.
- 75g OGTT 2 hour value: 7.8 < ùë• < 11.1.
- Impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG):
- Fasting plasma glucose: 6.1 < ùë• < 7.0 mmol/L.
- OGTT needed to exclude diabetes.
- IGT and IFG both ‚Üë risk of CVD regardless of whether patient has diabetes or not.
- 2.5% of patients with IGT will progress to diabetes/year.
- Px with HbA1c = 42-47 mmol/mol have Prediabetes
- Early treatment may ‚Üì progression (healthy eating advice, weight management, exercise, Metformin (useful but less effective)).
- Annual OGTT and HbA1c to diagnose diabetes.

# Goals of Diabetes Management

1. Manage symptoms
2. Prevent acute and late complications (most important).
3. Improve quality of life due to chronicity of disease.
4. Avoid premature diabetes-associated death.
5. Provide an individualised approach to allow the Px to live their life normally with diabetes.

---

# Chronic Complications of Diabetes

- Retinopathy: vessel in eye narrow and cause blindness.
- Most common cause of blindness in people of working age.
- Nephropathy: vessels in kidney start shutting off causing renal failure.
- 16% of all new patients needing renal replacement therapy have diabetes.
- Erectile dysfunction due to vasculopathy: may affect up to 50% of men with longstanding diabetes.
- Erectile Dysfunction is used as a marker of increased risk of CVD
- Macrovascular (E.g Coronary Artery Disease) and cerebrovascular disease: 2-3 fold ‚Üë risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.
- Foot problems: 15% of people with diabetes develop foot ulcers.
- 5-15% of people with diabetic foot ulcers need amputations.
- Better controlled diabetes = Fewer Complications

---

# Type II Diabetes Mellitus

- Most common type of Diabetes
- Usually occurs in individuals >30 years although ‚Üë seen in younger populations.
- Typical patient is generally overweight or obese; symptoms are insidious and vary in intensity.
- T2DM is characterised by insulin resistance with ùõΩ cell malfunction.
- 4% of UK population have T2DM, more than 10% in people >65 and 6-8% in ethnic minorities particularly those of Asian origin.
- It is strongly linked to obesity

---

# Treatment of Type II Diabetes Mellitus

- Diet and exercise: Very Low Calorie Diets
- Weight loss: bariatric surgery (Roux-en Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy most commonly done)
- Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is where the Stomach is separated into a Proximal Pouch that is directly connected to the SI so that food travels immediately into the SI
- Sleeve Gastrectomy involves reducing the size of the stomach to reduce the quantity of food that can be eaten before satiety is triggered
- Bariatric Surgery is the only form of treatment currently that allows for the short term management of Diabetes and Blood Glucose Levels without the need for additional drugs
- This is likely due to the weight loss associated with the surgery which alters metabolism to prevent hyperglycaemia and maintain normal insulin signalling

- Oral hypoglycaemic agents:
1. Sulphonylureas, metformin, gliptins, thiazolidinediones, gliflozins: ‚Üì blood glucose.
2. GLP-1 analogues: stimulates insulin secretion.
- Insulin therapy: necessary for those with severe ùõΩ cell malfunctions.

### Mechanisms of Action

1. Increase Insulin Secretion
2. Increase Insulin Sensitivity of Muscle
3. Increase Peripheral Glucose Uptake and Utilisation in Muscle and Adipose Tissue
4. Reduced Glucose Production by the Liver
5. Increase Renal Glucose Disposal/Excretion by blocking Renal Glucose Reabsorption
6. Reduce Glucose Intestinal Absorption
- Metformin increases Peripheral Glucose Uptake and Metabolism whilst also Reducing Hepatic Glucose Production (One of the Main Drugs Used)
- Thiazolidinediones ‚Üí Peripheral Insulin Sensitiser

# Type II Diabetes Care Strategy

| Advice | Exercise, health eating diet, no smoking (to reduce CVD Risk) regular testing and education |
| --- | --- |
| BP | Aim < 140/80 mmHg to prevent Retinopathy and Nephropathy |
| Cholesterol | Statin Treatment to lower [Cholesterol] |
| Drugs | Aspirin or ACEi to reduce CVD Risk and BP respectively |
| Eyes | Check Yearly |
| Feet | Check Yearly |
| Glycaemia | Aim HbA1c c ‚â• 6.5% |
- Driving HbA1c < 6.5% causes patient to die faster.
- This is because with intensive treatment, patients tend to become hypoglycaemic.
- Low blood sugar kills you faster than high blood sugar, so aim for 6.5-7.5%.

---

# Monitoring Glycaemic Control

- Home BG monitors: spot readings are rapid (3s) and measure capillary blood.
- This is commonly done to hypoglycaemia associated with Insulin Therapy
- HbA1c measurement: long term as it gives average blood glucose for last 90 days.
- Fructosamine (Glycated Albumin): medium-term. Used in patients with mutated haemoglobin as HbA1c measurements here are not reliable.

---

# Type I Diabetes Mellitus

- Usually occurs in individuals <30 years but can occur in Individuals 30-50 years (Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of the Adult/LADA).
- Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic ùõΩ cell, which ‚Üì amount of insulin produced/released.
- Without insulin, ketogenesis occurs and ketoacidosis results in death.
- Genetic susceptibility and environmental factors (E.g Viruses), when combined with an autoimmune attack result in destruction of ùõΩ cell and thus T1DM.

---

# Treatment of Type I Diabetes (Insulin)

- It needs to be injected as if it is taken orally, it will be metabolised in the stomach (as it is a peptide) and won‚Äôt be absorbed into the blood in an active form
- 1-3 injections/day of same insulin.
- 4-5 injections/day of different insulins.
- Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump.
- Insulin can also be administered in an inhaled form but this is less popular

# Insulin and Insulin Analogues

### Insulin

- Discovered in 1921 by Banting and Best.
- 2 chains (A and B).
- Proinsulin
- Available as:
1. Bovine/porcine insulin ‚Üí Used to be used.
2. Human insulin: extracted from yeast containing recombinant insulin gene.
3. Insulin analogues ‚Üí Used Now.

### Insulin Analogues

- Human insulin tends to aggregate to form hexamer crystals, causing a delay in its action when it is administered
- Insulin analogues (Similar Structure to Insulin) were created to alter pharmacokinetics to alter their onset .
- Insulin Aspart: rapid acting as they do not hexamerise but still stimulate the Insulin Receptor (Often used before a meal to prevent Postprandial Hyperglycaemia).
- Insulin Degludec: ultra-slow acting and longer lasting as it contains an additional FA Chain which allows it to bind to Albumin and form insoluble depots under the skin.
- Insulin Degludec is used for Px who require 24 hr Insulin Therapy to allow for continuous Blood Sugar Control
- These are often used in combination to provide a constant and continuous Blood [Glucose]
- These analogues are very expensive as they are patented and hence, where costs of Insulin are not subsidised (E.g USA), Insulin is very expensive, to the point where some people cannot afford it and have Unmanaged Diabetes
- Insulin Regiments are tailor-made to the Px, based on a wide range of factors such as diet, lifestyle and previous complications with Diabetes (E.g Hypoglycaemic Episodes)

# Gestational Diabetes Mellitus

- Diabetes that arises during pregnancy and resolves after delivery of baby.
- ‚Üë risk of T2DM and hypertension in  future.
- Can cause macrosomia (Large Baby, meaning Vaginal Birth becomes difficult/impossible), respiratory distress and early delivery of foetus.
- It is also associated with Neonatal Hypoglycaemia, where Baby and their metabolic rate becomes acclimatised to Hyperglycaemic Maternal Blood.
- After birth, High Metabolic Rate and lack of delivery of Maternal Hyperglycaemic Blood causes a pronounced Hypoglycaemic Episode
- Risk factors: obesity, family history,  T2DM (Or increased risk of Diabetes ), previous GDM.
- Treatment: insulin, metformin.

---

# Monogenic Diabetes

- Develops at an early stage (<25 yrs) and has a different genetic background to type II DM, as it is monogenic.
- A strong family history correlates to risk of Monogenic Diabetes and it is autosomal dominant.
- Multiple Genes have been identified that cause Diabetes, with more being discovered
- Most of these Genes are Transcription Factors (Involved in Beta Cell Development), Amino Acid and Ion Channels and Glucokinase
- CFTR Mutations can also cause Monogenic Diabetes as it is involved in Insulin Sensitivity
- Mitochondrial Genes can also lead to Monogenic Diabetes
- Therefore, Causative Genes are involved in Beta Cell Production, Glucose Metabolism (Both Glycolytic and Mitochondrial) and Glucose Sensing
- Different from T2DM.
- Patients do not have autoimmunity, simply a gene defects which affects insulin release.
- Usually Rx via Diet or Tablet instead of Insulin

# Other Types of Diabetes

| Types of Diabetes | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| Pancreatic | Surgery, Pancreatitis, Cystic Fibrosis |
| Endocrinopathies | Cushing‚Äôs Syndrome, Acromegaly |
| Drugs | Glucocorticoids, Thiazide Diuretics, Œ≤ Blockers and Statins |
| Other Genetic Syndromes | Myotonic Dystrophy, DiDMOAD, Insulin Resistance Syndromes |
