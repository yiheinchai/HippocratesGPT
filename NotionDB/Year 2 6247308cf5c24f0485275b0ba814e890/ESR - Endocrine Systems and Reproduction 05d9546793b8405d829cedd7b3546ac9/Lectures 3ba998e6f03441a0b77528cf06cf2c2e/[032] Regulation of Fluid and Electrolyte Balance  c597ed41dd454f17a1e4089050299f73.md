# [032] Regulation of Fluid and Electrolyte Balance by Aldosterone and AVP - Diabetes Insipidus

Progress: In progress

# Vasopressin Structure

- 9 amino acid peptide hormone.
- Similar to oxytocin, both are 1.1 kDa nonapeptides.
- Differ in only 2 amino acid residues (position 3 and 8).

# AVP Synthesis

- Magnocellular neurones in supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus synthesise vasopressin, extending down to the posterior pituitary via the Supraoptic Hypothalamic Tract.
- Packaged into neurosecretory granules with neurophysin.
- Parvocellular neurones also synthesise vasopressin along with CRH, which regulates the HPA Axis.
- This AVP potentiates CRH stimulation of ACTH release from anterior pituitary.
- Thus, some AVP secretion even if Supra-Optic tract is damaged.
- Released from nerve terminals in posterior pituitary gland and enters inferior hypophyseal circulation via fenestrated capillaries.

# AVP and Plasma Volume

### Decreased Plasma Volume

1. Plasma Volume Decreases (Hypovolaemia)
2. Reduced Firing of Baroreceptors (Systemic Venous Baroreceptors in the LA and Systemic Arterial Baroreceptors in the Carotid Sinus and Aortic Arch) 
3. Reduced firing of Baroreceptive Information down CN IX and X to the Hypothalamus
4. Reduced Inhibition of Magnocellular Neurons via α-AR
5. Increased Secretion of AVP

### Increased Plasma Osmolality

1. Increased Plasma Osmolarity
2. Increased ECF Osmolality and hence, Osmotic Movement of Water from Cells into the ECF
3. This causes Osmotic Cell Shrinkage
4. This increases the Firing Rate of Hypothalamic and Non-Hypothalamic Osmoreceptors
5. Increased Stimulation of Magnocellular Neurons in the Paraventricular Nucleus
6. Increased Secretion of AVP/ADH/Vasopressor from the Posterior Pituitary Gland
- ADH is secreted in response to Hypovolaemia and Plasma Hyperosmolality to increase Water Reuptake into the Plasma to restore Normovolaemia and Normal Plasma Osmolality

---

# Influence of Plasma Volume

- Osmolality is more effective than Plasma Volume (via RAAS) at stimulating ADH Release but these effects will synergise so that ADH Release when there is Plasma Hyperosmolality and Hypovolaemia is greater than the additive ADH Release associated with the same degree of Hyperosmolality and Hypovolaemia are seen independently
- Plasma volume must decrease > 8% to trigger ADH Secretion
- Secretion of ADH with decreasing blood volume shows an exponential relationship:
- ↓ 15% in plasma volume = ↑ 2X [AVP]
- ­↓ 20% plasma volume = ↑­ 4X [AVP]
- Osmolality is more effective than plasma volume in stimulating ADH Secretion as small changes in Osmolality cause a large change ADH Secretion whilst large changes in Plasma Volume are needed to produce a large change in ADH Secretion
- ­↑ 2% plasma osmolality = ↑ 35% [AVP]
- ­↑ 4% plasma osmolality = ↓­ 3.5X [AVP]

# Actions of AVP

- 2 distinct actions via different GPCRs:
1. Pressor action: via V1 receptors.
2. ADH is release when ↓ GFR and helps maintain BP with ↓ plasma volume and increase GFR to within the Normal Limits.
3. Anti-diuretic action: via V2 receptors. cAMP stimulates insertion of aquaporin AP2 water channels in Apical Membrane of renal collecting ducts and longer term ↑ expression of AP2 and AP3 on the Basolateral Surface leading to prolonged dehydration.
- Need AVP (arginine vasopressin) for Na⁺ driven water reabsorption to maintain water permeability of Collecting Duct so that water reabsorption can follow Na⁺ reabsorption osmotically.
- t1/2 in plasma is approximately 5 min so ADH provides short term regulation of salt and water balance (predominantly osmolality regulation)
- Long-term regulation of salt and water balance (especially blood volume) also involves aldosterone with t1/2 of approximately 20 min and dependent on
gene expression

### Antidiuretic Action of AVP on Water Permeability of Cells in the DCT and Collecting Duct

- AVP binds to V2 receptor
- Activates AC to produce cAMP
- cAMP activates protein kinase A which will phosphorylate preformed aquaporins AP2 within Secretory Granules which translocate to luminal membrane.
- This increases the water permeability of the Apical Membrane of the Collecting Duct, increasing water reabsorption from the Tubular Fluid via Osmosis, which Osmoses across the Basolateral Membrane into the Blood via AP3 or AP4
- In the Short Term, translocation/movement of AP2 only maintained for 5 mins after stimulation of V2 via ADH
- In the Long Term, expression of AP2 and AP3 on the Apical Membrane is maintained following V2 Stimulation for 24 hrs.

# Control of Vasopressin Secretion

- Increased AT2 Secretion acts synergistically with Plasma Hyperosmolality to significantly increase the magnitude of ADH Released
- AT2 can enter the Hypothalamus directly or indirectly through the OVLT Sub-Fornical Organ (Organum Vasculosum of the Lamina Terminalis) to stimulate Hypothalamic Osmoreceptors
- This causes Increased Thirst to stimulate increased Dietary Fluid Intake in an attempt to increase the volume of Tubular Filtrate and hence, water that can be reabsorbed to correct Plasma Osmolality

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 08.43.22.png](%5B032%5D%20Regulation%20of%20Fluid%20and%20Electrolyte%20Balance%20%20c597ed41dd454f17a1e4089050299f73/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_08.43.22.png)

# Diabetes Insipidus

- It is characterised by Polyuria (with decreased urine osmolality) and Polydipsia (Ensure Polydipsia is not psychogenic in cause), due to defective ADH Signalling
- Increased plasma renin and aldosterone due to hypovolemic hypotension stimulating the RAAS
- There are 2 types of Diabetes Insipidus:
- Cranial = Defect in AVP synthesis and/or secretion
- Nephrogenic = Defective V2 receptor expression so Px becomes ADH Resistant
- Head injury with damage to posterior pituitary /supra-optic hypothalamic tract often results in cranial DI as whilst AVP is still being produced in the Hypothalamus, Paraventricular Axons are damaged and hence, AVP cannot reach nerve terminals in the Posterior Pituitary where it is released from
- However, Plasma AVP is not 0 as AVP is co-secreted with CRH Parvocellular Neurons and hence, are not damaged when the Supraoptic Hypothalamic Tract is damaged

### Treatment

- AVP analogues (desmopressin) for Cranial DI to increase V2 stimulation back to normal levels
- Extracellular fluid volume contraction (low Na⁺ diet and natriuretic thiazide diuretics), with potential K⁺ replacement for nephrogenic DI.

---

# Vasopressin Hypersecretion

- AVP hypersecretion associated with hypervolemic hypertension and potentially fatal hyponatremia (due to increased water reabsorption without associated nutrient reabsorption causing dilution/hypoosmolarity of the blood)
- This is seen in Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) where Increased ADH secretion causes excessive water retention
- Causes:
1. Intra-cranial trauma/infection
2. Pneumonia
3. Malignant disease (small lung cell cancer, other carcinoma that secrete ADH)
4. Selected narcotics/analgesics (nicotine, surgery)
5. Prolonged strenuous exercise (marathon, hot weather training)

---

# Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH Secretion

- Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disturbance seen in SIADH (Seen in 1/3rd of all cases)
- Treatments
1. Fluid restriction → Reduce Tubular Fluid Volume to reduce the amount of water available for reabsorption
2. Hypertonic saline → Increases Sodium content of Blood to correct Hyponatraemia
3. Urea 
4. Lithium (Inhibits AP Activity to prevent Increased Water Reabsorption)
5. Demeclocycline (antibiotic, inhibits cAMP downsteam of the V2R to prevent insertion of AP2 into the Apical Membrane of the Collecting Duct and hence, reduce water reabsorption)
6. Vasopressin 2 receptor antagonists (vaptans) to reduce V2 Stimulation by ADH and hence, AP2 insertion and water reabsorption

---

# RAAS

1. Hypotension reduces Renal Perfusion Pressure, which causes Increased Renin Release from the JGA
2. Increased Renin increases conversion of Angiotensinogen (found in High Amounts in the Circulation) into Angiotensin I in the Circulation
3. ACE converts AT1 into AT2
4. AT2 then stimulates Aldosterone Synthesis in the Adrenal Cortex, with Aldosterone increasing Renal K⁺ Secretion to allow for Increased Na⁺ resorption
5. Hypotension (via reduced Baroreceptor Firing) stimulates increased ADH Release from the Posterior Pituitary Gland
6. ADP increases CCD water permeability to increase Water Resorption, increasing BP and hence, increasing Renal Perfusion pressure back to normal levels

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 08.48.53.png](%5B032%5D%20Regulation%20of%20Fluid%20and%20Electrolyte%20Balance%20%20c597ed41dd454f17a1e4089050299f73/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_08.48.53.png)

- Hyponatraemia causes reduced [Na⁺] in the Tubular Filtrate, stimulating Renin Release from the JGA
- Renin Release increases conversion of Angiotensinogen into AT1, which is converted into AT2 via ACE
- AT2 directly stimulates Aldosterone Synthesis within the Adrenal Cortex to increase Renal K⁺ Secretion to allow for Increased Na⁺ Resorption, Increasing [Na⁺] In the Plasma to bring [Na⁺] back to normal levels

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 08.49.18.png](%5B032%5D%20Regulation%20of%20Fluid%20and%20Electrolyte%20Balance%20%20c597ed41dd454f17a1e4089050299f73/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_08.49.18.png)

- Hyperkalaemia directly stimulates Aldosterone Synthesis by the Adrenal Cortex
- Aldosterone acts to increase Renal K⁺ Secretion to lower Plasma [K⁺] back to Normal Levels
- Increased Renal K⁺ Secretion also increases Na⁺ Resorption and hence causes Hypernatraemia
- This Hypernatraemia/Increased Plasma Osmolality stimulates ADH Secretion, increasing the CCD Water Permeability
- This causes Increased Water Resorption in the Plasma which dilutes the blood to normalise Plasma Osmolality and hence, Decrease [K⁺] back to Normal Levels

# Control of Aldosterone Secretion

- The RAAS is activated by:
1. ↓ Na⁺ in the Tubular Filtrate, sensed by the macula densa of distal tubule
2. Increased Sympathetic nervous activity.
3. ↓ mean transmural pressure across the Glomerulus (Renal Perfusion Pressure)
- Angiotensin II ↑ drinking behaviour and ↑ aldosterone secretion which ↑ stimulation of mineralocorticoid receptor to ↑ renal Na⁺ retention and K⁺ excretion. This is long term control.

# Regulation of Sodium

- Most abundant cation in ECF and is responsible for the majority of Plasma Osmolality (Na⁺ Salts contribute 280 of 300 mOsm)
- Only cation exerting significant osmotic pressure and hence, influencing plasma volume
- Controls ECF volume and water distribution
- Changes in Na⁺ levels affects plasma volume, blood pressure, ECF and ICF volumes
- Regardless of aldosterone presence (obligate resorption):
1. 65% Na⁺ reabsorbed in proximal tubules
2. 25% is reabsorbed in nephron loops
- Therefore, a large proportion of Water Reabsorption is independent of Aldosterone Activity, with only 10% of Water Reabsorption being due to Aldosterone Activity on the CCD
- This means that Aldosterone is involved in Fine Tuning Water Resorption Vs Bulk Resorption (Hence, why Aldosterone is mainly regulated by Electrolyte Balance vs Plasma Volume as its main role is fine tuned regulation of Electrolyte [ ] by fine tuning water reabsorption vs facilitating the majority of water reabsorption)
- Na⁺ is never secreted into tubular filtrate and hence, only reabsorbed
- Water movement in filtrate follows the  Na⁺ osmotically (if ADH is present as this allows for the Na⁺-Permeable CCD to become water permeable)
- Na⁺ in urine (Due to reduced Water Reabsorption) → Increased Water Retention in Urine → ­water loss/Osmotic diuresis

# Actions of Aldosterone on Cells of the Renal Distal Tubule and Other Epithelia (Sweat, Salivary Glands and Colon) - HERE

- Aldosterone binds to cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptor within Principal Cells of the CCD which translocates to nucleus and induces gene expression of:
1. SGK1 which activates Basolateral Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase (Establishes -ve Vm which drives Na⁺ reabsorption via its Electrogenic Activity → Net Cation Efflux into the Plasma as 3Na⁺ are effluxed in exchange for 2K⁺ which are influxed) and Apical ROMK (Allows for K⁺ Efflux into the Tubular Lumen).
2. ENaC (epithelium Na⁺ channel) which is translocated to luminal membrane which  ↑ membrane permeability to Na⁺ to allow for Na⁺ reabsorption
- Aldosterone is important in Warm Climates and Endurance Activity where it increases Salt Appetite to prevent Hyponatraemia due to excessive sweating

---

# Hypoaldosteronism

- Addison’s disease → autoimmune or infectious destruction of adrenal tissue associated with TB and HIV
- CAH (21 Hydroxylase or 11-β-Hydroxylase deficiencies meaning that Aldosterone cannot be synthesised within the Zona Glomerulosa)
- Symptoms
1. Hyponatremia and Hyperkalemia
2. Fatigue
3. Weakness
4. Hypotension - Key Sx as other Sx are very general
- This is not due to acute decrease in ACTH as whilst High ACTH can increase Aldosterone Synthesis, Low ACTH does not decrease Aldosterone Synthesis (Aldosterone Synthesis is ACTH-Sensitive but not ACTH-Dependent) → Aldosterone is mainly regulated by BP, Na⁺ and K⁺ Levels

---

# Pseudohypoaldosteronism

- Symptoms = Natriuresis and Anti-kaliuresis
- Symptoms = Hyponatremia and Hyperkalemia
- ­­­↑ Plasma renin activity in an attempt to increase Aldosterone Signalling
- ↑ [Aldosterone] due to Raised Renin
- This is causes by a mutation to the Mineralocorticoid Receptor so that it cannot be stimulated by Aldosterone (Aldosterone Resistance)

---

# Conn’s Syndrome

- Primary hyperaldosteronism due to Cortical Tumour of the Adrenals - This is rare
- Increased secretion of aldosterone due to over-expression of steroidogenic enzymes and/or expansion of Z.glomerulosa
- Kaliuresis / anti-natriuresis (Hypokalaemia and Hypernatraemia)
- Increased Fluid resorption due to raised Aldosterone and increased Na⁺ Reabsorption - hypervolaemic hypertension

---

# Mineralocorticoid Excess - Overactivation of MR

- Causes:
- Primary – low renin, high aldosterone
1. Conn’s syndrome
- Primary – low renin, low aldosterone
1. DOC producing tumour/CAH
2. Cushing’s syndrome (Excess Cortisol)
3. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess
- Secondary – high renin, high aldosterone
1. Chronic haemorrhage/decrease in blood volume
2. Heart failure leading to decreased GFR
- Treatments:
1. Mineralocorticoid antagonists (e.g. Spironolactone)
2. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors to lower Renin levels
3. K+ to correct Hypokalaemia

---

# Anticipated Changes in Plasma [Aldosterone] Following:

- ­­Increased in Plasma [K⁺] = **↑**
- Decrease in Plasma Volume = **↑**
- Increase in Plasma Volume = ↓
- Increase in [ACTH] = **↑**
- Decrease in [ACTH] = No Change
- Increase [Angiotensinogen] = No Change as Angiotensinogen is inactive and usually in excess in the Circulation
- Administer ACEi = ↓
- Aldosterone is ACTH-Sensitive but not ACTH-Dependent as ACTH stimulates Cytochrome Side Chain Cleavage in the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane to increase the rate of Aldosterone production but is not the main regulator of Aldosterone production

---

# Hyponatraemia

### Signs and symptoms:

1. Nausea and vomiting
2. Headache
3. Confusion
4. Loss of energy, drowsiness and fatigue
5. Restlessness and irritability
6. Muscle weakness, spasms or cramps
7. Seizures
8. Coma
- Mild Hyponatraemia is usually asymptomatic but Pronounced (often Rapid Onset) Hyponatraemia produces Sx
- These are very general Sx

### Causes

- Many possible conditions and lifestyle factors causes:
- Medications- diuretics, antidepressants, pain control
- Heart, kidney and liver disease- Congestive heart failure etc. can cause fluid accumulation, which dilutes the plasma sodium, causing [Na⁺] to drop → Hyponatraemia
- Syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH)- high ADH causes water retention
- Chronic, severe vomiting or diarrhoea and other causes of dehydration- loss of electrolytes, such as sodium, and also increases ADH levels.
- Drinking too much water - excessive amounts of water can causes low sodium by overwhelming the kidneys' ability to excrete water, diluting the Plasma and hence, causing Hyponatraemia.
- Because you lose sodium through sweat, drinking too much water (which doesn’t contain Sodium) during endurance activities, such as marathons/triathlons, can dilute the sodium in the blood to cause Hyponatraemia
- Hormonal changes. Adrenal gland insufficiency (Addison’s/CAH) affects sodium, potassium and water balance. Low levels of thyroid hormone cause a low sodium.
- Recreational drugs (Amphetamine and Ecstasy) increases the risk of severe and even fatal hyponatremia as they stimulate Hyperthermia, causing Excessive Thirst which causes Px to drink lots of water very rapidly

### Prevention

1. Treat associated/underlying conditions- such as adrenal gland insufficiency
2. Patient education for Px with diuretic, anti depressant etc to ensure Na⁺ Intake is sufficient to prevent Hyponatraemia.
3. High intensity activities - replace water with sports beverages that contain electrolytes (E.g Na⁺) in endurance events and demanding activities
4. Drink water in moderation. 
- Drinking water is vital for health, so make
sure you drink enough fluids. But don't overdo it.
- Thirst and the colour of urine is usually the best indications of how much water the body needs.
- If you're not thirsty and your urine is pale yellow, you are likely getting enough water.

---

# Hypernatraemia

- Common causes:
1. insufficient fluid intake
2. too much water loss
3. in rare cases, consuming too much sodium
- Risk groups include intravenous (IV) treatments or undergoing nasogastric feeding, altered mental state and infants and older adults.
- Risk conditions: Dehydration, vomiting, extreme diarrhoea, kidney disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, dementia, fever, delirium and large areas of burned skin.
- The main symptom of hypernatremia is Polydipsia.
- Others include general Sx like fatigue and confusion, but usually no symptoms unless severe
