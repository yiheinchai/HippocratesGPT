# [015] Endocrine Aspects of Obesity

Progress: Not started

# Obesity

- Most common nutrition-related disorder in western world.
- Around 50% of all UK adults are overweight or obese and this percentage is ‚Üë.
- Becoming a much bigger problem in developing world.
- Generally most common in poor and under-educated populations as food with high nutritional value is expensive.
- Obesity ‚Üì life expectancy and ‚Üë risk of:
1. T2DM
2. CHD
3. Some types of cancer: breast, endometrial, ovarian, gall bladder, colon.
- Adipose tissue is now recognised to be an important endocrine tissue, whose secretory profile is disrupted in obesity.
- Obese individuals often suffer from metabolic syndrome, which includes central obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and mild chronic inflammation.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 18.19.23.png](%5B015%5D%20Endocrine%20Aspects%20of%20Obesity%205ad650d875854e18ad215ac69a98b28f/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_18.19.23.png)

- Lowest risk is at normal weight and risk of developing health problems increases as you become more underweight/overweight
- These classifications (underweight etc.) can differ, for example, with ethnicity/geographical origin or age.
- 25% of obese appear to be metabolically healthy.

---

# Obesity and Genetics

- Heritability of obesity (proportion of phenotypic variability attributable to genetic variation) is extremely high at moment.
- Genetic variation can also affect numerous obesity-related phenotypes:
1. Appetite regulation - Proteins involved in hunger and satiety
2. Fuel metabolism
3. Body weight distribution (Central or Peripheral).
4. Risks associated with obesity.
- Our current environment (high calorie food, sedentary lifestyle) almost guarantees that any propensity towards obesity will become manifest.

# Genetic Mouse Models of Obesity

### Lethal Yellow Mutant Mouse (Ay)

- Lethal to homozygotes. Heterozygotes have a yellow coat, mature-onset obesity, T2DM, hyperleptinaemia, tumour susceptibility.
- Mouse has ectopic expression of agouti protein, which is a result of loss of tissue-specific expression of promotor element.
- Protein is usually only expressed in follicular melanocytes, where is
antagonizes binding of ùõº-MSH to Mc1r.
- Mutation causes agouti expression in all cells, not just follicular melanocytes.
- Expression of agouti in hypothalamus chronically antagonizes Mc4r (melanocortin 4 receptor) on particular
neurons, which disrupts its function.
- These hypothalamic neurons usually act to signal satiety, but in mutant mice, agouti proteins inhibit this so mouse excessively feeds.
- Therefore, mutation in Mc4r can lead to reduced satiety and therefore, increased food intake and obesity

### Obese Mouse (Ob/Ob)

- Mutant mice gain weight rapidly at a young age, to become 3x size of control mice.
- Uncontrollable food intake, obesity, T2DM, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia
- Obese mouse does not produce leptin.
- Leptin is primarily secreted in adipocytes, where circulating leptin levels reflect body fat level.
- Usually, leptin acts in hypothalamus to depress appetite and lead to Insulin Resistance
- Obese mice injected with leptin, Mice lose weight dramatically.
- In most obese humans, leptin levels are actually high (due to higher body fat), which suggests they may have leptin resistance within the Hypothalamus rather than lack of leptin.
- This may be due to ‚Üì uptake of increased [Leptin] across the BBB by the short form receptor or resistance to the Leptin Signalling Pathways in the Hypothalamus.

### Diabetic Obese Mouse (db/db)

- Mutant mice are larger/ obese relative to heterozygous littermates by 1 month, with ‚Üë fat deposition and hyperglycaemia by 8 weeks.
- Mouse does not express long form of leptin receptor.
- Long form appears to be involved in signalling whereas short forms appear to be involved in transport.
- Phenotype is identical to obese mouse, if genetic defect is expressed on same inbred background.
- Administration of leptin to these mice cannot treat their obesity as they do not respond to leptin.

### Fat Mouse (fat/fat)

- Obesity develops relatively slowly and there is ‚Üë fat deposition.
- Mice have hyperproinsulinaemia but not hyperglycaemia and they are not prone to diabetes

---

# Diet-Induced Obesity (DIO)

### High Fat Diet (HFD)

- 58% fat, 25.6% carb, 16.4% protein with a total of 23.4kJ/g. (A standard ‚Äòchow‚Äô diet is 11.4% fat, 62.8% carb, 25.8% protein with a total of 12.6kJ/g).
- Mice fed on this diet exhibit ‚Üë weight gain, modest hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance etc.
- Used as a model of impaired glucose tolerance and early T2DM.
- When fed to mice of different strains, some strains are more resistant to DIO than others, or to particular risk factors.
- DIO is also an opportunity to evaluate effect of dietary interventions

### Cafeteria Diet (CAF)

- Standard chow + assortment of human snack items (highly palatable, energy dense) ad libitum
- This diet encourages hedonic
feeding (instead of homeostatic feeding).
- CAF-fed mice consumed 30% more calories/day (HFD ‚Üì gram intake to normalise caloric intake) and gained most weight.
- They also had worse hyperglycaemia, highest levels of plasma FFA, higher levels of infiltrating macrophages (and crown-like structures formed from Macrophage Apoptosis) and dramatically altered pancreatic islets.
- This may be a better model of metabolic syndrome than HFD diet

# Traditional View of Adipose Tissue and Insulin Signalling in Adipocytes

### Traditional View of Adipose Tissue

- **During fed state**: insulin stimulates uptake of glucose, which is used in synthesis of triacylglycerol.
- TAG stored in large droplets for later use.
- **During fasting (or exercise)**: low insulin/adrenaline stimulates lipolysis of stored TAG.
- Released NEFA (non-esterified fatty acid) enter plasma, as fuel for other tissues.

### Insulin Signalling in Adipocytes

- PI3-kinase pathway mediates many of more immediate responses to insulin, such as GLUT-4 translocation to cell membrane, glycogenesis and inhibition of lipolysis.
- This pathway shows less activity in insulin resistance (lipolysis ‚Üì insulin sensitivity).
- This means that Adipocytes have a lower ability to take up and release fat during the fed and fasting/exercise states.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 18.33.30.png](%5B015%5D%20Endocrine%20Aspects%20of%20Obesity%205ad650d875854e18ad215ac69a98b28f/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_18.33.30.png)

### Insulin Signalling in Adipocytes

- MAPK pathway mediates proliferative, mitogenic effects of insulin, such as cell proliferation.
- This pathway is unaffected by insulin resistance.
- It may have atherogenic and carcinogenic effects in hyperinsulinaemia that can arise due to Insulin Resistance in T2DM.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 18.33.54.png](%5B015%5D%20Endocrine%20Aspects%20of%20Obesity%205ad650d875854e18ad215ac69a98b28f/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_18.33.54.png)

# Brown Adipose Tissue

- Produces heat through non-shivering thermogenesis.
- NA stimulates lipolysis and FA oxidation through ùõΩ3 adrenoceptors.
- Proton gradient generated is wasted through UCP1/Thermogenin so that heat is generated but not ATP.
- This allows for rapid proton influx, increasing the rate of the ETC and other metabolic processes, generating heat via Exothermic Reactions
- BAT differs from WAT in that TAG droplets are multilocular (multiple small fat droplets), mitochondria are larger and denser and it is highly innervated by sympathetic nervous system and capillary network is denser (heat is distributed around the body via the blood).
- BAT was thought to be significant only in infants, but it has now been confirmed in adults, particularly after cold acclimation.

---

# Adipose Tissue Development

- Stem cell ‚Üí pre-adipocyte ‚Üí mature adipocyte.
- Stem cell: pluripotent, capable of differentiating into a variety of cell types.
- Pre-adipocyte: appears similar to stem cell, but committed to adipocyte lineage. Doesn‚Äôt produce adipokines (except for leptin) or enzymes needed for lipogenesis.
- Mature adipocyte: expresses enzymes for lipid transport, synthesis, insulin receptors and sensitivity. Also makes adipokines such as leptin, chemerin, adiponectin etc.

---

# PPARŒ≥ (Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Œ≥)

- Transcription factor necessary (No PPARŒ≥ = No Adipocyte formation) and sufficient (Stimulation of PPARŒ≥ = Adipocyte formation) for adipogenesis.
- ‚Üë adipogenesis is associated with smaller adipocytes, less ectopic
deposition (E.g Muscle and Liver) and improved insulin sensitivity.
- Also required for maintenance of adipocyte‚Äôs differentiation, otherwise they will lose their sensitivity to insulin.
- Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are synthetic ligands for ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùëÖùõæ to increase its activation, and have been shown to ‚Üë insulin sensitivity, lower plasma glucose and ‚Üì pro-inflammatory secretion from adipocytes.

---

# Lipodystrophies

- Clinical disorders often involve lipoatrophy, or selective loss of adipose tissue (lipolysis) from particular anatomical regions.
- May be genetic or acquired (E.g Antiretrovirals).
- Patients with lipodystrophies often have aspects of metabolic syndrome (due to inability to store body fat in Adipocytes ‚Üí In Obesity, Adipocytes may be fully saturated) such as insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia and hypertension.
- Some of lipodystrophy symptoms may be alleviated by administration of leptin or adiponectin, which are normally produced by adipocytes

---

# Familiar Partial Lipodystrophy 3 (MIM 604367)

- Progressive gradual loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue from extremities, which normally begins in puberty.
- There is also ‚Üë deposition of TAG in skeletal muscle and liver instead of adipose tissue.
- Patients have hypertriglyceridaemia (Increased VLDL Synthesis), low HDL, severe insulin resistance leading to diabetes and other metabolic irregularities.
- This form of lipodystrophy is caused by mutations of PPARG gene, which codes for ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùëÖùõæ.
- Haploinsufficiency mechanism:
1. There is one non-functional allele so that only 50% of functional gene product is expressed. 
- Normal effects of ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùëÖùõæ on gene expression are greatly ‚Üì.
- For some proteins, if one allele is dysfunctional, the transcription of the other allele is upregulated to maintain normal protein levels, meaning Haploinsufficiency doesn‚Äôt occur
- Dominant-negative mechanism:
1. Faulty copy is expressed and translocates to nucleus where it interacts with ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùëÖùõæ binding partners to inhibit activity/expression of wild-type.
2. OR binds to DNA binding sites, but does not ‚Üë expression (does not recruit necessary TFs), and outcompetes wild-type ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùëÖùõæ.

---

# PPARùú∏ Mutations May Also Cause Obesity

- ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùëÖùõæ2 stimulates differentiation of pre-adipocytes to adipocytes.
- Phosphorylation of Ser114 inhibits its activity
- Pro115Gln mutation disrupts the consensus phosphorylation site for MAPK, meaning it cannot be phosphorylated.
- Mutant ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùëÖùõæ2 is overactive, resulting in greater differentiation of adipocytes.
- Affected have substantially greater obesity than rest of test subjects (BMI of up to 47.3) but lower fasting insulin levels (better metabolic health as they had more mature adipocytes)

---

# Distribution of Adipose Tissue

- Adipocyte tissue includes adipocytes (mainly), vascular tissue and immune cells.
- Largest depot in most individuals is subcutaneous adipose tissue.
- Adipokine secretion by various depots is under investigation.
- Most important 2 are subcutaneous and visceral depots.
- Widely believed to have different effects on human health, with visceral
AT seen as more harmful, and subcutaneous as possible protective or less harmful.
- Within BMI Categories, central obesity can greatly vary, with Central Obesity and Waste Circumference being positively correlated with increased risk for Diabetes, CVD etc.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 18.39.54.png](%5B015%5D%20Endocrine%20Aspects%20of%20Obesity%205ad650d875854e18ad215ac69a98b28f/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_18.39.54.png)

---

# Visceral Adipose Tissue

- Size of visceral adipocytes correlates more closely with measures of metabolic health than those of subcutaneous AT, suggesting that Visceral Adipocytes play a more important role than Subcutaneous Adipocytes in metabolic health.
- VAT products drain directly into portal vein, to liver.
- VAT is hyperlipolytic, resistant to insulin signalling, sensitive to adrenaline ‚Üí This means it is more sensitive to signals stimulating FA Release than FA Synthesis.
- Therefore, it releases more fatty acids (5-10% of FA in portal vein in lean, 50% in obese).
- This affects liver metabolism, by interfering with insulin signalling (possibly via protein kinase C) ‚Üí liver insulin resistance.
- Insulin resistance in liver causes it to ‚Üë production of VLDL, and glucose (reduced inhibition of gluconeogenesis).

---

# Adipocyte Size

- In response to increased Fat, Adipocytes may ‚Üë in diameter by 20x, but adipogenesis can also ‚Üë number of adipocytes available.
- Hyperplasia (‚Üë cell number) is healthy way to ‚Üë TAG storage capacity.
- Hypertrophy (‚Üë cell size) is associated with several problems.
- In small adipocytes, adipokines secreted are anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitising.
- In large adipocytes, adipokines are pro-inflammatory and insulin-desensitising.
- There is ‚Üë necrosis and reduced Apoptosis amongst larger adipocytes, which leads to ‚Üë macrophage recruitment to phagocytose cellular debris.

---

# Adipokines

- Adipose tissue is now known to release a huge number of adipokines (may be more than 600) ‚Üí These are cytokines secreted by Adipocytes.
- It is now believed that many conditions associated with obesity are mediated by changes in adipokine secretion that occur as obesity progresses.
- Adipokines may act at autocrine and paracrine levels, with both central and peripheral effects.
- Adipokine levels have now shown to be linked to a wide range of conditions such as hypertension, CVD, insulin resistance.

---

# Leptin and Leptin Resistance

### Leptin

- Leptin is an adipokine protein secreted by mature adipocytes.
- Receptors for leptin are concentrated in feeding centres of hypothalamus, but also in peripheral tissues.
- Leptin secretion ‚Üë with body fat and fluctuates in response to feeding (in response to Insulin Levels), where it ‚Üë with overfeeding and ‚Üì with fasting.
- Leptin ‚Üì food intake and ‚Üë energy expenditure (reduced metabolic efficiency).
- Obese individuals paradoxically have high leptin levels due to high body fat content, but leptin it is unknown why these high Leptin levels do not lead to reduced weight gain/increased weight loss.

### Leptin Resistance

- Leptin crosses BBB via short form leptin receptors (saturable mechanism).
- CSF leptin levels are low in obese patients relative to their high plasma levels, indicating that not all of the Leptin in the blood is able to cross the BBB to enter the CSF (due to the saturable transport mechanism)
- This means that if Leptin is administered centrally, past the BBB, it can produce some weight loss
- A decreased response to Leptin has also ben seen in the Hypothalamus by obese Px (Alongside Hypothalamic Insulin Resistance)
- Dietary fat and fructose do not ‚Üë Insulin and hence, leptin secretion, which may explain why diets high in these components are associated with obesity as they do not stimulate leptin secretion and hence, satiety

---

# Leptin and Weight Regain

- Whilst weight loss is relatively easy to achieve, it is difficult to maintain weight loss/lowered weight, with many Px often putting the weight back on afterwards.
- However, whilst weight loss causes significantly decreased Leptin Levels, Weight regain does not lead to an increase in Leptin Levels back to normal amounts, with Leptin Levels decreasing despite Weight Regain
- As weight loss occurs, Insulin Levels drop (as Insulin Sensitivity increases) but following Weight regain, Insulin levels increased above to that which was seen before, indicating reduced Insulin Sensitivity following Weight Regain

![Screenshot 2022-01-22 at 16.38.07.png](%5B015%5D%20Endocrine%20Aspects%20of%20Obesity%205ad650d875854e18ad215ac69a98b28f/Screenshot_2022-01-22_at_16.38.07.png)

---

# Other Effects of Leptin

- Leptin is known to have a role in immunity and development of immune system.
- Normal immune function is suppressed during nutritional deprivation, but this can be reversed by administration of leptin.
- Leptin is also a chemoattractant.
- High levels secreted by adipocytes in obesity may be responsible for infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue.
- Leptin also has an effect on reproductive system.

---

# Adiponectin

- Found in high levels in plasma of healthy individuals.
- Adiponectin is an adipokine secreted by mature adipocytes.
- Plasma levels of adiponectin are ‚Üì significantly in obese patients.
- Expression of adiponectin depends on ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùëÖùõæ, but expression is inhibited by TNF-ùõº and is lower in large adipocytes
- This means that as an individual gains weight, there is Adipocyte Hypertrophy, causing reduced Adiponectin Secretion.
- ‚Üì adiponectin levels are associated with hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance and risk of T2DM.
- There are several gene polymorphisms that have been associated with metabolic syndrome and T2DM.
- Adiponectin levels can be ‚Üë by weight loss, exercise and synthetic ligands to ùëÉùëÉùê¥ùëÖùõæ, such as thiazolidinediones.
- ‚Üë adiponectin levels ‚Üë insulin sensitivity.
- Skeletal muscle has AdipoR1, which is stimulated by adiponectin to ‚Üë glucose uptake and ‚Üë ùõΩ-oxidation of FA, which ‚Üë insulin sensitivity by reducing FA Stores within Adipocytes.
- Liver has AdipoR2, which is stimulated by adiponectin and improves insulin sensitivity to ‚Üì gluconeogenesis and plasma glucose.
- Adiponectin is also anti-inflammatory as it inhibits TNF-ùõº secretion by monocytes and macrophages to prevent chronic inflammation.
- High adiponectin is also associated with ‚Üì risk of CVD.

---

# Inflammation in Obesity

- Obesity is associated with mild, chronic inflammation.
- This may be due to hypoxia in hypertrophying adipose tissue where blood supply is not sufficient to maintain growth or high levels of FFA stimulating Toll-like receptors.
- In obesity, many inflammatory markers are at higher levels in plasma including CRP, IL-6 and serum amyloid A (SAA).
- Adipose tissue produces and excretes IL-6, IL-8, IL-1ùõΩ, TNF-ùõº and chemokines.
- These stimulate inflammatory responses that recruit immune cells, stimulate immune cell maturation and determine which developmental pathway immune cells follow.
- These proteins also inhibit preadipocyte maturation to prevent Adipocyte Hyperplasia, leading to increase Adipocyte Hypertrophy, causing increased release of Inflammatory Markers in a Positive Feedback loop
- Severity of chronic inflammation correlates well with size of
visceral adipocytes
- Therefore, obesity leads to recruitment of Tc and Inflammatory M1 Macrophages, leading to Macrophage Necrosis, leading to Increased Macrophage Recruitment in a positive feedback cycle

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 18.45.20.png](%5B015%5D%20Endocrine%20Aspects%20of%20Obesity%205ad650d875854e18ad215ac69a98b28f/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_18.45.20.png)

---

# Anti and Proinflammatory Proteins

### Anti-Inflammatory Proteins

- E.g. IL-10 and adiponectin.
- Both are produced less as obesity ‚Üë.
- Adiponectin inhibits activation of macrophages, and stimulates them to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines
such as IL-10.

### Pro-Inflammatory Proteins

- E.g. Leptin, IL-6, angiotensin, TNF-ùõº.
- All ‚Üë in plasma in obese individuals.
- 1/3 of circulating IL-6 is produced by adipose tissues.
- Levels predict onset of T2DM.
- Also inhibits adiponectin expression.
- IL-6 causes liver to make inflammatory proteins (e.g. CRP).
- Some aspects of inflammation are dependent on RAAS, which is overactive in adipose tissue of obese.

---

# Macrophage Infiltration

- Macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue ‚Üë in obesity.
- Macrophages are typically clustered around individual adipocytes, forming crown like structures (CLS).
- These CLS are always found around dead adipocytes, that appear to have undergone necrosis (inflammatory) rather than apoptosis (non-inflammatory).
- Adipocyte Necrosis was ‚Üë with size of adipocyte, even in lean individuals, or mice models of adipocyte hypertrophy without obesity.
- Infiltrating macrophages may then secrete large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines.
- Macrophage Infiltration has been shown to occur before hyperinsulinemia

---

# Insulin Resistance

- Insulin resistance occurs when there is an inadequate response to normal insulin levels and more insulin needs to be secreted to maintain normoglycaemia.
- In long-term, this leads to pancreatic ùõΩ cell failure and T2DM.
- Insulin resistance can result from down-regulation of receptor, or of proteins downstream in signalling pathway.
- Insulin resistance may also be due to inflammatory signalling pathways, interacting with (inhibiting) components of insulin signalling pathway (E.g IRS-1), for example, by serine phosphorylation of IRS.
- Leptin is pro-inflammatory improves insulin sensitivity via AMPK, but not in obese Px where leptin resistance is seen.

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 18.47.43.png](%5B015%5D%20Endocrine%20Aspects%20of%20Obesity%205ad650d875854e18ad215ac69a98b28f/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_18.47.43.png)

- Among obese, insulin resistance is also correlated with lipid deposition in skeletal muscle and liver as it impaired Glucose Uptake and Lipogenesis within Adipocytes (Ectopic Lipid Deposition).
- Ectopic lipid deposition is attributed to an inability of subcutaneous adipocytes to handle load of fat storage, so TAG
storage spills over into visceral adipose tissue, skeletal muscle and liver.
- Ectopic deposition of lipids may lead to an ‚Üë in other compounds, such as ceramide that alter signalling pathways.
- Substances that inhibit adipogenesis (e.g. TNFùõº, angiotensin) are implicated in this process
- Substances that ‚Üë adipogenesis (TZSs and adiponectin) can ‚Üë insulin sensitivity without necessarily causing weight loss.

---

# Adiponectin and Insulin Resistance

- Plasma adiponectin levels ‚Üì as obesity progresses and are associated with insulin resistance and progression to T2DM.
- Adiponectin activates AMPK which favours fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle via AdipoR1. This ‚Üì ectopic lipid storage in muscle, and ‚Üë its sensitivity to insulin.
- Adiponectin ‚Üì expression of PEPCK and G6Pase in liver, ‚Üì hyperglycaemia.
- Adiponectin is anti-inflammatory and opposes activity and expression of TNF-ùõº.
- Other anti-inflammatory drugs may be able to ‚Üì insulin-resistance (e.g. aspirin)

---

# Hypertension

- High blood pressure: an important risk factor for CVD closely correlated with ‚Üë BMI even more closely with measures of
abdominal adiposity/central obesity.
- Weight loss ‚Üì hypertension.
- Endothelial cells lining blood vessels can produce:
1. Vasodilators: e.g. NO, prostacyclin.
2. Vasoconstrictors: e.g. ROS, endothelin-1, RAS components.
- Proliferation of SMCs can ‚Üë arterial stiffness, which increases blood pressure.
- Perivascular AT adipokine secretion is altered by obesity and may contribute to hypertension.

---

# Hypertension, Leptin and Inflammation

### Hypertension and Leptin

- Leptin stimulates SNS (‚Üë energy expenditure), ‚Üë blood pressure, even if a Px has Leptin Resistance
- Leptin induces secretion of endothelin-1 in ECs and expression of its receptor in SMCs to produce vasoconstriction.
- Promotes SMC proliferation, stiffening arteries.
- Stimulates production of pro inflammatory cytokines

### Hypertension and Inflammation

- Inflammatory cytokines are also involved in hypertension.
- Effects observed include:
1. ‚Üì in NO production by endothelial cells, reducing vasodilation.
2. ‚Üë in ROS, which further depletes NO and increases vasoconstriction.
3. Stimulation of angiotensinogen production by a wide variety of cells.
4. Induction of endothelin-1 expression by ECs and SMCs to increase vasoconstriction.
5. Enhancement of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation to stiffen arteries and increase BP.

---

# Hypertension and the RAAS

- Angiotensinogen -ùëüùëíùëõùëñùëõ‚Üí angiotensin I ‚ÄîACE‚Üí angiotensin II ‚Üí receptor.
- Adipose tissues expresses most of components of RAS system, classically involved in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance.
- Angiotensin I: mature adipocytes produce more angiotensinogen.
- More is produced in obesity, notably by
visceral adipocytes and in response to glucocorticoids.
- ‚Üë secretion results in an ‚Üë in local and systemic concentrations of angiotensinogen, which may contribute to hypertension.
- Adipose tissue also responds to angiotensin II (‚Üì hyperplasia, ‚Üì sensitivity to insulin, ‚Üë inflammation).

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 18.52.23.png](%5B015%5D%20Endocrine%20Aspects%20of%20Obesity%205ad650d875854e18ad215ac69a98b28f/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_18.52.23.png)

---

# Adiponectin, Hypertension and CVD

- Low adiponectin levels correlate with high blood pressure.
- Endothelial cells express AdipoR1 and 2, promoting their health.
- Adiponectin ‚Üë EC NO production (as AMPK activates eNOS).
- NO also ‚Üì SMC proliferation and ‚Üì oxidative stress via ROS.
- Adiponectin inhibits TNF-ùõº signalling, so expression of adhesion molecules on ECs ‚Üì. It also inhibits foam cell formation.
- Oxidised LDL inhibits eNOS activity, but adiponectin suppresses this inhibition.

---

# Obesity and Cancer

- Obesity is linked with ‚Üë risk of some types of cancer and its severity:
1. More aggressive tumours.
2. ‚Üë number of metastases.
3. ‚Üë chemotherapy resistance.
4. ‚Üë rate of recurrence.
5. ‚Üë mortality.
- Exercise during and after cancer treatment can significantly improve survival, potentially via the effects of Exercise on Adipokine secretion
- Plasma levels of adipokines do not always show an association with cancer risk because their signalling mechanism may be paracrine, so local [ ] may be more significant than systemic [ ] (i.e. tumours have locally ‚Üë levels of adipokine, produced by surrounding adipose tissue).

---

# Adipokines and Cancer

- Plasma leptin and cancer risk is inconclusive.
- Locally ‚Üë leptin levels have been reported to increase cancer risk, likely via paracrine signalling.
- Plasma adiponectin levels are consistently lower in cancer patients and hypoadiponectinaemia is a marker for an aggressive phenotype.
- Inflammation has also been linked to cancer risk and tumour phenotype, promoting aggression, survival and metastasis.
- Adipose tissue also produces growth factors that stimulate angiogenesis, development of blood vessels that supply tumour (neovascularisation).

---

# Cancer, Cell Growth and Angiogenesis

### Cancer and Cell Growth

- Leptin can act as a mitogen on many cell types, and an inhibitor of apoptosis.
- Tumours are often found to express leptin receptor, and has been linked to poor prognosis due to increased proliferation of tumour cells via Leptin Signalling.
- Pro-inflammatory cytokines enhance leptin production by preadipocytes.
- Adiponectin suppresses proliferation, causes arrest of cell growth and favours apoptosis.

### Angiogenesis and Cancer

- Leptin is a promotor of angiogenesis: plays an important role in wound healing, where it is released by subcutaneous fat.
- VEGF is produced by macrophages that infiltrate chronically inflamed adipose tissue. It acts synergistically with leptin to promote angiogenesis in tumours.
- Hepatocyte growth factor is an adipokine that also has angiogenic properties in tumours.
- TNF-ùõº can be angiogenic at low levels, while IL-6 ‚Üë expression of VEGF.
- Leptin is a chemoattractant for monocytes and macrophages, and ‚Üë their production of TNF-ùõº and IL-6 to increase VEGF Expression and Angiogenesis, establishing a positive feedback cycle.
- Adiponectin is anti-angiogenic.
- Neovascularisation occurs early in tumour development.
- Blood vessels formed are abnormal, hyper-permeable to small molecules, plasma fluid and proteins as they are rapidly formed.
- Such vessels are easier for metastatic tumour cells to invade (due to their hyperpermeability) and thereby enter circulation.
- These tumour cells may then reach distant sites and potentially form new tumours (metastasis).

---

# Metastasis

- Metastatic progression is a major cause of mortality in cancer.
- Adipocytes can produce compounds that increase the likelihood of Metastasis via an unknown mechanism
- This could be due to the fact that Invasive cancer cells may express chemokine receptors, so inflamed adipose tissue produces chemokines (e.g. CCL2, leptin), aiding tumour cell survival in new locations.
- HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) is produced in adipose tissue, and elevated in plasma in obesity.
- This disrupts adherens junctions, promoting cell dispersal to further allow for Metastasis.

---

# Summary

- Adipocytes are excellent as a storage site for TAG, but have an endocrine role that allows them to alter whole body metabolism in obesity.
- Secretory profile of adipocytes is altered by nutritional state, location of depot, size of cell and interaction with other signalling molecules.
- In obesity, a response of hypertrophy seems to stimulate secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and favours insulin resistance.
- Alteration in adipokine secretion during obesity may be responsible for many problems associated with obesity, in
particular, development of metabolic syndrome.
