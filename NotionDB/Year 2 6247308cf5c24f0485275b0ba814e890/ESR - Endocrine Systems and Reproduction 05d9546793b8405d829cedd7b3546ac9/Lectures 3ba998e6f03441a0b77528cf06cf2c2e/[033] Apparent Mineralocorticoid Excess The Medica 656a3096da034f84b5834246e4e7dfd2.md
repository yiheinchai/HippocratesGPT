# Dilemma of Mineralocorticoid Receptor

- MR has no inherent specificity for mineralocorticoids.
- MR has a higher affinity for Cortisol than the GR.
- [Cortisol] > 100-1000 x [aldosterone].
1. Cortisol = nmol/L.
2. Aldosterone = pmol/L
- Therefore, the issue lies where Aldosterone potentially cannot stimulate MR as excess Cortisol saturates the MRs and prevents Aldosterone from doing so in Non-Mineralocorticoid Selective Tissues
- Aldosterone and Cortisol have a very similar structure but Aldosterone has a CHO on C18 whereas Cortisol has a -OH on C17 which allows the MR to bind both ligands

- To allow the Mineralocorticoid Selective Tissues to be responsive to Aldosterone instead of Cortisol, 11ùõΩ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 is expressed in these tissues, which converts cortisol (Affinity - MR > GR) to 11 dehydrocortisol (cortisone) via Oxidation
- 11ùõΩ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 can also oxidise other Glucocorticoids like Corticosterone
- 11ùõΩ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1  catalyses the reduction of Corticosterone to Cortisol
- This reduces MR stimulation by Cortisol and allows the tissue to become Aldosterone Selective as Cortisone has a much greater affinity for GR than MR and hence, is less likely to stimulate the MR, allowing Aldosterone to bind to and stimulate the MR.
- Especially active in kidney (collecting
ducts), colon, salivary glands and placenta (aldosterone selective tissues).

# Why Might 11ùú∑HSD Type 2 Fail?

- In Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess, 11ùú∑HSD Type 2 is not functional/present and as a result, Aldosterone Selective Tissues are unable to convert Cortisol to Cortisone
- This means that MR become saturated with Cortisol, leading to overstimulation of MRs, with Aldosterone unable to bind to the MR (Tissue loses Aldosterone Selectivity)
- Mutations in the gene:
1. Coding sequence (loss of function).
2. Regulatory region (‚Üì expression ‚Üí Usually a Milder Phenotype).
- Enzyme inhibition e.g. glycyrrhetinic acid (active component of liquorice).
- Known mutations in 11ùõΩHSD are recessive. Believed it may have
given our ancestors ability to conserve Na‚Å∫.
- This is significant because:
1. Defective genes need to be homozygous to generate phenotype ‚Üí AME usually confined to consanguineous parentage.
2. But heterozygotes (Notably in Px from South Asia) might have ‚Üë ability to conserve Na‚Å∫ (Similar to that seen in Mild Phenotype of AME) under conditions of Na‚Å∫ deprivation giving a selective advantage which may have led to conserved mutations which are passed to offspring.

# Inhibition of 111ùú∑HSD Type 2

- Endogenous mammalian compounds:
1. Bile pigments (e.g. deoxycholate).
2. Sterols (e.g. cholesterol, lanosterol).
3. Steroids (e.g. progesterone).
- Iatrogenic:
1. Carbenoxolone (ester of glycyrrhetinic acid).
2. Furosemide
- Other:
1. Glycyrrhetinic acid (e.g. liquorice, herbal remedies).

# If 11ùú∑HSD is Fully Active,
Why Might Cortisol Gain
Inappropriate Access To MR?

- High [Cortisol] (e.g. Cushing‚Äôs disease, glucocorticoid resistance), which exceeds capacity of 11ùú∑HSD Type 2
- This means that some excess Cortisol remains unmetabolised and hence, can stimulate the MR to produce AME

---

# Classical Sx of AME ‚Üí Similar to those of Primary Hyperaldosteronism/Conn‚Äôs Syndrome

- Anti-natriuresis (Hypernatraemia due to increased ENaC Insertion following MR activation)
- ‚Üë fluid resorption (due to ADH Release due to Hypernatraemia).
- Hypervolemic hypertension.
- Kaliuresis leading to hypokalaemia.
- Muscle weakness (including cardiac), fatigue.

# DDx of Low-Renin Hypertension

- Low Renin, High Aldosterone and Hypokalaemia ‚Üí Primary Hyperaldosteronism/Conn‚Äôs Disease
- Low Renin, Normal Aldosteronism and Hypokalaemia ‚Üí Essential Hypertension
- Many Px with Rx-Resistant Hypertension often have underlying Endocrine Causes
- Low Renin, Low-Normal Aldosteronism, Normal GFR, Hyperkalaemia and Hypernatraemia ‚Üí Gordon‚Äôs Syndrome (Type of Pseudohypoaldosteronism)
- Low Renin, Low Aldosterone and Low/Normal K‚Å∫ ‚Üí Liddle‚Äôs Syndrome (Mutation to one of the 3 subunits of ENaC, causing Overexpression), CAH, Glucocorticoid Resistance
- 95% of cases of CAH is caused by 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency, 4% from 11ùú∑ Hydroxylase Mutation and Very Low Percentage due to 17Œ±-Hydroxylase (No Adrenal Corticosteroid Production and Adrenal Androgens), AME, Licorice/Grapefruit Juice Ingestion, Ectopic ACTH or DOC Producing Tumours and High Salt Diets

# Placental 11ùú∑HSD-2

- It has a protective role in foetus, where it converts maternal cortisol into cortisone.
- ‚Üë stress and cortisol lead to damage/impaired growth in foetus because excess cortisol exceeds capacity of enzyme, meaning not all the cortisol can be metabolised.

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 11.41.10.png](%5B033%5D%20Apparent%20Mineralocorticoid%20Excess%20The%20Medica%20656a3096da034f84b5834246e4e7dfd2/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_11.41.10.png)

### Consequences of Failure of Placental 11ùú∑HSD-2

- ‚Üë passage of cortisol to foetus.
- Stimulates premature differentiation of foetal tissues (need cortisol at term).
- Prevents further growth of tissues.
- Culminates in IUGR (Interuterine Growth Retardation).
- Barker hypothesis: ‚Üë risk of CVD, Obesity, Hypertension etc. if a baby is born small for Gestational Age.

# 11ùú∑-HSD in Liver, Lung, Fat, Gonads, Brain and Pituitary is Mostly Type 1 and ‚Üì Corticoids

- To prevent systemic activity of Cortisol but ensure it is delivered in sufficient quantities to tissues, it is inactivated by 11ùú∑HSD-2 and transports in the Circulation as Cortisone, bound to Transcortin and Albumin, where it can be reactivated at specific target tissues by 11ùõΩHSD type 1 to allow Glucocorticoids to produce effects at MR and GR.
- Overexpression of 11ùú∑HSD-1, especially in fat, can lead to symptoms similar to metabolic syndrome (Obesity, CVD etc.) and apparent glucocorticoid excess.

# 17ùõΩHSD Can Modulate Steroid Potency

- Weak Sex hormones like Androstenedione (Androgen) and Oestrone (Oestrogen) can be converted into Testosterone and Oestradiol respectively (Strong Sex Hormones) via the Oxidation of a C17 Ketone to C17 OH catalysed by 17ùú∑HSD
- DHEA synthesised by the Adrenal Cortex can be converted into Androstenedione outside of the Adrenal and hence, converted into Testosterone
- These enzymes often have a Type 1 and Type 2 Isoform that catalyse opposite reactions in order to tightly regulate Steroid Potency

# Importance of Steroid Sulphtransferases and Sulphatases

- DHEA and estrone are sulphated by sulphotransferases to sulphate esters when synthesised which inactivates them to prevent systemic Sex Steroid Activity
- Sulphate Ester Sex Steroids are then desulphated by sulphatases in the target tissues into active forms.

# Alternative Fates of Testosterone

- 5ùõº reductase generates 5ùõº-dihydrotestosterone which is most
potent androgen (it increases Testosterone‚Äôs potency and hence, Testosterone activity).
- This Induces male periphery/determine the male phenotype/masculinisation.
- Mutations to 5ùõº reductase are commonly seen in Cosanginuous Families in Polynesia, Egypt and Turkey which causes Reduced Masculinisation at Birth (Babies appear like Girls in Absolute Deficiency) and at Puberty, Synthesis of Gonadal Steroids leads to Masculinisation to make babies acquire the Male Phenotype
- Testosterone enters brain and is converted by aromatase to oestradiol, which masculises male brain.
- Therefore, mutations of Aromatase can prevent conversion of Testosterone to Oestradiol within the Brain can prevent masculinisation of the male brain during development
- In Men, Testosterone can compensate for this lack of Oestrogen to allow for Delayed Masculinisation of the Male Brain whilst Secondary Sexual Characteristics are developed
- In Girls, Testosterone is not metabolised by Aromatase accumulates and is redirected into 5ùõº-DHT Synthesis, causing increased Masculinisation in the Young, causing Ambiguous/Masculinised Female Genitalia
