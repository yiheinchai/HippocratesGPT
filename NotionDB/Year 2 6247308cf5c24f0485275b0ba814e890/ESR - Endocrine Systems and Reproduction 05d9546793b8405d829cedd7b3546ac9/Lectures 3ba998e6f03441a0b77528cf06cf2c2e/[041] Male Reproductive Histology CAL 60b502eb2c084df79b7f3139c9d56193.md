### Seminiferous Epithelium

- Germinal epithelium containing several types of cell:
1. Spermatogonia
2. Spermatocytes
3. Spermatids
4. Spermatozoa
5. Sertoli cells
- Spermatogonia. Found in the basal layers resting on the basement membrane, they divide mitotically
to give rise to further stem cells called Type A spermatogonia, and Type B spermatogonia.
- Type A spermatogonia (SA) have large dark nuclei (condensed chromatin) with peripheral nucleoli (if visible).
- Type B spermatogonia (SB) have large pale nuclei (dispersed chromatin) with central nucleoli;
- Primary spermatocytes (S1) are the largest cells here, with distinctive nuclei in which the chromatin is in clumps or threads
- Spermatids mature during spermiogenesis and become spermatozoa (SZ), changing their
appearance from small round cells to smaller pointed cells.
- Sertoli cells (SC) support the spermatogenic cells. THIS
- They rest on the basement membrane and extend to the lumen, their nuclei are usually oval or triangular, pale with a prominent nucleolus above the basal level.
- Their cytoplasm surrounds the spermatogenic cells and Sertoli cells make tight junctions with each other, thus providing a cellular barrier between the circulation and the spermatogenic cell, the so-called blood testis barrier.
- Difficult to differentiate between Type B Spermatocytes and Sertoli Cells
- The germinal epithelium with its basal lamina sits on a thin layer of fibromuscular connective tissue, with fibromyocytes (myoid cells, myoepithelial cells) dispersed amongst collagen and elastin fibres that they have laid down.
- Frequent Contractions of the Fibromuscular Capsule aids to move the differentiating cells superficially towards the Tubular Lumen

- Tubules with irregular epithelium are efferent ducts.
- At the edge is a portion of the thick testicular capsule, the tunica albuginea
- The Ductus Epididymis has regular tall columnar epithelium with apical microvilli
- Tubules surrounded by circular/spiral smooth muscle fibres merging into the connective tissue capsule/stroma with coarse collagen bundles which surrounds each of the tubules.
- Characteristically, the ductus epididymis contains sperm within the lumen.

![Epi9003.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Epi9003.jpg)

### Medium Power

- Interstitial cells, or Leydig cells (IC), are endocrine cells that are found dispersed in the loose connective tissue between seminiferous tubules, in irregular clumps of variable size.
- These cells have large cytoplasm, round pale nucleus and prominent nucleolus.
- Due to their role in the production of large volumes of Gonadal Androgens, they are surrounded by Loose CT that is highly vascularised with Capillaries
- Not all of the Synthesised Testosterone enters these capillaries and remains in the Spaces between the Tubules, causing Local [Testosterone] to be high to drive Spermatogenesis and Spermiogenesis

![Tes8901.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Tes8901.jpg)

- The human testes are highly vascular and contains lymphatic vessels

![Tes8905.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Tes8905.jpg)

- The wall of the tubules of the Ductus Epididymis consists of:
1. An external adventitia of connective tissue that merges with the connective tissue between the tubules
2. An outer layer of smooth muscle, oriented predominantly circularly or obliquely (spirally)
3. Subepithelial connective tissue (a thin layer)
4. An inner lining of simple columnar epithelium

![Epi9003.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Epi9003%201.jpg)

### High Power

![Tes8906.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Tes8906.jpg)

- During spermiogenesis the cytoplasm of the spermatid is reduced and phagocytosed by the Sertoli cells as the nucleus condenses and the acrosome forms.
- Synchronous development of Spermatids is enabled by hundreds of spermatids being connected to one
another by very fine cytoplasmic processes that persist as the spermatozoa form and which
break only when the spermatozoa are released into the lumen
- Spermatozoa stain pink and are extremely thin with their tails extending into the Tubular Lumen and their heads (containing their nuclei) found embedded in the Luminal Wall

# Seminal Vesicles

### Low Power

- It has highly folded, irregular mucosa/columnar epithelium projecting into the lumen forming numerous intricate cavities

![Sem9105.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Sem9105.jpg)

- It also has a thick fibromuscular wall that runs underneath the folded epithelium which is surrounded by Connective Tissue/Adventitia
- The muscle here is organised as an inner circular and outer longitudinal layer
- In the Adventitia, there are many large blood vessels and nerves found

![Sem9101.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Sem9101.jpg)

- The walls of the Seminal Vesicle are Adventitia → Muscularis → Submucosa and Mucosa

![Sem9104.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Sem9104.jpg)

# Vas Deferens

- This is a muscular tube, containing 3 layers of SM (Inner and Outer Longitudinal with a much thicker Middle Circular Layer)
- It has low columnar Epithelium and a central irregularly folded lumen which can smooth out/expand during Ejaculation
- The distal end of the Epididymis is continuous with the Proximal end of the Vas Deferens
- In the Adventitia of the Vas Deferens, large blood vessels can be seen, alongside nerves which supply the Vas Deferens

![Vas9001.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Vas9001.jpg)

# Prostate Gland

### Very Low Power

- The prostate gland surrounds the urethra between the base of the urinary bladder and the base of the penis.
- This specimen is not normal; there is evidence of previous infection, with epithelial changes in the secretory alveoli and cyst formation.
- It contains compound exocrine, alveolar secretory units, cystic areas of glandular tissue can be seen and are patchily distributed.
- In this region, the urethra running through the Prostate is called the prostatic urethra and it has a crescentic lumen.
- Its epithelium is transitional (continuous with that of the bladder) and it becomes simple or pseudostratified columnar as it leaves the prostate gland to become the membranous urethra.
- In the penis the spongy urethra has a simple or pseudostratified columnar epithelium, except at its exit at the end of the penis where it is stratified squamous.
- Connective tissue septa from the capsule divide the gland into poorly defined lobules.
- The connective tissue also contains irregular bundles of smooth muscle cells (which contract under sympathetic control).
- The prostatic glands drain into ducts which coalesce and eventually drain into the urethra on each side of the urethral crest.
- Prostatic Glands are visualised as small circular regions with clear-staining lumens that are tightly bound together into Lobules, surrounded by muscular tissue
- In this image, large prostatic ducts are found surrounding the Urethra and may be seen converging on the urethra.

- The prostate gland is encapsulated.
- The capsule is fairly thick contains fibroelastic connective tissue with smooth muscle cells.

![Pro9207-1.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Pro9207-1.jpg)

### Medium Power

- Highly vascularised and thick fibromuscular connective tissue separates the small glandular elements.
- The glandular tissue is highly folded and irregular (low-columnar or Cuboidal)
- It can be difficult to differentiate the smooth muscle cells from the fibrous connective tissue.

![Pro9211.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Pro9211.jpg)

- Sometimes, circular masses, comprised of successive regular Glycoprotein layers appear called Corpus Amylaceus, found within Prostatic Glands and causing them to become distended
- With age, these calcify to form True Prostatic concretions

![Pro9208.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Pro9208.jpg)

- PSNS Ganglia can also be found lying against the prostatic capsule/adventitia alongside numerous blood vessels

![Pro9209.jpg](%5B041%5D%20Male%20Reproductive%20Histology%20CAL%2060b502eb2c084df79b7f3139c9d56193/Pro9209.jpg)

### High Power

- The glandular epithelium (E) is pseudostratified cuboidal or columnar, and is highly branched or folded
- The lamina propria (LP) contains a core of connective tissue and carries the services.
