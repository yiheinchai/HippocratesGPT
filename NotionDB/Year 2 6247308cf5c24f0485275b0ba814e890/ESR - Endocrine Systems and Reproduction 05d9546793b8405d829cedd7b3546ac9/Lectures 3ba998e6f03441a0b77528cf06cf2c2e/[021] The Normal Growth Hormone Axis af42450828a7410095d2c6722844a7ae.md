# [021] The Normal Growth Hormone Axis

Progress: Anki In Progress

# Hormonal Interactions

- GH is produced by Somatotrophs in the Anterior Pituitary Gland
- Hypothalamic inhibitory factor of GH secretion: somatostatin (SRIF).
- Hypothalamic stimulatory factor of GH secretion: GH releasing hormone (GHRH).
- Both SRIF and GHRH act through engagement with specific cell-surface receptor on somatotrophs or GH producing cells in anterior pituitary.
- GH is released in an episodic manner/pulsatile manner (Cycles of Large Peaks which drop to low [ ])  throughout the day but predominantly at night when asleep
- GH regulates its own secretion by inhibiting GHRH synthesis (and release) and stimulates SRIF synthesis (and release).
- GH also stimulates the release of insulin-like growth factor from the Liver predominantly (IGF-1, in turn with GH, stimulates tissue proliferation).
- GH also stimulates IGF-1 release from Muscle, Bone and Adipocytes
- IGF-1 inhibits GH secretion either directly (by inhibiting somatotrophs) or indirectly (by stimulating SRIF release).
- Ghrelin is secreted from stomach and stimulates GH release from somatotrophs to protect against starvation.

# Growth Hormone

- When given clinically, it has to be taken IV or intramuscular (usually) as it is a peptide hormone.
- GH is Secreted from somatotroph cells in anterior pituitary.
- GH is Stored and released from preformed granules. Most released during sleep.
- 10% of pituitary dry weight.
- 10 mg/pituitary.

---

# Chemistry

- Single chain protein.
- 2 internal disulphide bonds.
- 2 forms which both stimulate GHR:
1. 22kD (major)
2. 20kD (minor)
- t1/2: 15 minutes (as it is a peptide and hence, rapidly degraded)
- Similar in structure to prolactin.

---

# Regulation of Secretion

- Both GHRH (10aa) and somatostatin (14aa) are small hypothalamic peptides.
- Both act on G-protein coupled receptors on somatotrophs
- GHRH activates adenylyl cyclase Via Gs.
- Somatostatin acts via Gi to inhibit AC.
- cAMP activates PKA which phosphorylates CREB which upregulates PIT1.
- PIT1 transcription factor which turns on Transcription of GH: without this, no GH production

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 00.09.30.png](%5B021%5D%20The%20Normal%20Growth%20Hormone%20Axis%20af42450828a7410095d2c6722844a7ae/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_00.09.30.png)

- Androgens and oestrogens sensitise somatotrophs to GHRH.
- This accounts for pubertal rise in GH secretion and hence, growth spurt due to increased Androgen and Oestrogen production from Gonads at this time.
- Metabolic products influence GH release: used for clinical tests to test the ability of the Anterior Pituitary to produce Growth Hormone.
- Arginine, Thyroid Hormones and Gonadal Hormones ↑ GH release.
- During starvation, proteins are broken down to form arginine which then stimulates GH release.
- GH is counter regulatory and antagonist in function to insulin and inhibits it to minimise Insulin Dependent Glucose Disposal and maximise glucose supply to the Brain and RBCs that can only produce ATP via Glycolysis.
- Glucose, Cortisol and FFA ↓ GH release.
- This ensures that there is reduced antagonism of Insulin by GH to maximise Glucose Storage within Liver, Muscle and Adipose Tissue

# GHR Actions

- GH is widely used to promote growth and anabolism via GHR, both directly by tyrosine kinase activation and indirectly via IGF-1.
- 2 binding sites on each molecules of GH.
- When site 1 binds, causes a twist in other receptor, bringing the 2 signalling
molecules together at transmembrane area.
- 2 GHRs homodimerise once GH binds, secondary signalling mechanisms activated.
- GHR is a member of cytokine receptor superfamily with a Single Transmembrane domain.
- Binding of hormone realigns subunits by rotation and closer apposition, resulting in the 2 catalytic domains of associated tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2 overlapping below cell membrane in the cytosol.

---

# GHR Signalling

- Activated JAK2 phosphorylates GHR on tyrosine residues, which in turn recruit members of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT).
- 2 STAT molecules dimerise and translocate to nucleus to modulate target gene transcription such as IGF-1 and SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signalling).
- SOCS terminate GH signal cascade by desensitising GHR to GH.
- This means that strong activation of GHR eventually desensitises the receptor for a period of time, during which it cannot be activated until it becomes resensitised (producing the Pulsatile Like Pattern of GH activity)
- Insensitivity to GH (Laron syndrome) can result from mutations in GHR, whereas excessive activation of GHR results in gigantism and acromegaly.

---

# GHR Induced Insulin Resistance

- GH-mediated induction of insulin resistance is well documented, responsible for GH antagonism of Insulin, but mechanism by which GH mediates this effect is not completely understood.
- GH-induced ↑ in FFA flux from adipose tissue has been associated with impaired insulin action at target tissues.
- FFA Influx activates Signalling Cascades that leads with expression of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3, which have been associated with insulin resistance and down-regulation of insulin signalling.

# Human GH Gene Family

- Human GH/chorionic somatomammotropin (CS) (produced in placenta) locus is located on chromosome 17 and contains multiple different GH Genes, expressed in different tissues.
- GH-N (Normal GH) is expressed preferentially in somatotropes of anterior pituitary, while GH-V and CS genes are expressed in syncytiotrophoblasts of placenta.
- Hypersensitivity sites (HS) are where gene transcription starts from (Promoter Regions).
- These have been identified by activating genes and identifying areas that become more susceptible to enzymatic digestion due to their presence within the Transcription Bubble (Region of DNA that is unwound to allow RNA Polymerase to access and transcribe the Gene)
- HS I and II are pituitary specific, found just upstream to GH-N.
- HS IV is placenta specific, and HS III and V are found in both pituitary and placenta but nowhere else.

# Clinical Consequences of Species Specificity of Growth Hormone

- In humans there are 2 groups of receptors that respond to GH:
1. Lactogenic receptors: both GH + PRL (prolactin) activate.
2. Somatogenic receptors: only human GH activates.
- Most animals can use a variety of different GH Isoforms from different species whereas the Specificity of Human GHRs means that only Human GH can be used in Humans
- Must treat GH deficient children with human GH.
- Pre-1985, hGH was extracted from human pituitaries which carried significant disease risks such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease.
- Human GH is now manufactured by recombinant technology to prevent transmission of infections from Cadavers to Px.

# Physiological Actions of GH

**Metabolic**

- ↓ glucose metabolism (opposing insulin).
- ↑ lipolysis → Shifts Metabolism from Carbohydrate focused to other metabolic fuels
- ↑ protein synthesis (anabolic).
- ↑ milk yield in cows.

**Also:**

- ↑ IGF production from liver.
- ↑ chondrocyte and cartilage formation.

**Indirect Actions via IGF-1**

- Growth promotion through clonal expansion/hyperplasia of chondrocytes and growth of bones, soft tissues, viscera.
- These are more likely to be Paracrine Actions of GH within an individual tissue to cause Hypertrophy, Hyperplasia and Differentiation

---

# Structure of IGF-1

- Very similar in structure to Insulin, containing 2 Internal Disulphide Bonds (Resembles proinsulin + tail).
- Unlike Insulin, it has a linking chain between the 2 chains that is still found within the Active Molecule (Unlike C-Peptide)
- IGF-1, but not IGF-2 (Important in growth and development In Utero), acts via insulin-like receptors to stimulate post-natal growth .
- IGF-1 also known as somatomedin C

# Role of GH in Transforming Fibroblasts

- In Connective Tissue, GH causes Fibroblast proliferation
- It also causes fibroblasts to differentiate into:
1. Chondrocytes. It also stimulates IGF-1 release here to cause clonal expansion via paracrine signalling.
2. Fibroblasts into osteoblasts.
3. Fibroblasts into fat cells (notably within Marrow to maintain Nutrition to Osteocytes growing bone, stimulated by differentiation into OB)
- It also stimulates IGF-1 release here to cause clonal expansion via paracrine signalling.

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 00.21.07.png](%5B021%5D%20The%20Normal%20Growth%20Hormone%20Axis%20af42450828a7410095d2c6722844a7ae/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_00.21.07.png)

---

# Growth Plate

- Cell differentiation takes place in growth  plate due to GH Signalling.
- GH and IGF-1 cause cells to multiply and differentiate.
- Here, GH stimulates Fibroblasts to differentiate into Chondrocytes
- IGF-1 then is involved in Maturation and Proliferation of Chondrocytes to form Chondroblasts that secrete Cartilage which becomes calcified
- GH stimulates Fibroblasts to differentiate into Osteoblasts
- IGF-1 then is involved in Maturation and Proliferation of Osteoblasts to allow them to secrete Osteoid

# Growth of Long Bones

- ↑ in growth plate thickness is response to GH used for classical in vivo bioassay to determine the degree of GH Signalling as GH causes Growth Plate to widen:
1. Remove pituitary from pre-pubertal rat that is still growing.
2. Inject GH
3. Remove tibia/cut bone sections.
4. Measure growth plate thickness.

---

# Endocrine Regulation of Growth

- Need appropriate background/setting:
1. Endocrine
2. Thyroid → Low TH = reduced GH
3. Adrenal → High Cortisol = Reduced GH
4. Parathyroid → Low PTH = Reduced GH (As not enough Ca²⁺ is absorbed to facilitate bone mineralisation/growth)
5. Gonadal
- Social:
1. Nutritional
2. Psychological → Higher Brain Centres regulate the PTH
- GH is dominant endocrine regulator of growth.
- However, for first year, growth is largely dependent on nutrition vs GH as GH receptors are only expressed significantly after 7 months of age, after which GH has the predominantly regulator of postnatal growth.

---

# Growth Velocity Chart

- During Puberty, Increased release of Gonadal Hormones increases GHR Sensitivity, to produced increased GH Signalling which causes the Pubertal Growth Spirts
- When puberty ends.
- Sex steroids have ↑:
- Androgens in boys.
- Oestrogens in girls.
- These close growth plates and growth stops due to Sex Steroid signalling driving differentiation of Chondrocytes into Osteoblasts, replacing cartilage with bone.

# Aromatase

- Enzyme aromatase is found in growth plates of boys and girls.
- Fusion of growth plates is oestrogen-dependent in both boys and girls, notably on Oestradiol.
- Aromatase inhibitor administration may help to slow down epiphyseal maturation/growth plate fusion by preventing conversion of Testosterone into Oestradiol, which closes the growth plate, to allow for greater height potential.
- Aromatase inhibitors are a class of drugs that prevents conversion of androgens to oestrogens, notably testosterone into Oestradiol.
- Aromatase inhibitors can be used to delay plate closure in boys, but you would not use them for girls.
- This is because Aromatase Inhibitors cause [Testosterone] to increase, increasing AR binding which will cause excessive masculinisation.
- Achondroplasia is a hereditary congenital disturbance of chondrocyte growth in growth plates, leading to short long bones and limbs.
- This is due to defective receptors for FGF, such that fibroblasts are not responsive to GH.

# Methods of Measurement of GH

### Immunoassay

- ELISA: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, since GH is a 22kDa protein.
- Large-scale routine use.
- Very precise and sensitive, requiring few microlitres of blood.
- Does not measure biological potency directly (whether or not GH is working), only the [GH] → Potency is usually measured by looking at Growth macroscopically.

### Bioassays (As Immunoassay Doesn’t Measure Potency)

- Used to measure potency of new batches of recombinant GH by looking at their effectiveness on GHRs.
- Rarely used to check bioactivity of patient GH.
- In vivo/ hypophysectomised rats/ measure ↑ in growth plate thickness (outdated).
- Insensitive and imprecise.
- In vitro/ immortalised target cells expressing Human GH receptor at High[ ].
- GHRs are tagged to a reporter genes that produces Colorimetric/ luminescent responses when GH binds to and stimulates its receptor
- Curve of Colour Intensity against GH (ml) is then Compared against international growth hormone standard (If Curve is Right Shifted = Less Potent and If Right Shifted = More Potent).

# How Do We Measure Growth?

- Anthropometric measurements.
- 6 examples: yield clinically useful age related problems.

### Height Vs Age

- If Px is <2 years: Measure supine length naked (Px lies down as they can’t stand).
- If Px is >2 years: standing height
1. Use a stadiometer (Base Plate and level height adjusted placed on the top of the head)
2. Careful positioning
3. This produces a very reproducible result (1% CV).
4. Repeat regularly
- Graph Produced → Wobbly trace as we do not grow at a consistent rate before puberty. Then there is an increase in growth rate due to puberty, then stop growing. Eventually shrink a bit with age. Tend to use growth rates instead

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 00.41.55.png](%5B021%5D%20The%20Normal%20Growth%20Hormone%20Axis%20af42450828a7410095d2c6722844a7ae/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_00.41.55.png)

### Growth Rate Vs Age

- This smooths-out the single measurements produced by height that gives a wobbly/variable plot of Height Vs Years before puberty
- Growth Rate is Very high in year 1.
- Plateau followed by growth spurt due to puberty.
- Falls to zero at end of puberty.
- Girls begin puberty earlier than boys and are taller than boys.
- They attain their final height early, then boys go through puberty and attain an average greater final height than girls in a population.

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 00.42.36.png](%5B021%5D%20The%20Normal%20Growth%20Hormone%20Axis%20af42450828a7410095d2c6722844a7ae/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_00.42.36.png)

### Bone Age/Maturation

- Use wrist radiographs to visualise epiphyseal growth plates of the Metacarpals (Lighter areas of Bone on an X-Ray).
- Then compare the size of the epiphyseal growth plates v age related reference ranges.
- Cumulative scores for several bones (2% CV).
- Difficult with skeletal dysplasia as these often cause abnormalities of the growth plate which impact growth (Hard to differentiate between effects of GH and Skeletal Abnormalities on growth/epiphyseal changes)

### Height Vs Chronological Age (Population)

- Appropriate reference population must be used based on characteristics of the Px (E.g Ethnicity).
- This looks at an individuals Chronological Age and Height and compares it to a standard/average curve of Height against Chronological Age for that population
- Sometimes, these curves can be used for Bone Age alongside Chronological Age to look for whether Height Changes from the Norm can be attributed to changes in Bone Maturation (E.g  Bone and Chronological Age below average for that height → Potentially Future Growth Spurt to correct height)
- If a Px has a normal Bone age and abnormal Chronological Age at a specific height, this indicates normal bone development/maturation but altered growth, indicating Growth Disorder
- Distinct Change in Height across generations, producing taller offspring, could be linked to improved nutrition and economic conditions (This is unlikely to be a significant increase in height, unless a genetic mutation is present).

### SD Score

- Standard deviation score: normalised system derived from position of an individual on standard population chart showing height vs chronological age
- 𝑆𝐷 𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = (𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 − 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡)
- SD for that age and sex.
- Normal SDS scores lie between -2 and +2 and beyond this often warranty further clinical intervention

# Pubertal Stages

- Delayed or precocious/early puberty.
- Assessed by staging:
1. Pubis and axillary hair.
2. Development of boy’s external genitalia.
3. Girl’s breast development.

### Tanner Stages

- Conceptually, pubertal maturation can be described in terms of sequence, timing, and tempo (Puberty consists of a series of predictable events, and sequence of changes in secondary sexual characteristics has been categorized by several groups).
- Staging system utilized most frequently is that published by Marshall and Tanner and sequence of changes, commonly
referred to as "Tanner stages”.
- These predict stages of puberty based on a Px’s Physical appearance and development of secondary sexual characteristics

### Boys - Tanner Stages

- Development of external genitalia.
- Orchidometer: estimate testes size and volume (Has come up in OCaPE before apparently)

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Prepubertal |
| 2 | Enlargement of Scrotum and Testes. Scrotum skin reddens and changes texture |
| 3 | Enlargement of Penis (Length at First). Further Growth of Testes |
| 4 | Increased Penis Size with Growth in Breadth and Development of Glans. Testes and Scrotum become Larger. Scrotum Skin becomes Darker |
| 5 | Adult Genitalia |

### Girls - Tanner Stages

- Breast Development

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Prepubertal |
| 2 | Breast bud stage with elevation of the Breast and Papilla. Enlargement of the Areola |
| 3 | Further enlargement of the Breast and Areola. No separation of their contour |
| 4  | Areola and Nipple form a secondary mound above the level of the breast |
| 5 | Mature Stage - Projection of Papilla, related to recession of Areola |

### Boys and Girls

- Pubic Hair Stage

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Prepubertal (Can see Velus hair, similar to the Abdominal Wall) |
| 2 | Sparse growth of long, slightly pigmented hair, straight or curled, at the base of the Penis or along the Labia |
| 3 | Darker, Coarse and more curled hair, spreading sparsely over the junction of the Pubes |
| 4 | Hair adult in type, but covering smaller area than in adults. No spreading to medial thigh |
| 5 | Adult in type and quantity |

---

# Final Conclusions

- Anthropometric measurements:
1. Allow us to construct well established reference relationships for a given population.
2. An individual child can then be compared against these to assess whether they suffer from a growth disorder or not.
