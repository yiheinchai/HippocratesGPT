Progress: Not started

# Water Content

- Male TBW Content (60%) > Female TBW Content (55%) as Females have more adipose tissue than men, which contains far less water than other cells
- To excrete metabolic waste products, we must produce at least 500 ml of Urine each day
- ADH is secreted during deep sleep
- Water is rapidly absorbed by the GI Tract but not from the Stomach so rapid gastric emptying increases water delivery to the GI Tract, allowing for more rapid water absorption â†’ Hence, Rate of Gastric Emptying and Intestinal Absorption influence the rate of Urine Excretion
- Glucose is rapidly removed from the Portal Circulation by the Liver to prevent Hyperglycaemia in the Systemic Circulation
- Under Normal Circumstances, Sodium is confined to the Extracellular Compartment
