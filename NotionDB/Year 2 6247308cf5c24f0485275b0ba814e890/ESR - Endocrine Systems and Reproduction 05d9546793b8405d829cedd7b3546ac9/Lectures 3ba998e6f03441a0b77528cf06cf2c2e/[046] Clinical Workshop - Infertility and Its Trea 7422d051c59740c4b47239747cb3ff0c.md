# [046] Clinical Workshop - Infertility and Its Treatment

Progress: Not started

# Infertility and Its Causes

### Infertility

- Inability to conceive after 1 year of regular unprotected intercourse.
- Most GPs will refer couple after 1 year but if there is a woman with additional risk factors for infertility (>35 etc.), there might be referral after 6 months.

### Causes

- Ovulatory disorder (25%).
- Tubal damage (20%): chlamydia, history of endometriosis.
- Uterine or peritoneal disorders (10%).
- Male factor (30%) → Often main cause of subfertility.
- Unexplained (25%)

# Natural Decline and Anovulation

### Natural Decline

- As women are born with all their possible oocytes, there is a limited supply of Gametes for women and hence, as they are released over the life, fertility declines with age
- As maternal age ↑:
1. ↓ fertility (most significantly >35)
2. ↑ spontaneous abortions (45-50% for women > 35 years) → Due to ageing of the eggs (This means IVF becomes less successful with age).
3. ↑ risk of Down’s syndrome and chromosomal abnormalities.
4. ↓ number of follicles, notably Secondary Follicles (↑ rate of loss post-35 years).
5. ↓ AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone) is produced by follicles, and reflects ovarian reserve/number of eggs in the ovary.

### Anovulation

- When ovaries do not release oocyte during menstrual cycle
- Causes of Anovulation may be:
1. Low Number of Follicles within the Ovary

# Acting on the Hypothalamus, Anterior Pituitary Gland and Ovary

### Hypothalamus

- Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism: low levels of FSH and LH being produces, so follicle is not recruited.
1. Idiopathic
2. Reversible Inhibition of GnRH Release in Stress/Exercise/Anorexia → The effects of these on GnRH Inhibition and lack of Pulsatility may persist for several months after recovery
3. Permanent Inhibition of GnRH Release in Kallman’s Syndrome where GnRH Neurons fail to migrate to the Hypothalamus or produce GnRH

### Anterior Pituitary Gland

1. Space-Occupying Pituitary Tumour (Functional or Non-Functional) that compresses and hence, reduces the function of Gonadotrophs
2. Sheehan’s Syndrome → Excessive Haemorrhage during or after delivery can lead to Ischaemia and Necrosis of the Pituitary Gland, leading to Maternal Hypopituitarism 
3. Hypothyroidism

### Ovary

- PCOS → Insulin Resistance and abnormal FSH:LH
- Gonadal dysgenesis/agenesis:
1. 45X (Turner): 1 X chromosome is missing.
2. Mosaics
3. 47,XXX
4. 46,XX (Perault syndrome)
5. 46XY (Swyer’s syndrome) → Genetically Male but Gonads do not differentiate so testes do not form
- Resistant ovarian syndrome
- Premature ovarian failure: anyone < 40 years running out of follicles (premature Menopause).
1. Idiopathic
2. Secondary to treatment (E.g Chemotherapy)

---

# PCOS and Tubal Factor

### PCOS

- Weight gain and genetic background → hyperinsulinaemia → ↑ ovarian androgen production and ↓ SHBG → ↑ free androgen concentration.
- However, 25-50% of PCOS patients have no insulin resistance.
- Dx = Sx of Oligomenorrhoea, Signs of Raised Androgen Levels (Hirsutism, Acne etc.) and Polycystic Appearance on Ultrasound

### Fallopian Tubal Factor

- Pelvis inflammatory disease (50%):
1. Chlamydia
2. Genital tuberculosis
- Endometriosis
- Intratubal debris: cells being deposited within fallopian tube.
- Salpingitis isthmica nodose.

# Endometriosis

- Sx = Normal Periods and Regular Cycles with Dysmenorrhoea (Painful Periods) and Dyspareunia (Painful Intercourse)
- Migration of Endometrial Tissue into the Pelvic Tissue which becomes inflamed monthly as it is under the same hormonal control by Oestrogen and Progesterone as normal endometrial tissue
- It can be superficial but can be deeper, causing Pelvic Nodules and Ovarian Cysts
- Superficial Endometriosis (Endometriosis on the Peritoneum) can affect Spontaneous Conception and can be treated by Rx
- Migration of Endometrial Tissue into the Fallopian Tubes can cause tubular pathology
- Endometrial Adhesions due to Endometriosis can distort Pelvic Anatomy that can compromise fertility options (E.g Unable to Access Ovary transvaginally to extract eggs for IVF)
- There is not a correlation between Severity of Sx and Severity of Nodules/Lesions
- Diagnosis: through laparoscopy or ultrasound.
- Treatment: surgical resection or heat ligation.

# Uterine Factors

- Embryo tends to implant in the Upper 1/3rd of the Uterine Cavity in the Endometrium therefore, factors that affect the Uterus can impact Implantation and hence, Fertility
- Adenomyosis is where there is Endometrial Tissue that migrates into the Myometrium (Can also present with Dysmenorrhoea)
- There is a correlation between severity of Adenomyosis and degree of Infertility
- Uterine Septum (Persistence of the Uterine Septum, that usually degenerates during embryogenesis) can impair fertility and increase miscarriage risk

---

# Fibroid

- Muscular growths within the Uterus
- Fibroid position: sub-serosal (on the Outer Aspect of the Uterus), intra-mural (within Myometrium) and submucosal (protruding within cavity).
- Causes infertility if only obstructing tube, most common with Submucosal Fibroids, therefore, Submucosal Fibroids if there is a risk/Sx of Infertility.

---

# Endometrial Factor

- Ashermans → Interuterine Adhesions, usually due to Inflammation
- Genital tuberculosis (50%)
- Isthmic occlusion
- Beaded tubes
- Adhesion

---

# Psychosocial

- Dyspareunia → Woman less likely to have sex
- Vaginismus: woman complains of spasm during intercourse, causing pain.
- Erectile dysfunction

---

# Dx

- Menarche
- Cycle:
1. Regularity
2. Symptomatology (Dysmenorrhoea, Dyspareunia, Menorrhagia → Menorrhagia may suggests Submucosal Fibroid or Polyp)
- Coital frequency:
1. Dysmenorrhea
- Past medial/gynaecological/obstetrics history.
- Medications: NSAIDs affect ovulation, teratogenicity.

---

# Examination

- BMI > 30: obesity ↑ risk of infertility and Miscarriage.
- Galactorrhea: excess milk production → Hyperprolactinaemia.
- Acanthosis nigricans: dark velvety discolouration in body folds and creases.
- Acne → Hypernandrogenism
- Hirsutism: excess body hair (chin, jaw, lower abdomen, upper thigh, upper back) → Hyperandrogenism
- Short stature: Turner syndrome.
- Webbed neck: Turner syndrome (pathognomic).

---

# Ix

- BMI
- Bloods:
1. Day 2-5 (follicular stage) serum gonadotrophins → As FSH and LH Rise at the Menstrual Period and rise in the Follicular/Proliferative Phase, Ensure to take Serum LH and FSH early to distinguish between Pathologically and Physiologically raised LH and FSH.
2. Thyroid function test - Hypothyroidism can impair LH and FSH Secretion, with TSH > 2.5 (Can be seen in Subclinical Hypothyroidism) being associated with worse outcome of pregnancy.
3. Serum prolactin: important to assess if women is not having periods.
4. Serum testosterone: high if women has PCOS.
5. AMH: produced by Granulosa Cells of Resting follicles, and gives an idea of ovarian reserve.
6. Day 21 progesterone: If a woman has a 28 day cycle, Progesterone Levels should be raised on Day 21 due to Progesterone Secretion by the Corpus Luteum → High level suggests ovulation (But this can often be inaccurate as women do not always have 28 day cycles and hence, Sample may not be taken during Physiological Rise in Progesterone secondary to ovulation) → Usually Regularity of Cycle is enough to confirm Ovulation.
- Semen analysis
- Ideally for fertility, you want 15 million sperm/ml, with >50% Motile Sperm with 4% Normal Morphology Sperm

---

# Ultrasound

- Uterine morphology: Visualise any fibroids, obstructions.
- Ovarian morphology (Look at Follicular Number and Visualise Graafian Follicle and Corpus Luteum) and Secondary/Antral follicle count.

---

# Ovarian Reserve Testing

- Consists of analysis of AMH, FSH and the Antral/Secondary Follicle Count
- AMH is positively correlated with Follicle Number whereas FSH is Inversely correlated with Follicle Number
- To guide what treatment to give, and whether eligible for IVF as when Secondary Follicle Count Decreases, the number of Ova that can be extracted during IVF Decreases, reducing the chance of a successful life birth (Success of IVF) .

---

# Assessing Tubal Patency → Ix of Possible Tubal Pathology

- Laparoscopy and dye test (Gold standard) → Dye is inserted via the Cervical Canal and see if the Dye passes through the entirety of the tube to visualise an obstruction which can be corrected laparoscopically at the same time → Often done when Sx and Hx are highly suggestive of Tubal Pathology.
- If Px may have Tubal Pathology but there are no strong indications in the Hx or Sx, Less Invasive Ix might be suggested such as:
1. Hysterosalpingo contrast sonography (HyCoSy).
2. Hysterosalpingogram (HSG): X-ray after injecting dye through cervical canal
- Main Drawback to these scans is that lack of invasiveness means that Tubal Pathology cannot be corrected immediately upon visualisation

---

# Assessing Endometrium

- Progesterone challenge
- Hysteroscopy: Hysteroscope is inserted through the vagina to visualise the cervix and uterus, allowing for surgical correction at the time if there is visualisation of Uterine or Cervical Pathology
- Ultrasound scan: put saline into the Uterus to open the Uterine Cavity cavity, then do an ultrasound scan to visualise fibroids or polyps.

---

# Treatments for Infertility

- Anovulation: Initially Rx underlying cause if Dx or reducing Risk Factors (E.g Normalising BMI), then ovulation inducting medicines
1. Clomid/Chlomiphene → SERM that weakly antagonises the Oestrogen receptor on Gonadotrophs to increase LH and FSH Release from the Anterior Pituitary
2. Exogenous FSH and LH via IV
- After administration of FSH, Scan the woman over the next few days to identify the Graafian Follicle and then give LH to trigger Ovulation to ensure effective Ovulation
- Uterine Tx (Notably for those who have had to have Hysterectomies or Uterine Agenesis
- IVF: Ovaries are stimulated by FSH to stimulate the production of Multiple Graafian Follicles. Exogenous LH is then given to induce Ovulation of Multiple Ova, which are then collected with an injection through vagina, and then aspirate eggs.
- Fertilise egg using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (usually when sperm is poor quality) or insemination (surround
egg with sperm).
- Grow to blastocyst (day 5/6) then choose best one for implantation.
- Intracytoplasmic sperm injection: when sperm quality or quantity is low (unable to spontaneously fertilise ovum without assistance), sperm is directly injected into the Cytoplasm of the Egg.
- Insemination is used when there are no spermal abnormalities, so spontaneous fertilisation is possible
- Embryo Biopsy - When the Zygote a blastocyst, one of the Blastomeres can be removed and tested to identify genetic/chromosomal mutations
