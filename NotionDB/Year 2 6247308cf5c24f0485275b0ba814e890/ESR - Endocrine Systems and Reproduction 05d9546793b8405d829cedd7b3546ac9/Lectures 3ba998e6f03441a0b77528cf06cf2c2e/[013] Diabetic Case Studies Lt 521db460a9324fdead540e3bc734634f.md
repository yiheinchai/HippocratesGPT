# Symptoms

### Polydipsia

- Polydipsia arises from Increased Plasma Osmolarity (Due to Hyperglycaemia) and and decreased Plasma and ECF Volume
- As Glucose is freely permeable across cell membranes, it is not detected and corrected by Central Osmoreceptors in the Brain, causing no change in Neuronal Cell Volume and hence, no activation of the Thirst/ADH mechanism
- Thirst arises as Hyperglycaemia causes of Loss of Water from Kidneys due to unreabsorbed Glucose (Osmotic Diuresis).
- Due to increased Filtrate Volume due to Osmotic Diuresis, Tubular Flow Rate increases, reducing NaCl reabsorption.
- This causes ECF volume to decrease which triggers thirst and ADH Release
- As the loss of water is proportionately greater than the loss of NaCl, this causes Extracellular [NaCl] to rise (Hypernatraemia), which stimulates thirst and ADH

### Weight Loss

- Inability to metabolise glucose due to Reduced Glucose Uptake (via Insulin Stimulation) increased Fat and Protein Catabolism, causing weight loss
- Osmotic Diuresis due to Unreabsorbed Glucose in the Urine causes Reduced ECF Volume and causes Hypernatraemia due to increased relative NaCl uptake
- Hypernatraemia and Hyperglycaemia draws water from Cells (Notably cells like Muscle where Insulin Signalling is required for Glucose Uptake, not affecting Non-Insulin Sensitive cells), causing ICF to drop
- The combination of falling ICF and ECF causes significant weight loss

### Diuresis

- Polyruria occurs due to Osmotic Diuresis as Hyperglycaemia increases [Glucose] in Glomerular Filtrate.
- This high [Glucose] in the Filtrate means that not all the Glucose can be reabsorbed, increasing the Osmolarity of the Urine and hence, causing Increased Urine Volume due to Osmotic Diuresis

### Renal Handling of Glucose in T1DM

1. Hyperglycaemia causes increased Glomerular Filtration of Glucose
2. Renal Tubular Glucose Reabsorptive Capacity is exceeded due to raised [Glucose] in Glomerular FIltrate
3. Glucose remains in the Tubular Fluid, holding water with it Osmotically
4. Increased Filtrate Volume  increases the rate at which fluid is delivered to the Distal Nephron segments, which decreases contact time with Tubular Cells here
5. Decreased Contact time results in decreased NaCl Secretion
6. This leads to Osmotic Diuresis with Losses of Glucose and NaCl

# Management of Childhood Diabetes

- Carbohydrate Counting → Measuring Amount of Carbohydrate in Food Item and Adjusting Insulin dose accordingly to minimise Postprandial Hyperglycaemia and Hypoglycaemia
- Insulin Dose can be deduced by Insulin:Carb Ration (How many Grams of Carbs need to be ingested to keep [Glucose] constant when 1g of Insulin is administered) and Correction Factor (Indicates how many mmol/L [Glucose] Falls by when 1 Unit of Insulin is given)
- Children should eat normally so Px don’t feel restricted in their diet and so there isn’t an increase in the Risk of Eating Disorders that is usually associated with the increased focus on eating and Weight Gain associated with Good Glycaemic Control in T1DM

# Type 1 Diabetes

- Acute Complications = Hypoglycaemia, Hyperglycaemia and Diabetic Ketoacidosis
- Chronic Complications = Retinopathy, Nephropathy, MI, Stroke and Autonomic and Peripheral Neuropathy

# Hypoglycaemia and Hyperglycaemia

### Hypoglycaemia (SNS Response)

- Tremors
- Sweating
- Tachycardia
- Anxiety and Confusion
- Incoordination
- Pallor
- These arise due to increased Secretion of Glucagon and Adrenaline (to try increase Blood [Glucose]) and decreased energy available to the Brain, activating the SNS which produces Sx

### Hyperglycaemia

- Blurry Vision
- Excessive Thirst
- Polyuria

# Ketoacidosis

1. Lipid Catabolism produces increased quantities of Acetyl CoA
2. Lack of Krebs Cycle Substrates causes Excess Acetyl CoA to be redirected into Ketogenic Pathways within the Liver
3. Acetyl CoA is metabolised into Acetoacetate and β-Hydroxybutyrate, which accumulate in the blood
4. These are weak acids, causing blood pH to fall to cause a Metabolic Acidosis
- Ketoacidosis can cause Coma and Tachypnoea, with Ketones being detectable in the Urine and Acetone on the Breath → Both of these smell fruity
- Rx = IV Fluids to replace fluid lost via urination and Insulin to Lower Blood [Glucose] to inhibit Ketogenesis.
- As Insulin stimulates K⁺ Influx into Cells, K⁺ is sometimes added to Replacement Fluid and Plasma [K⁺] is monitored to minimise the risk of Hypokalaemia with Insulin Therapy

# Treatment

- Insulin can be given as a Pump that has a slow Insulin Infusion Rate over the Period of the Day to allow for Basal [Glucose] Control with Insulin Infusion being adjusted before meals in order to prevent Postprandial Hyperglycaemia
- This does require the need for Carbohydrate Counting to correctly calculate Required Insulin Boluses to prevent Hypo or Hyperglycaemia
- it is important to Teach Px how to sterilise the area and resite the cannula herself, care for wounds, how to estimate and count carbohydrates and provide instructions on how to use the pump
