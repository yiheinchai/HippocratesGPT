# Ca²⁺ Regulation

- Ca²⁺ is critical for:
    1. Bone mineralisation
    2. Blood clotting
    3. Muscle contraction
    4. Enzyme action
    5. Exocytosis of hormones and neurotransmitters.
    6. Nerve function
    7. Intracellular signalling
- Around 1Kg of Calcium is found in the body, stored in bone as Hydroxyapatite in Bone, with intake and excretion of Calcium being regulated between the Gut (uptake and excretion), ECF (active/exchange pool), Kidney (excretion) and bone (storage)
- When more or less Calcium is required, there is a balance between the pool of active Calcium in the ECF and that which is excreted in Urine/Faeces
- The majority of Calcium not stored within bone is distributed in Intracellular, Interstitial and Plasma Fluid in increasing concentrations
- In the serum, Half of it is ionised and the other half is bound to Albumin

# Ca²⁺  Balance

- Under normal circumstances, Ca²⁺ is in equilibrium across different ‘pool’ in body such as bones (largest store), circulation (very small amount), tissues and organs.
- During childhood, overall Ca²⁺ balance is +ve as bone is being formed.
- In growing children, intestinal absorption > renal excretion (+ve balance) (~ 10 mmol/day), causing progressive increases in Calcium stores.
- In post-menopausal women, output (from bone) is greater than input, putting Ca²⁺ in -ve balance, gradually decreasing calcium stores.
- Ca²⁺ is in part regulated with phosphate. However, a higher proportion of PO₄³⁻ than Ca²⁺ is absorbed from diet and so as a result, more PO₄³⁻ is excreted in urine than Calcium .

---

# Control of Ca²⁺ Homeostasis

- Serum Ca²⁺ levels are maintained within narrow limits, main factors responsible are listed:

| Hormone | Produced By... | Cell Type | Effect on Ca²⁺ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Parathyroid Hormone | Parathyroid Gland | Chief Cell | ↑ |
| Calcitriol (Active Vitamin D) | Skin (Calciciol) → Liver (Calcidiol) → Kidney (Calcitriol) | Various | ↑ |
| Calcitonin | Thyroid Gland | C Cells | ↓ |
- PTH increases [Calcium] in Blood by breaking down bone to release stored Calcium, increasing Calcium Absorption and Phosphate Lost in the Kidney
- It can indirectly activate Calcitriol to further increase Calcium Absorption by increasing Calcium Absorption in the GI Tract
- C-Cells do not pick up stain and hence, appear clear in the Thyroid

---

# Ca²⁺ Homeostasis

- Derangements of Ca²⁺ homeostasis lead to hypercalcaemia or hypocalcaemia, both of which can have important consequences for health.
- When blood Ca²⁺ levels ↑, thyroid gland releases calcitonin, lowering blood Ca²⁺ levels.
- When blood Ca²⁺ levels fall, parathyroid gland releases parathyroid hormones (PTH), to ↑ blood Ca²⁺ levels.

---

# Ca²⁺ Sensing Receptor (In a Range of Tissues)

- Tissue distribution:
    1. Parathyroid chief cells: produce parathyroid hormone. As soon as Ca²⁺ levels are ↓, parathyroid hormone is
    produced to ↑ Ca²⁺ levels.
    2. Renal proximal tubule.
    3. Nephron segments
    4. Gastrointestinal tract
    5. Osteoblast/osteoclast
    6. Monocytes/macrophages
    7. Nervous system
    8. Bone marrow
    9. Cardiovascular tissue

# Parathyroid Glands

- Normally 4 glands embedded in rear face of thyroid.
- Anatomical position can be variable.
- Sometimes, additional Parathyroid Gland can arise where they are generally found in the Midline, along their migration path in development
- 40-60 mg
- Abnormalities may occur in 1 in 10 glands.
- Histologically, PTH Gland appears denser and more granulated than Thyroid TIssue (appears relative amorphous due to large Colloid pools in Follicles)

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 01.33.00.png](%5B024%5D%20Endocrine%20Control%20of%20Calcium%20Homeostasis%20c5bd95fb8c114b7fb41c3876ae271421/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_01.33.00.png)

# Parathyroid Hormone (Produced by Parathyroid Gland)

- Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an 84 amino acid single chain protein that is released from chief cell in parathyroid glands.
- Secretion is regulated via vitamin D.
- Magnesium (cofactor in production of parathyroid hormone), adrenaline, and histamine affect PTH release:
1. Longstanding hypomagnesaemia inhibit PTH synthesis and impairs PTH actions in target tissues.
2. Adrenaline and histamine both stimulate PTH release via specific receptors.
- Main actions of PTH are to ↑ plasma Ca²⁺   and ↓ plasma phosphate.
- This is accomplished through a direct effect on bone (↑ Ca²⁺ and phosphate → Bulk Release of Hydroxyapatite components) and kidneys (↑ Ca²⁺ and ↓ phosphate → Fine tunes Calcium and Phosphate Levels to decrease Phosphate and Maintain Calcium levels) and an indirect effect on GI tract via Vitamin D.

---

# PTH Actions

- Bone: PTH promotes recruitment and differentiation of osteoclasts, therefore ↑ breakdown of bone mineral and
degradation of bone collagen.
- ↑ Ca²⁺ leads to -ve feedback which
acts on Ca²⁺ sensing receptors on parathyroid gland.
- Also ↑ phosphate.
- Kidney: PTH blocks reabsorption of phosphate at proximal tubule stimulating an ↑ in phosphate excretion and ↑ reabsorption of Ca²⁺ from distal tubule.
- Final steps of vitamin D activation occurs in kidney and are dependent on PTH Activity (Rate Limiting Step).
- PTH stimulates 1𝛼 hydroxylation of 25-hydroxivitamin D to produce 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (which is biologically active).
- Gastrointestinal tract: PTH stimulates 1𝛼 hydroxylation of 25 hydroxyvitamin to produce active 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D.
- This then acts to ↑ GI absorption of Ca²⁺ and phosphate.
- High Ca²⁺, active vitamin D and low phosphate levels all act via -ve feedback on PTH gland to maintain homeostasis and Calcium stores in bone.
- ↑ Vitamin D can also upregulate FGF23 which ↓ PTH production to contribute to negative feedback.

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 01.35.36.png](%5B024%5D%20Endocrine%20Control%20of%20Calcium%20Homeostasis%20c5bd95fb8c114b7fb41c3876ae271421/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_01.35.36.png)

- If Ca²⁺ levels are high, then calcitonin secretion is stimulated, to ↓ Ca²⁺ levels.
- If Ca²⁺ levels are high, parathyroid
gland chief cells stimulated to release PTH which ↑ Ca²⁺ by osteoclast activity.
- PTH also stimulates release of calcitriol by kidney to stimulate absorption of Ca²⁺ from food, to ↑ Ca²⁺ levels.

# Hypercalcaemic Action of PTH

- Serum Ca²⁺ is the main regulator of Secretion
- Hypercalcaemia inhibits secretion (hypocalcaemia stimulates secretion).
- PTH ↑ bone resorption by osteoclasts.
- PTH ↑ renal tubule reabsorption of Ca²⁺ (Ca²⁺ excretion may ↑ because of greater filtered load due to hypercalcaemia induced by action of PTH on bone), due to Ca²⁺ sensing receptor in kidney, to ↑ uptake and ↓ excretion of Ca²⁺ in kidney.
- ↑ phosphate excretion, lowering serum phosphate and so ↑ serum Ca²⁺.
- Hypocalcaemia: causes ↑ excitability of nerve tissue, paraesthesia, tetany, and sometimes epilepsy.
- This is treated with Ca²⁺ supplements and calcitriol to increase Calcium Levels to establish Normocalaemia

---

# PTH Acts via Cell Surface Receptors

- On osteoclasts
- On antiluminal/basolateral surface of renal tubules.
- Linked to adenylyl cyclase and formation of cAMP.
- It is secreted at a continuous level and has a rapid clearance from the circulation (t1/2 5 min).

---

# Hyperparathyroidism

### Primary Hyperparathyroidism

- Benign tumour of 1 or more parathyroid glands.
- Tumour associated with excess PTH hormone production.
- Causes weak bones, due to resorption via osteoclasts

### Secondary Hyperparathyroidism

- Raised PTH is usually due to compensation for long-standing hypocalcaemia in an attempt to increase Ca²⁺ uptake to establish normocalcaemia.
- Hypocalaemia can arise due to:
    1. Poor Ca²⁺ intake/absorption.
    2. Low calcitriol seen in chronic renal failure due to failure of final activation step of Vit D in the Kidneys.
        - Increase Bone resorption due to Increased PTH can cause Sub-periosteal bone reabsorption which may lead to cyst formation and bone pain.
        - Higher levels of Calcium and Phosphate means that Calcium Phosphate can precipitate in kidneys to produce Renal calculi (Ca₃(PO₄)₂) stones).
        - These are extremely painful with movement

---

# Hypoparathyroidism

1. Iatrogenic
    - Accidental removal of parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery (E.g Extensive Medullary Carcinoma where whole thyroid is removed)
    - Parathyroid gland should be resected and replaced under capsule when thyroid gland is removed.
    - Sometimes removed by mistake.
2. Idiopathy
    - No known cause for failure of PTH secretion.
    - **Low circulating PTH**, hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia
3. Pseudohypoparathyroidism
    - Tissue resistance to PTH action due to lack of receptor action.
    - This is usually due to mutations in bone and kidney PTH receptors.
    - **High circulating PTH**, hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia.

---

# Parathyroidectomy

- Need for surgical parathyroidectomy in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism has ↓ significantly in recent years.
- This is because of ↑ efficacy of treatments to suppress PTH secretion, especially using vitamin D.
- [Image] Parathyroid scan (with technetium Tc99m-MIBI) demonstrating uptake in all 4 glands consistent with 4-gland hyperplasia.
- Radiolabelling of Hyperactive Parathyroid Glands allows for selective removal of Hyperactive Gland whilst keeping Normal Glands intact to minimise effects of surgery on PTH Secretion
- Overactive Glands will uptake greater quantities of the Radioisotope and can be distinguished from normal Parathyroid Glands in surgery by using a Geiger Counter (More Radioactivity = More Activity)
- Main indications for surgery include therapy-resistant hypercalcaemia.

# Calcitonin

- Secreted by parafollicular/C cells (between thyroid follicles) of thyroid, so called because they are clear or lightly staining.
- C cells are embryologically distinct from thyroid cells and stain much lighter/clear in comparison to the follicles.
- They are derived from neural crest.
- These are amine precursor uptake and decarboxylating (APUD) cells → Old Name.
- C-Cell Tumours can occur in combination with others such as Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN):
    1. Tumours arising in > 1 endocrine organ.
    2. MEN-I: arise from cells that do not develop from neural crest.
    3. MEN-II: arise from cells that develop from neural crest.
- 32-amino acid peptide, but calcitonin gene codes for 136 amino acids and are heavily spliced in a tissue specific manner to produce tissue specific isoforms.
- Acts to ↓ serum Ca²⁺ by inhibiting bone mobilisation, by inhibiting osteoclast activity (so it is more balanced with OB activity) and hence, bone demineralisation.
- Calcitonin acts to reduce bone turnover due to Osteoclast inhibition
- Secretion of Calcitonin is ↑ in response to hypercalcaemia.
- Patients with medullary cancer of thyroid (C cell tumour):
    1. May be familial or not.
    2. These may be isolated or associated with a tumour of chromaffin cells of adrenal medulla/Phaeochromocytoma (and hence in MEN II) have very high circulating calcitonin but normal serum Ca²⁺ as any hypocalcaemia induced by Calcitonin activity is corrected by PTH activity

# Vitamin D

- ‘Vitamin D’ is used to describe various forms of vitamin D present at different stages of hydroxylation.
- Stage of hydroxylation has a profound effect of activity of hormone and therefore is important to state which vitamin D is referred to.
- Dehydrocholesterol is converted into Pre-Vitamin D in the skin on exposure to UV-B radiation, which is slowly converted to Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3) via Slow Thermal Isomerisation.
- Native vitamin D, which can include cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), can be hydroxylated in the liver to 25 hydroxyvitamin D (calcidol) and stored here → Hepatic Hydroxylation.
- The 25 hydroxyvitamin D is then  transported to the kidney, where it is hydroxylated to 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) by 1α Hydroxylase→ Renal Hydroxylation.
- Excessive sunlight exposure does not lead to excessive formation of Vitamin D
- In countries at Latitudes above 40**°**N, UV-B intensity in the winter is too low for any significant formation of Cholecalciferol and hence, a large proportion of the UK population is believed to Vitamin D Deficient following winter
- The wavelength for previtamin D formation is 290- 320nm (UV-B), but at 310nm, formation is only 1% of the peak at 296.5nm

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 01.45.23.png](%5B024%5D%20Endocrine%20Control%20of%20Calcium%20Homeostasis%20c5bd95fb8c114b7fb41c3876ae271421/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_01.45.23.png)

- Calciol (Cholecalciferol) -Calciol 25-Hydroxylase→ Calcidiol (25, Hydroxycholecalciferol) -Calcidiol 1-Hydroxylase/1α Hydroxylase (PTH Regulated)→ Calcitriol
- As Vitamin D Precursors can be stored under the skin or in the Liver, there is a large capacity for Vitamin D Production within the Body
- Vitamin D activity within the body can be adapted by local regulation of Renal enzymes that degrade/inactivate Active Vitamin D
- 24-hydroxylase in the Kidney is stimulated by high levels of Ca²⁺, to convert Calcidiol/25-Hydroxycholecalciferol into 24-Hydroxycalcidiol or Calcitriol into Calcitetrol.
- 24-Hydroxycalcidiol can be converted into 1,24-Dihydroxy Vitamin D/Calcitetrol
- Hypocalcaemia-Induced Release of PTH stimulates Active Vitamin D Synthesis by activating 1α Hydroxylase

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 01.46.56.png](%5B024%5D%20Endocrine%20Control%20of%20Calcium%20Homeostasis%20c5bd95fb8c114b7fb41c3876ae271421/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_01.46.56.png)

# Calcitriol (Dihydroxyvitamin D)

- Most active metabolite of vitamin D and has direct effects on parathyroid gland by suppressing synthesis and secretion of PTH and limiting parathyroid cell growth.
- This is to prevent hypercalcaemia due to Calcium release via Bone Resporption (PTH) Increased Calcium Absorption in the GI Tract (Vit D)
- Can be administered orally and intravenously for treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism to oppose the activity of PTH.
- It may cause hyperphosphataemia and hypercalcaemia by ↑ secretion of both Ca²⁺ and phosphate.
- Calcitriol can cause hyperphosphataemia/hypercalcaemia although new vitamin D analogues are relatively selective for parathyroid gland with lesser effects on intestinal absorption of Ca²⁺ and phosphate, therefore ↓ PTH secretion without affecting bone turnover.

---

# Hydroxylation of Vitamin D

- Inactivation of Active vitamin D occurs in kidney by 24-hydroxylation to 1,24,25-trihydroxyvitamin D.
- 24-hydroxylase also acts on 25- hydroxyvitamin D to form 24,25 dihydroxyvitamin D.
- 24-hydroxy-metabolites may play a role in bone development but not calcium and phosphate homeostasis (no clear function is apparent in adulthood.
- Calcitriol stimulates 24-hydroxylase and inhibits 1𝛼-hydroxylase to prevent excessive Calcium and Phosphate reabsorption.
- PTH stimulates 1𝛼 hydrolase, therefore, calcitriol, rather than cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol needs to be given to treat hypocalcaemia secondary to hypoparathyroidism as the Px is unable to convert precursors into Active Vit D/Calcitriol.
- Calcitonin suppresses 1𝛼-hydroxylase to lower Calcium Levels, whereas growth hormone, cortisol, oestrogen and prolactin ↑ activity to increase Calcium absorption to facilitate anabolic processes such as growth and milk production.
- There is reciprocal activation of 1𝛼 hydroxylase and 24-hydroxylase in kidney by Calcium and Phosphate Levels to tightly regulate Active Vitamin D levels at a specific tissue.
- This means that Hypocalaemia stimulates 1α-Hydroxylase and Inhibits 24-Hydroxylase (To increase [Active Vit D] and hence, increase Calcium Reabsorption) whereas Hypercalcaemia does the opposite to decrease [Active Vit D] and hence, decrease Calcium Reabsorption
- Hypophosphataemia stimulates 1α-Hydroxylase and Inhibits 24-Hydroxylase (To increase [Active Vit D] and hence, increase Phosphate Reabsorption) whereas Hyperphosphataemia inhibits 1α-Hydroxylase and stimulates 24-Hydroxylase to lower [Active Vit D] and hence, decrease Phosphate Reabsorption

---

# Calcitriol (Vitamin D) Deficiency

- Kidney is major site for calcitriol production as Renal 1α-Hydroxylation is the rate limiting and final step of Calcitrol synthesis.
- Calcitriol has several direct and indirect effects on parathyroid glands.
- Vitamin D receptors (VDR) in parathyroid glands are down regulated as a consequence of low levels of calcitriol and hence, [Vit D] and VDR expression are tightly coupled.
- This direct mechanism leads to stimulation of PTH gene expression and ↑ PTH secretion.
- Administration of calcitriol ↑ VDR in parathyroid glands, increasing Vitamin D Activity which inhibits PTH secretion.
- Low circulating calcitriol may facilitate parathyroid cell proliferation.
- Thus, calcitriol deficiency (i.e. renal disease) indirectly leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism due to parathyroid cell proliferation.

---

# Hypervitaminosis D

- Rare and potentially serious.
- Occurs when taking too much vitamin D.
- Causes abnormally high levels of Ca²⁺ and phosphate in the blood which can precipitate out of circulation and lead to hypertension, bone loss, kidney damage and calcification of internal organs.

### Cause

- Does not come from food or exposure to sun but rather supplementation.
- Usually due to taking more than recommended daily value of vitamin D from supplements, combined with other existing health problems (kidney disease, liver disease, tuberculosis, hyperparathyroidism).
- Some prescription medications used to treat hypertension (thiazide diuretics) and heart disease (digoxin) can cause an ↑ in vitamin D in blood.
- Oestrogen therapy, long-term antacids and isoniazide (antituberculotic medication) can all cause ↑ levels of vitamin D.

### Long Term Complications of Untreated Hypervitaminosis D

- Kidney stones/calculi
- Kidney damage
- Kidney failure
- Excess bone loss.
- Calcification of arteries and soft tissues.
- ↑ blood Ca²⁺ can cause abnormal heart rhythms.

### Treatment

- Stop taking vitamin D supplements immediately.
- ↓ amount of Ca²⁺ in diet temporarily.
- In some cases, corticosteroids or bisphosphonates can be used to
suppress release of Ca²⁺ from bone by inhibiting Osteoclasts.
- Monitor vitamin D levels frequently until they return to normal.

---

# Hypercalcaemia

### Signs and Symtoms

- ‘Stones, Bones, Groans, Thrones and Psychiatric Overtones)
- Stones (renal or biliary calcium phosphate precipitates).
- Bones (bone pain associated with bone resorption).
- Groans (abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting due to alterations of Calcium absorption in the GI Tract).
- Thrones (polyuria)
- Psychiatric overtones (depression, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, insomnia, coma).
- Neuromuscular symptoms of hypercalcaemia are caused by Ca²⁺
blocking Na⁺ channels which inhibits depolarisation of nerve and muscle fibres.
- Hypercalcaemia ↓ HR but ↑ contractility which can show as a short QT interval on ECG.
- ↑ gastrin production may ↑ acidity and lead to peptic ulcers which can contribute to abdominal pain.

---

# Hypocalcaemia

- Stimulates release of PTH directly by inactivation of Ca²⁺ sensing receptors (CaR) on parathyroid cells. Plasma PTH concentration ↑ within minutes of a ↓ in serum Ca²⁺ levels.
- 1𝛼-hydroxylase ↑ active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)) activation in kidney.
- ↓ of extracellular Ca²⁺ levels for weeks or months promotes development of parathyroid gland hyperplasia, which is characteristic of hyperparathyroidism.

### Causes

- Hypocalcaemia generally results from another disease.
1. Hypoparathyroidism → Lack of PTH means there is an inability to increase Plasma Calcium
2. Hypomagnesaemia: required to produce PTH and hence when low, there is reduced PTH synthesis and release, reducing Blood Calcium.
3. Renal failure: lack of vitamin D activation, due to lack of 1𝛼- hydroxylase, reducing Calcium absorption in the GI Tract.
4. Pseudohypoparathyroidism: mutation of parathyroid receptor preventing the effect of PTH on the cell to facilitate increased calcium levels.
- Presentations of patients with hypocalcaemia vary widely, from asymptomatic (mainly) to life-threatening situations.
- Hypocalcaemia is usually insidious/slow in onset but when serum Ca²⁺ falls below 1.5 mmol/L (6.0 mg/dL), condition becomes ↑ dangerous

### Signs and Symptoms

- Dr Houston ‘Expected to know these Sx are Characteristic of Hypocalcaemia’ → Trousseau’s Sign and Tetany have come up in OCaPEs before Girlies!!!!
- CATS: convulsions, arrhythmias, tetany, spasms and stridor.
- Muscle cramps and carpopedal spasm: Trousseau’s sign of latent tetany (blood pressure cuff occluding brachial artery causes spasm of hand.)
- Wrist and MCP joints flex, DIP and PIP extend and fingers adduct.

- Numbness and paraesthesia.
- Mood swings and depression.
- Tetany and neuromuscular excitability: Chvostek’s sign (shows existing nerve hyperexcitability.
- When facial nerve is tapped in front of tragus, facial muscles on same side of face will contract momentarily as Hypocalcaemia increases excitability of CN VII.

- Convulsions due to hyperexcitability of motor neurons
- Cardiac arrhythmias: long QT interval.
- Cataracts due to Calcium Phosphate precipitation

# Phosphate Homeostasis

- Many organs involved in phosphate regulation and these include kidney, GI tract, parathyroid glands and bone.
- Phosphate is required for numerous cellular functions such as:
    1. DNA synthesis (phosphate backbone).
    2. Membrane lipid synthesis (phospholipid bilayer).
    3. Generation of high-energy phosphate esters (ATP).
    4. Intracellular signalling (phosphorylating key proteins in chain reaction)
- The balance between the quantity of phosphate absorbed in the GI Tract and excreted by the kidneys is established via the Phosphate pool in the ECF (where Phosphate is biologically active) as an intermediate hold of Phosphate as it is being transferred between different organs
- Most of the phosphate is stored within bones

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 02.02.57.png](%5B024%5D%20Endocrine%20Control%20of%20Calcium%20Homeostasis%20c5bd95fb8c114b7fb41c3876ae271421/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_02.02.57.png)

- Absorption of phosphate is ↑ in presence of 1,25(OH)₂ vitamin D.
- As phosphate levels ↑, PTH is released to promote ↑ renal phosphate excretion to maintain Phosphate Homeostasis.
- Fine regulation of phosphate occurs in proximal tubule of kidney with 80-97% of the phosphate filtered load being reabsorbed through NaPi co-transporters.
- Balance between phosphate absorption from intestine, mobilisation from bone and excretion via kidneys in urine determines final levels of plasma phosphate.
- In kidneys, up to 65-70% of filtered phosphate is reabsorbed via proximal tubules using Na⁺-dependent phosphate transporters.
- Renal tubule NaPi transporters are regulated by vitamin D and PTH.
- Most actions of vitamin D require activation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)₂D₃/calcitriol).

---

# Hyperphosphataemia

- Abnormally ↑ serum phosphate levels can result form ↑ phosphate intake, ↓ phosphate excretion or a disorder that shifts intracellular phosphate into extracellular space.
- Hyperphosphataemia is mostly asymptomatic and is incidentally diagnosed in a blood test for another purpose.
- ↓ Ca²⁺/↑ phosphate levels occur in renal failure, hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism.
- ↑ Ca²⁺/↑ phosphate levels are observed with vitamin D intoxication (Raised Vitamin D).
- ↑ phosphate levels can be treated with phosphate binders to increase phosphate excretion and dietary restriction of phosphate to reduce phosphate intake.
- ↑ PTH results in ↓ vs ↑ serum phosphate levels as whilst there is increase Phosphate uptake across the gut, there is a more significant ↓ renal tubular phosphate reabsorption due to PTH, causing Net Phosphate Loss and hence, producing Hypophosphataemia.

---

# Summary of Ca²⁺ and Phosphate

- When blood Ca²⁺ becomes too low, CaR in parathyroid glands become activated.
- This results in release of PTH, which acts to ↑ blood Ca²⁺ (e.g. by osteoclasts) and ↑ Ca²⁺ reabsorption from urine and GI tract.
- Calcitonin, released from C cells in thyroid gland, works opposite way, ↓ Ca²⁺ levels in blood by causing more Ca²⁺ to be stored in bone.
- PTH ↓ reabsorption of phosphate from proximal tubule of kidney, ↑ phosphate excretion.
- PTH enhances uptake of phosphate from intestine and bones into blood.
- In intestines, absorption of both Ca²⁺ and phosphate is mediated by an ↑ in activated vitamin D, stimulated by PTH
