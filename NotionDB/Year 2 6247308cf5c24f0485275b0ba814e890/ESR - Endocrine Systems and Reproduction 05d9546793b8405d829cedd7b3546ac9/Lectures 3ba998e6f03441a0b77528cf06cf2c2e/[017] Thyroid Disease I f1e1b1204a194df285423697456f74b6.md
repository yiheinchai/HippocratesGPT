Progress: Reviewed

# Hyperthyroidism

- Primary Endocrine Disorder = Disease affecting the Endocrine Organ that produces the Hormone (Usually the Target Hormone)
- Secondary Endocrine Disorder = Disease affecting the Hypothalamus/Pituitary Gland that alters production of the Tropic Hormone by the Endocrine Gland
- Primary hyperthyroidism: thyroid producing too much thyroid hormone.
- T3 and T4 subsequently suppresses TRH and TSH production, shown by ‚Üë levels of T3 and T4, but ‚Üì TSH.

# Grave‚Äôs Disease (Type of Thyrotoxicosis)

- Cause of 50% of thyrotoxicosis.
- Thyrotoxicosis ‚Üí Clinical Sx that arise due to Hyperthyroidism (Regardless of its source)
- Autoimmune disease where autoantibodies are produced against TSH receptor.
- These Bind and activates receptor.
- It is the only well-established example of an antibody which mimics a hormone.

### Clinical Features ‚Üí Thyroid Eye Disease (When It Affects the Eye)

- Periorbital oedema/Blephriatis
- Proptosis: eyes are clearly coming out of eye socket, due to swelling of muscles behind eyes.
- Diplopia: eye-movements not co ordinated.
- Corneal ulceration ‚Üí Eyelids cannot close completely over the eye, exposing part of the cornea so that it is vulnerable to injury
- Loss of visual acuity.
- Pretibial myxoedema ‚Üí Swelling on the anterior surface of the Distal Tibia
- Thyroid acropachy/Clubbing: swelling of tissue underneath nail

### Long Acting Thyroid Stimulator

- Experiment: take a mouse
and label with radioactive iodine.
- Radioactive iodine taken up and produces TH and put into colloid pool.
- TSH will stimulate release of TH, containing radioactive Iodine, from colloid pool.
- Measure this as radioactivity in mouse's blood (red triangle).
- Taking serum from patient with Graves' disease and injecting into mouse, causes
same spike, but shifted/delayed 12 hours along relative to TSH (long acting
thyroid stimulator).
- This delayed Spike occurred due to the presence of a ‚ÄòLong Acting Thyroid Stimulator‚Äô which acts like TSH (but isn‚Äôt TSH as [TSH] is extremely low in Grave‚Äôs Disease), which turned out to be TSH-Ab which stimulated TSH-Rs
- TSHR Abs (TSH-receptor antibodies) are not subject to -ve feedback, unlike TSH, therefore thyroid stimulation persists ‚Üí thyrotoxicosis.

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 19.10.20.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_19.10.20.png)

### TSH-R Abs Do Not Always Stimulate

- There are 2 types of TSH-Rs produced in Grave‚Äôs Disease
1. TSI (thyroid stimulating antibodies): causes thyrotoxicosis as it activates receptor.
2. TBII (TSHR binding inhibitory immunoglobulins): causes hypothyroidism as it binds and blocks/antagonises the receptor.
- Graves‚Äô disease patients often begin by producing TSI, and later on, switch type of antibodies produced to TBII.
- The proportion of TSI and TBII in the blood can vary over the course of the Disease, producing a relapsing and remitting oscillating pattern of disease depending on which type of Ab is in greatest [ ]

---

# Immunology of Grave‚Äôs Disease

- Genetic predisposition (HLA DR17, DQ2).
- However, as Grave‚Äôs Disease is more common than that which can be explained via Inheritance (Some Px with Grave‚Äôs Disease do not have Genetic Predisposition), there must be an environmental trigger
- Causes:
1. T cell infiltration ‚Üí Release IFN-Œ≥, IL-1 and TNF-Œ±, triggering HLA-Ag Complex Presentation.
- This leads to the recruitment of Inflammatory Cells (E.g Macrophages), which release futher Inflammatory Cytokines to recruit B Cells
- B and plasma cell proliferation then occurs, producing Anti TSH-R Abs, which stimulate TH production.

---

# Autoimmune Associations (Polyglandular Autoimmune Syndrome Type II)

- Many patients with thyroid diseases also have other autoimmune manifestations (polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type II).
1. T1DM ‚Üí Autoimmune Vs Œ≤ Cells
2. Addison‚Äôs disease: autoimmune attack of adrenal cortex.
3. Pernicious anaemia ‚Üí Autoimmune vs Parietal Cells 
4. Vitiligo: autoimmune attack of melanocytes.
5. Hypoparathyroidism: autoimmune attack of parathyroid.
6. Hypogonadism ‚Üí Autoimmune Vs Steroid Producing Cells in Gonads
- This can be triggered by Immunotherapy with Anti-PD1 and Anti-CTLA4 mAbs (Checkpoint Inhibitors used to inhibit Growth in Cancer Px)

---

# Thyroid Eye Disease

- TSI binding to extraorbital muscle antigens via crossreaction leads to inflammatory cell infiltrate into Extraocular Muscles, causing secretion of cytokines
- Fibroblasts within Extraocular Muscles secrete glycosaminoglycans (composite molecules of carbohydrate and proteins).
- They are hydrophilic, so causes oedema/swelling of Extraocular Muscles due to water retention, causing fibrosis which paralyses the eye muscles to cause TED.

# Diagnostic Tests for Hyperthyroidism

### Thyroid Autoantibodies

- Anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (TG) are non-specific and insensitive.
- Anti TSHR Abs are specific for Graves‚Äô disease (95%).

### Thyroid Scintigram

- Inject 99mTc-labelled Pertechnate (which is taken up by NIS into Follicular Cells).
- Scan under ùõæ camera to visualise where Radioisotope is taken up.
- [Left] Graves‚Äô disease: even uptake and distribution of isotope (Smooth Uptake). Outlines a normally shaped thyroid gland.
- [Right] Multinodular goitre: uneven distribution amongst gland, with increased uptake of radioisotope into some lumps in comparison to others.
- Faintly labelled regions are not taking up isotope.
- This means that Thyrotoxicosis is not caused by widespread overactivity of the Thyroid due to TRABs (TSH-R Abs) but it is driven by localised overactivity within the Thyroid

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 19.23.01.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_19.23.01.png)

- Toxic nodule/adenoma: all of
tracer is concentrate in a particular lump/nodule.
- The activity of the rest of gland is suppressed as TSH is low, so rest of thyroid gland is inactive.

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 19.24.13.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_19.24.13.png)

- Thyroiditis: thyroid destroyed by
immune system, causing inflammation which damages the thyroid
- This leads to mass release of TH from the Colloid Pools of the Thyroid but damage means that the Thyroid is unable to synthesise new TH
- Subacute/Silent ‚Üí Painless
- De Quervains ‚Üí Painful
- Postpartum ‚Üí After Pregnancy
- It can also be triggered by Contrast Agents
- This is also seen in iodine overload.

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 19.25.03.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_19.25.03.png)

# Medical Treatment of Hyperthyroidism

### Antithyroid Drugs

- E.g Propylthiouracil and Carbimazole ‚Üí Thyroid Peroxidase Inhibitors
- Useful for Graves‚Äô disease (50% remit at  18 months) and Toxic MNG/adenoma will not remit.
- Rash/urticaria/arthralgia (up to 10%).
- Agranulocytosis (0.2%) ‚Üí Low WBC Count.
- Inhibit thyroid peroxidase.

### Lugol‚Äôs Iodine

- Iodine Overload of Thyroid via KI Solution.
- This blocks production of T4/T3 by Wolff Chaikoff effect (injection of iodine inhibits organification and hence, T3/4 Synthesis).
- Effective for 10 days.
- Useful for turning off thyroid in preparation for surgical removal, with a window of 10 days.
- Then becomes hyperthyroid (Jod Basedow effect).

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 19.26.33.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_19.26.33.png)

- NIS symporter is exploited to image thyroid. Graves‚Äô disease (even distribution), toxic adenoma/nodule (uptake into 1 spot)

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 19.28.13.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_19.28.13.png)

### Radioiodine (I-131)

- There is specificity of I‚Åª uptake by thyroid tissue as the thyroid is the only tissue in the body that expresses NIS.
- I-131 decays to produced high energy ùõΩ-particles (plus ùõæ radiation) which induce radiation damage within the Thyroid, leading to Apoptosis of damaged cells.
- This is commonly used where Drugs are unable to correct Hyperthyroidism
- Especially effective for toxic MNG/adenoma as it destroys the hyperactive tissue.
- Also used for Graves‚Äô disease.
- Side effects: Hypothyroidism eventually in 70-80% and worsening of thyroid eye disease.
- Pregnancy: advised not to get pregnant for 6/12 week after.

### Surgery

- Undertaken in cases where patient is unable to take drugs or RAI (radioiodine therapy), or there is a large goitre which can compress trachea and oesophagus.
- Complications:
1. Hypothyroidism: as thyroid gland is removed.
2. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (1%) ‚Üí Vocal Cord Dysfunction.
3. Hypoparathyroidism (often transient, 2% permanent): caused by damage to parathyroid glands ‚Üí Hypocalcaemia.
4. Haemorrhage due to high vascularity of Thyroid (Haemorrhage into Anterior Compartment of the Neck compresses the Trachea and leads to Asphyxiation)
5. Infection

---

# Hypothyroidism

- Primary hypothyroidism due to Hypoactivity of the Thyroid: more common than hyperthyroidism.
- Low Free T4 and T3 but very high TSH (Due to Disinhibition of TSH Secretion due to low levels of T4 and T3 AKA Low Negative Feedback inhibition of TSH by T3/4)
- Estimated to affect 0.5-1.9% of women and <1% of men and increases with age
- Slow Relaxing Reflexes are a common and characteristic sign

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 19.31.58.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_19.31.58.png)

### Signs and Symptoms

| Symptoms | Signs (Examination) |
| --- | --- |
| Tiredness | Pale, Pasty Complexion |
| ‚ÄòSlowed Down‚Äô Dementia ‚Üí Pseudodementia | Disinterested, slow to speak, bradycardia,
slow-relaxing reflexes, confusion, coma. |
| Neck Swelling | Goitre |
| Constipation |  |
| Weight Gain | Obesity |
| Cold Intolerant | Hypothermia (Extreme Cases) |
| Subfertility, Menorrhagia |  |

![21e69822cb73726fed2191c6f708ad8c.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/21e69822cb73726fed2191c6f708ad8c.png)

- Goitre can be caused by both Hyperthyroidism and Hypothyroidism and therefore, cannot be used to Dx either Thyroid Dysfunction

### Causes

1. Autoimmune Primary Hypothyroidism (E.g Hashimoto‚Äôs Thyroiditis) - 2% of population. 10 x more common in women than men ‚Üí Most common cause
2. Iatrogenic - Surgery, RAI, Anti-Thyroid Drugs ‚Üí Reduce Thyroid Function
3. Thyroiditis
4. Iodine Deficiency - In Mountainous Areas like SE Asia, Latin America and Africa ‚Üí Lack of Iodine so unable to synthesise T3/4
5. Congenital
- Thyroid Dyshormogenesis - Defect in TH Syntheiss
- Athyreosis - No Thyroid present (E.g PAX8 Mutation)
- It is important to Dx Congenital Causes as Hypothyroidism in babies can impact Development of Brain
1. Secondary Hypothyroidism -  Pituitary Disease or Surgery

---

# Grave‚Äôs Disease (Hyperthyroidism) Vs Hashimoto‚Äôs Disease (Hypothyroidism)

- Graves‚Äô disease: B cells producing autoantibodies (TRABs) against TSH-R on Thyroid Follicular Cells, often stimulating these to increase TH Production
- Hashimoto‚Äôs disease: Immunoglobulins against TPO and Thyroglobulin in thyroid epithelial cells lead to cell death via Opsonisation or Tc activation, destroying the Thyroid and causing Hypoactivity

---

# Hashimoto‚Äôs Thyroiditis

- Immunofluorescent staining with anti-TPO (antithyroid peroxidase) antibodies staining normal human thyroid section.
- Antibody binds to inside of follicle, lighting up section

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 19.44.42.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_19.44.42.png)

# Congenital Hypothyroidism

- 1:4,000 live births in an iodine replete region.
- Screen for cretinism: severe neurological impairment and learning disability due to lack of TH from an early age due to Congenital Hypothyroidism.
- Causes:
1. Maternal Iodine deficiency: commonest worldwide
2. Dyshormogenesis: genetic defect in component of thyroid hormone synthesis.
3. Athyreosis: no thyroid at all, due to mutation in PAX8.
- As a result, screen blood of all newborns for ‚Üë TSH (via heel prick) and treat with Levo-T4 as soon as possible.
- Px with Congenital Hypothyroidism are often Jaundice

---

# Iodine Insufficiency

- We require a minimum of 50 ùúáùëî of iodide/day.
- Iodine insufficiency is a cause of endemic goitre (Thyroid Hypertrophies in response to Low Iodine in an attempt to increase TH Production back to normal levels), profound cretinism and Short Stature (As TH is important in stimulating Growth alongside TH).
- Main source of iodine: drinking water, seaweed and seafood, Iodised Oil (Depot Adminsitration IM to correct Low Iodine over a sustained period of time),  iodised salt (not found in UK), dairy products (from residual iodine used to clean tanks used to collect milk).
- Supply of iodine is mainly provided in water and depends upon local geology as minerals present in rocks (over which water passes) determines the minerals and ions found in water.
- Certain areas have a lack of iodine in water but most areas have sufficient Iodine in their water to meet physiological needs.
- Problem typically in mountainous central land masses: Italy, Russia, Parts of Africa, North Korea and Vietnam
- Thyroid is able to compensate for Reduced Iodine Intake to some extent:
1. ‚Üë I‚Åª uptake via NIS due to increased NIS expression as a result of Raised TSH
2. ‚Üë I‚Åª recycling in thyroid within MIT and DIT (Reduced Iodide Excretion).
3. MIT preferentially formed over DIT as low Iodide supply means compounds with less iodine are more likely to be formed (so T3:T4 ratio ‚Üë). 
- Therefore, more of TH is present in the active vs Inactive form, maintain Euthyroid/Normal Thyroid Function for some while
- With time, Endemic Goitre forms due to TSH, causing Thyroid Follicular Cell Hyperplasia (This can drive Nodular Growth within the Thyroid)

### Mild-Moderate Iodine Insufficiency in UK

- National survey of UK schoolgirls in 2010 showed median urine iodine content of 80 ùúáùëî/ùêø (should be > 100 ùúáùëî/ùêø, and > 150 ùúáùëî/ùêø in pregnancy) due to reduced iodine consumption.
- This is due to free school milk being withdrawn in 1970s and salt iodisation not being mandatory in UK, causing a lack of dietary iodine.
- The potential impact of this on foetal brain development during pregnancy is unknown.

---

# Dyshormonogenesis

- Genetic defects in enzymes and proteins involved in TH Synthesis such as:
1. NIS
2. Thyroglobulin
3. Pendrin
4. Thyroperoxidase
5. Iodothyrosine deiodinase ‚Üí Allows for Iodide Recycling of Byproducts of TH Production to minimise Iodide Loss
6. Dual oxidase 2
- This leads to Hypothyroidism (Due to Defective TH Synthesis) and Goitre (Due to raised TSH seen in Hypothyroidism)

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 18.05.53.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_18.05.53.png)

---

# Non-Goitrous Congenital Hypothyroidism

- Defect in thyroid embryological development (athyreosis) due to mutations in:
1. PAX8
2. NKX2-5
3. Defect in TSH-R or TSH itself
4. TSHR loss of function mutation
5. TSHB
- This is distinguished from dyshormogenesis as there is no goitre here as Thyroid is not present or non responsive to TSH and hence, cannot undergo compensatory hyperplasia

---

# Secondary Hypothyroidism

- Secondary hypothyroidism: when thyroid is functional but hypothalamus and pituitary is dysfunctional due to Tumour or Damage (E.g Surgery)
- ‚Üì T4/T3, TSH is on the lower end of the Normal Range (but not usually low).
- Despite the low T3 and T4, Dysfunction of the Hypothalamus or Pituitary means that there is no compensatory increase in TSH Production in an attempt to increase TH Levels

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 19.48.46.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_19.48.46.png)

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 19.49.11.png](%5B017%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20I%20f1e1b1204a194df285423697456f74b6/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_19.49.11.png)

### General Treatment of Hypothyroidism

- Levothyroxine (T4): half-life 1 week.
- Liothyronine (T3): half-life 3-6 hours and hence, need to give 3-4 times a day.
- Thyroid extract: from cow/pigs. However, extract has T3 > T4 which is not suitable for humans as humans require T4 > T3.
- General Principle = Treat and titrate TH Levels until normal TSH levels have been established.

---

# Summary

- Hypo- and hyperthyroidism are extremely common.
- Thyroid function tests are first test you do.
- Physiology of HPT axis explains test results you obtain.
- Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism can cause goitre.
