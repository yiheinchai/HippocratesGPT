# [003] CAL - Principles of Endocrine Homeostasis

Progress: Not started

# Cell Signalling

- Neuroendocrine Signalling = Secretion of Hormones from Neurons into the Blood
- Gap Junctions can be used to signal between connected cells via the movement of Intracellular Molecules (E.g Ions) through these junctions into neighbouring cells
- Hormonal Control is slower in onset and offset than Nervous Control
- Hormones that bind to cell surface receptors and signal via activation or inhibition of enzymes take minutes for their effects to be established and minutes for the effects to be lost when the stimulus is removed (E.g Peptide, Protein and Catecholamines).
- Hormones that enter cells and occupy nuclear receptors (Steroid and Thyroid Hormones) activate gene transcription and translation with the production of new proteins.
- This takes minutes to hours and removal of the stimulus does not immediately reverse the cellular changes that require protein synthesis to cease and removal of the new protein. This means that these hormones have slow, sustained effects.

# Endocrine Glands

- Mainly found in the Midline
- These include Hypothalamus, Pituitary Gland, Thyroid Gland, Parathyroid Gland, Adrenal Glands, Pancreas and Gonads

---

# Hormones

- There are 3 broad classes of hormones:
1. Peptides & proteins
2. Amines
3. Steroids
- Most hormones are peptides or proteins. They are secreted by the pituitary, parathyroid, thyroid, heart, stomach, liver, pancreas and kidneys. E.g Calcitonin, Insulin, TSH, Oxytocin and ADH, Prolactin
- **Amines** are derived from the amino acid tyrosine and are secreted from the thyroid and the adrenal medulla. E.g Thyroxine, DA and A
- **Steroids** are lipids derived from cholesterol (E.g Sex Hormones). Steroid hormones are secreted by the gonads, adrenal cortex, and placenta. E.g Oestrogen and Aldosterone

### Amines

- Catecholamines, Thyroid Hormones and Adrenergic Hormones, all derived from Tyrosine
- These hormones do not form a single homogeneous group.
- The catecholamines are synthesized and stored in cell vesicles. These are released by exocytosis when required.
- Thyroid hormones are stored in thyroid follicles as thyroglobulin. When required, the thyroid cells release the hormone from this store and it enters the blood.
- The catecholamines are water soluble. But the thyroid hormones are not and so are carried in the blood bound to a plasma protein – thyroxine binding globulin.
- The catecholamines act through surface receptors but the thyroid hormones are lipid soluble and act through nuclear receptors.

### Peptides and Proteins

- Some protein hormones contain carbohydrate side chains so are glycoproteins (e.g.; thyroid-stimulating  hormone).
- The peptide and protein hormones are all water soluble and act on surface receptors.
- Despite being water soluble, growth hormone (GH) is the exception in that it is bound to a protein in the plasma rather than dissolved in the Plasma.
- Growth hormone–binding protein actually has the same amino acid sequence as the extracellular component of the GH receptor.

### Steroids

- Lipids and hence, Lipid Soluble

### Duration of Action

- Peptide, Protein and Catecholamine Hormones bind to cell surface receptors and are rapid in onset and offset when the Hormone is present and removed
- Steroid and Thyroid Hormones bind to intracellular receptors and are slow in onset and offset when the Hormone is present and removed

---

# Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic

### Hydrophilic Hormones

- Contain numerous polar groups that allows them to be soluble in water
- These are mainly protein/peptide hormones as the Polar Peptide Bonds and often, Polar R-Groups, makes them water soluble
- Water-Solubility of Glycoprotein hormones is increased beyond that of proteins due to the presence of Polar N-Linked and/or O-Linked Carbohydrate Chains
- Catecholamines are Hydrophilic due to the presence of Polar -OH Groups
- Prostaglandins, despite being lipid-derived, are hydrophilic due to the presence of -COOH, which is also found on their precursor, Arachidonic Acid
- Their Hydrophilicity means they cannot diffuse across the Plasma Membrane and hence, signal by binding to Cell Surface Receptors and activating Secondary Messenger/Enzymatic Cascades within the Cell
- This means they must be packaged into vesicles that fuse with the Plasma membrane prior to their secretion
- Plasma [ ] can be controlled at the level of Synthesis and Secretion

### Hydrophobic Hormones

- Often have a Cyclical Carbon ring and are derived from Cholesterol (Steroid Hormones), Tyrosine (Thyroid Hormones) or Derivatives of Fat Soluble Vitamins A&D
- They can freely diffuse across the Plasma Membrane of Endocrine Glands and bind to Intracellular Receptors
- When unbound, Intracellular Receptors are found in the cytoplasm or nucleus (not on intracellular organelles) and upon Ligand Binding, they translocate into the Nucleus, where they Dimerise to bind to DNA
- Here, they act as Ligand-Dependent Transcription Factors to alter transcriptional activity
- Plasma [ ] can only be controlled at the level of synthesis as their secretion into the blood is not regulated (Plasma [ ] is directly proportional to Synthesis rate)

---

# Hypothalamo-Pituitary Axis Feedback

- Depending on the Hormone, there can be variable input from the Higher Brain Centres both stimulating and inhibiting Hypothalamic Secretion of Hormones
- Hypothalamic Nuclei secrete hormones into the Median Eminence, from which they diffuse into the capillaries and are carried into the Anterior Pituitary in the Portal Circulation
- Releasing Hormones stimulate specific cells that secrete trophic hormones that diffuse into the Portal Capillaries and are carried into the Venous Blood leaving the Pituitary
- These Trophic Hormones act on their specific target cell in the Endocrine Glands that secrete hormones that alter the functions of their targets through the body

![Screenshot 2022-01-24 at 00.59.50.png](%5B003%5D%20CAL%20-%20Principles%20of%20Endocrine%20Homeostasis%20be3ccf91070f4fc0bbb641d466c51726/Screenshot_2022-01-24_at_00.59.50.png)

- These processes are under feedback control.
1. Increased trophic hormone feeds back to inhibit the hypothalamic secretion of releasing hormone.
2. Increasing peripheral concentrations of gland hormone feedback to inhibit release of trophic hormone by the anterior pituitary cells and secretion of releasing hormone by the hypothalamus.

# Endocrine Axis

- **A key-feature of endocrine homeostatic loops is that they involve negative feedback.**
- In the simplest endocrine axes, a hormone, X, controls and responds to the concentrations of a metabolite, Y (where Y may be another hormone, a nutrient or ion).
- Hence, If the concentration of the solute **Y** departs from the normal physiological concentration for that solute, a homeostatic chain of events will be initiated whereby the concentration of the hormone **X** will alter in such a way as to return the concentration of solute **Y** to within the normal range.
- This is seen with Raised Glucose and Insulin, Raised Potassium and Aldosterone and Raised Calcitriol and Calcium
- In these simple loops. Homeostatic Relationship can fail due to:
1. Defect in Synthesis of X or Y (E.g Mutation)
2. Defect in Secretion of X or Y (Protein trapped in Golgi or defective signalling pathway)
3. Defect in Action of X or Y (Mutation to receptor or Binding Protein)
4. Defect in ability of Gland that synthesises X to respond to Y or Vice Versa

# Hypothalamo-Pituitary Thyroid Axis (HPT Axis) - LATER

### Thyroid Gland Control

- The hypothalamus receives information about body temperature.
- It adjusts metabolic rate appropriately through its control of thyroid hormone secretion.
- TRH (thyroid releasing hormone) is synthesized by neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and secreted from their nerve endings in the median eminence when plasma thyroxine levels are low.
- TRH reaches the TSH–secreting basophilic cells in the anterior pituitary through the portal circulation. Here it binds to G protein–coupled receptors, that acting through IP₃ and diacylglycerol, elevate cell Ca²⁺ concentration which triggers the exocytotic release of TSH.
- The released TSH feeds back to inhibit further TRH release.
- It also stimulates the thyroid gland to release thyroxine.
- In turn, the elevated thyroxine levels inhibit further TSH and TRH release.

![Screenshot 2022-01-24 at 01.11.59.png](%5B003%5D%20CAL%20-%20Principles%20of%20Endocrine%20Homeostasis%20be3ccf91070f4fc0bbb641d466c51726/Screenshot_2022-01-24_at_01.11.59.png)

---

# Hypothalamo-Pituitary Adrenal Axis (HPA) - LATER

- The hypothalamus receives information about the levels of stress and adjusts the levels of cortisol appropriately through control of its secretion.
- CRH (corticotropin releasing hormone) is synthesized by neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and secreted from their nerve endings in the median eminence in response to stress.
- CRH reaches the ACTH–secreting basophilic cells in the anterior pituitary through the portal circulation. Here CRH binds to G protein–coupled receptors, that acting through adenylyl cyclase, stimulate the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signal transduction pathway.
- The released ACTH feeds back to inhibit further CRH release.
- ACTH also stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol. In turn, the elevated cortisol levels inhibit further ACTH and CRH release.
- Note that vasopressin is also synthesized by cells in the paraventricular nucleus. Some of these nerve endings also release vasopressin into the median eminence from which it moves to the anterior pituitary. Though not, itself, a significant stimulator of ACTH secretion, it augments the effects of CRH so that there is greater ACTH release.
- The major release of vasopressin, however, is from the nerve endings in the posterior pituitary.
- Note also that ACTH is cleaved from a much larger molecule – pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) – that also yields β-endorphin and α-MSH (secreted from the intermediate lobe of the pituitary and that regulates the production of melanin). Over expression of these POMC cleavage products can cause skin colour changes associated with pathology of the HPA.

# Hypothalamo-Pituitary Gonadal Axes (HPG) - LATER

### Males

- The hypothalamus receives information related to sexual activity.
- It modulates this appropriately through its control of testosterone secretion.
- GnRH (gonadotropin–releasing hormone) is synthesized by neurons in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus and secreted from their nerve endings in the median eminence when plasma testosterone levels are low.
- It reaches the FSH–secreting and LH–secreting basophilic cells in the anterior pituitary through the portal circulation. Here it binds to G protein–coupled receptors in the phosphoinositide system, elevating cell Ca²⁺ concentration that triggers the exocytotic release of FSH and LH.
- In males, there is pulsatile release of GnRH at a constant frequency. This results in pulsatile release of FSH and LH.
- The released FSH and LH feed back to the hypothalamus to inhibit further release.
- FSH stimulates spermatogenesis while LH stimulates the testicular interstitial cells to produce testosterone. There is very little oestrogen production.
- The elevated testosterone levels also inhibit further FSH, LH, and GnRH release.

### Females

- The pattern in the **female** is similar to that in the male but differs in some significant ways.
- The hypothalamus receives information related to sexual activity and modulates this appropriately through its control of oestrogen and progesterone secretions.
- GnRH (gonadotropin–releasing hormone) is synthesised by neurons in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus and secreted from their nerve endings in the median eminence when plasma LH levels are low.
- GnRH reaches the FSH–secreting and LH–secreting basophilic cells in the anterior pituitary through the portal circulation.
- Here GnRH binds to G protein–coupled receptors in the phosphoinositide system, elevating cell Ca²⁺ concentration that triggers the exocytotic release of FSH and LH.
- In females, there is pulsatile release of GnRH at frequencies that differ through the menstrual cycle. This results in variable pulsatile release of FSH and LH.
- Low- amplitude, high frequency pulses, seen early in the menstrual cycle, favour FSH release.
- High-amplitude, low-frequency pulses seen later in the menstrual cycle favour LH release.
- During the first part of the menstrual cycle, oestrogen provides negative feedback to the FSH–producing cells in the anterior pituitary, so FSH levels remain low. Oestrogen also inhibits LH release.
- Shortly before ovulation, however, higher oestrogen levels stimulate LH release and this is what causes ovulation.

### Post-Ovulation

- Once ovulation occurs, oestrogen levels fall and progesterone levels rise. Progesterone inhibits further release of GnRH, LH, and FSH.
- The positive oestrogen–LH loop is now inhibited.
- If pregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum continues to produce progesterone and the secretion of GnRH continues to be suppressed.
- In the fourth month, the placenta takes over progesterone production.
- If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels fall, the hypothalamus secretes GnRH and the cycle begins again.
- The menstrual cycle of repetitive progression of Oocyte maturation and release accompanied by uterine development runs over approximately 28 days

# Dual Control Feedback Systems

- Commonly, two (or more) hormones (insulin and glucagon) must act antagonistically to control the concentration of a given solute or ion, i.e. glucose.
- This allows for both increases and decreases in the levels of a molecule to be tightly regulated

![Screenshot 2022-01-24 at 01.20.46.png](%5B003%5D%20CAL%20-%20Principles%20of%20Endocrine%20Homeostasis%20be3ccf91070f4fc0bbb641d466c51726/Screenshot_2022-01-24_at_01.20.46.png)

### Homeostatic Balance

- The homeostatic relationship between hormones (insulin or glucagon) and a solute/ion (glucose) can fail, leading to an endocrine disorder. Such disorders can reflect:
1. defects in the synthesis of the appropriate hormone
2. defects in hormone secretion
3. defects in the cellular response(s) to the hormone
4. defects in the response of the endocrine gland to the appropriate solute/ion.

# Growth Hormone Control - LATER

- The hypothalamus receives information about body metabolism. This includes information related to puberty which is a time of increased growth hormone secretion.
- The hypothalamus controls growth through its regulation of growth hormone secretion by the anterior pituitary.
- GHRH (growth hormone–releasing hormone) is synthesized by neurons in the arcuate nucleus and secreted from their nerve endings in the median eminence in a pulsatile manner.
- It reaches the growth hormone–secreting acidophilic cells in the anterior pituitary through the portal circulation.
- Here it binds to growth-hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRHR), a G-protein-coupled receptor that activates a Gs protein which results in growth hormone secretion via the adenylyl cyclase – cAMP pathway.
- Growth hormone secretion is also pulsatile.
- Growth hormone stimulates the liver to release insulin-like growth factor (IGF–1).

![Screenshot 2022-01-24 at 01.25.22.png](%5B003%5D%20CAL%20-%20Principles%20of%20Endocrine%20Homeostasis%20be3ccf91070f4fc0bbb641d466c51726/Screenshot_2022-01-24_at_01.25.22.png)

### Inhibition of Growth Hormone

- Growth hormone and IGF-1 inhibit further growth hormone secretion acting both on the anterior pituitary and the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus.
- Growth hormone release is also inhibited by somatostatin secreted by the hypothalamic periventricular nucleus. This counteracts the stimulatory effect of GHRH on the anterior pituitary growth hormone secreting cells.
- As well as inhibiting the release of GHRH from the hypothalamus, growth hormone also stimulates hypothalamic release of somatostatin, which further inhibits growth hormone secretion.
- In the presence of both GHRH and somatostatin the anterior pituitary synthesises and stores GH in secretory granules really for the next pulse of growth hormone secretion.
- Higher brain centres allow inputs such as stress to override normal physiological regulation of growth and can reduce growth potential.

---

# Effects of Growth Hormone - LATER

- Growth hormone has a general stimulatory effect on growth. This includes stimulation of cartilage growth and new bone formation.
- A major effect is increased liver secretion of insulin–like growth factors (IGF–1 and –2) that increases growth in many tissues.
- Although it is water soluble, some 50% is carried in the plasma bound to a protein identical in structure to the extracellular portion of the hormone's peripheral receptor.
- Growth hormone release is stimulated by ghrelin which is involved in the control of food intake, and by androgens and oestrogen where its release in adolescence is linked to sexual maturation.
- Growth hormone release is inhibited by somatostatin and also by glucocorticoids.
- There is a diurnal pattern to its secretion with peaks during sleep.
- Growth hormone is an important metabolic hormone, which stimulates net protein anabolism, lipolysis, and linear bone growth.
- Pulses of GH secretion arise from interactions of hypothalamic GH‐releasing hormone and somatostatin at the somatotroph cell in the anterior pituitary gland.
- The frequency and amplitude of GH pulses are regulated by multiple factors including age, geneder, pubertal status, menstrual cycle phase, body composition, sleep, nutrition, and exercise.
- In diseases such as obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, Turner's syndrome, liver failure, acromegaly, and dwarfism the pulsatile secretion of GH and/or its metabolic clearance rate are altered.

### Metabolic Effects

- In the **liver**:
1. Glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis are stimulated
2. Cell liver glucose concentration rises
3. Glucose is secreted into the blood, raising plasma glucose concentration.

In **adipose tissue**:

1. Fatty acids and glycerol are liberated from triglycerides (lipolysis), and are released into the blood.
2. This allows tissues to shift from glucose to other energy sources.

In **skeletal muscle**:

1. Glycogenolysis is stimulated.
2. The increased provision of fatty acids from lipolysis in adipocytes, provides additional fuel for muscle metabolism.

# Complex Axes

- Many endocrine axes are driven by the hypothalamo-pituitary complex.
- In such axes, a releasing hormone (“A”) synthesised in the hypothalamus acts in the anterior pituitary to stimulate secretion of a trophic hormone (“B”) that, in turn, stimulates the synthesis and/or secretion of the active hormone (“C”).
- In addition to exerting an effect on some physiological/metabolic process, hormone “C” also exerts negative feedback at the level of both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland to control further endocrine drive from “A” and/or “B”.
- Endocrine axes are usually more complex than those depicted previously.
- Typically, an initial hormone “A” stimulates the synthesis and/or secretion of a second hormone “B” which then stimulates production of a third hormone “C” that eventually exerts a homeostatic action on the concentrations of a solute or ion “S”.
- Within the endocrine axis, “C” exerts negative feedback on the production of the stimulatory hormones “A” and/or “B” (with the possibility of further negative feedback from B on A) see below.

# Prolactin Control - LATER

- Prolactin secretion is normally inhibited by dopamine released into the median eminence from hypothalamic arcuate nucleus neurons.
- This is an example of the hypothalamus inhibiting rather than stimulating secretion of an anterior pituitary hormone.
- Physiological stimulators of prolactin secretion released from the hypothalamus are known, such as TSH, but is not the main mechanism used.
- The most potent stimulator of prolactin release is stimulation of the nipple by suckling.
- This information is carried to the hypothalamus via afferent nerves from the nipples and inhibits dopamine release from arcuate nucleus neurons.
- Mammary gland development during pregnancy is facilitated by oestrogen and progesterone but high levels of these hormones inhibit prolactin stimulation of milk production. Thus the mammal tissue is primed but lactation is not initiated.
- Following birth, progesterone levels fall rapidly and this allows prolactin to stimulate milk production and lactation begins.
- Stimulation of the nipples causes oxytocin release as well as increased prolactin availability.
- Oxytocin, from the posterior pituitary, causes contraction of the myoepithelial cells in the mammary gland that help expel the milk from the lactiferous ducts.
- The control of prolactin is unusual but as prolactin is only used in defined function i.e. lactation its activity is normally surpassed and only allowed to act for defined period in our life cycle.
- Note positive feedback loops as we see in the induction of oxytocin and also not the norm and are tightly regulated so that they do not over amplify the signals involved.
- The primary event is suckling and when this ceases so does the positive feedback loop.

![Screenshot 2022-01-24 at 01.34.56.png](%5B003%5D%20CAL%20-%20Principles%20of%20Endocrine%20Homeostasis%20be3ccf91070f4fc0bbb641d466c51726/Screenshot_2022-01-24_at_01.34.56.png)

# Positive Feedback Loops

- In endocrine axes, the rule is negative feedback, and defects in this negative feedback leads to an endocrine disorder.
- The exceptions to this general rule are provided by those endocrine axes which rely on positive feedback. In such cases, a hormone (X) exerts a positive action on a physiological process (Y) and that process exerts positive feedback on the production of hormone “X”in a vicious endocrine spiral.
- Hence, if the concentration of the solute “X” departs from the normal physiological concentration for that solute, a homeostatic chain of events will be initiated whereby the concentration of the hormone “X” will increase “Y”. Until the initial stimulus is removed and “X” returns to normal, then so will “Y”.
- This is seen in:
1. Oxytocin in the Fergusson Reflex to expel the Foetus
2. Oxytocin secretion to stimulate contraction of milk glands in the Sucking Reflex (Milk Let Down Reflex)

![Screenshot 2022-01-24 at 01.33.49.png](%5B003%5D%20CAL%20-%20Principles%20of%20Endocrine%20Homeostasis%20be3ccf91070f4fc0bbb641d466c51726/Screenshot_2022-01-24_at_01.33.49.png)

# Oxytocin and Positive Feedback Loops - LATER

- At parturition, oxytocin (in concert with prostaglandins) stimulates the contraction of the myometrium to expel the infant from the uterus.
- Passage of the infant across the cervix leads to distension of the vaginal walls, which, in turn, triggers further secretion of oxytocin in the Fergusson reflex.
- The more oxytocin that stimulates the myometrium to contract, the greater the stretch on the vaginal walls, leading to even greater production of oxytocin.
- In this example, a positive feedback loop is a normal physiological mechanism required for the expulsion of an infant with minimal delay and risk of foetal distress.
- In the months following birth, the auditory input from a crying infant will also trigger secretion of oxytocin, which then stimulates contraction of the lobulo-alveolar ducts of the breast, causing ejection of milk from the nipple.
- In the suckling reflex, the neural reflex input caused by suckling stimulates further secretion of oxytocin, which causes further milk ejection, which stimulates further suckling, etc.
- Once again, a positive feedback loop is a normal and necessary physiological pathway.

---

# Factors Influencing Hormone Concentration

- The free concentration of an active hydrophilic hormone, such as IGF-I, reflects the balance between:
1. synthesis
2. secretion
3. interaction with binding proteins (e.g. IGFBPs) → Increased Binding reduced [Hydrophilic Hormone]
4. metabolism
5. clearance.
- Rate of Secretion is not significant for Steroid/Hydrophobic Hormones like Progesterone as their lipid solubility means they freely diffuse across the Plasma Membrane so that their secretion cannot be regulated (Secretion Rate is determined by Rate of Synthesis)
- The exception to this rule is Thyroid Hormones as they are stored on a peptide backbone to allow for long-term storage of the hormone so that its rate of secretion is not directly proportional to its rate of synthesis
- Hepatic Metabolism of a Hormone is more important for the Clearance of Hydrophobic vs Hydrophilic Hormones
