# [052] Control of Metabolism Tutorial

Progress: Not started

# Case 1

### Presenting Case

- 16 year old
- Stuporous State, Semi Coherent
- Appears Dehydrated
- BP = 85/53 mmHg → Due to Decreased ECV
- HR = 130 bpm
- Deeply breathing (30/min)
- Sweet smelling of breath

### Ix

- 30 mmol/L - Glucose
- Tm of Renal Glucose Uptake → 10 mmol/L

### Blood Gas

- pH = 7.1 (Low)
- HCO3- = 5 mmol/L (Low)
- pCO2 = 16.7 mmol/L (Low)

### Rx

- Fluid IV and Insulin
- Insulin can cause Hypokalaemia and Hypoglycaemia

---

# Insulin

- Low C-Peptide but raised Insulin → Exogenous Insulin Overdose
- C-Peptide is commonly Dx via Urine Analysis
- Beta 2 Agonists (E.g Salbutamol) can stimulate Insulin Release to acutely Rx Hyperkalaemia

---

# Insulinoma

- Can be found in the Elderly → Causes Insulin Oversecretion
