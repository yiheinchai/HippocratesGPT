# Case 1 - HPT Axis

- If a Px has Hypothyroidism, whilst T4 may be lowered, T3 may initially be normal as the Thyroid will compensate by making more T3 in order to maintain Normal Thyroid Signalling
- When measuring Endocrine Hormone Levels in the Blood, it is more useful to measure Free Hormone [ ] than Total [ ] as only the Free Hormone is biologically active
- Low TSH → Due to Primary Hyperthyroidism or Pituitary TSH Deficiency (Secondary Hypothyroidism) but Primary Hyperthyroidism is more common AKA DDx can include Primary Syndrome (due to negative feedback) or Secondary Syndrome (due to direct deficiency)
- Euthyroid = Normal Thyroid Activity (Normal TSH, T3 and T4)
- For Hypothyroidism, T4 is given instead of T3 as T4 is converted into T3 specifically in the Thyroid (allows for better localisation of T3 to the Thyroid to prevent Side Effects from Widespread T3 Activity) and T4 lasts longer in the blood than T3
- [Thyroid Hormones] change slowly as within the Colloid, Large quantities of TH are bound to Thyroglobulin, which allows for slow TH Release and hence, produces slow changes in [TH] upon Rx of Hypothyroidism
- If a Px is supplemented with Levothyroxine and presents with Raised TSH, T3 and T4, Px may have:
1. Secondary Hyperthyroidism due to TSHoma (Unlikely, very rare)
2. Px stopped taking Levothyroxine for a while, Restarted just before appointment (Levothyroxine in System caused T4 and hence, T3 levels to rise/normalise rapidly) but TSH has not yet normalised (from being raised in Hypothyroidism) as [TSH] takes a long time to normalise via Negative Feedback (More Likely)
- Hence, the degree at which TSH is raised in a Px being Rx for Hypothyroidism gives a measure of Compliancy to Medication
- Hence, Immunoassay data provides information about Dx and Compliance
- If Immunoassay cannot be conducted to analyse FT3 and FT4, you can just measure [TSH] in the Blood as it is a reliable indicator of Thyroid Status/Activity (Especially when Hypo/Hyperthyroidism has been previously Dx)

# Case 2

- Raised T4, T3 and **Raised** TSH = Secondary Hyperthyroidism (E.g TSHoma → Very Rare)
- Often get a 2nd blood test if T4, T3 and TSH are raised to confirm if TSH Value is correct
- Methimazole is a Precursor of Carbimazole
