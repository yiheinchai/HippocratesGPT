# [026] The Adrenal Axis

Progress: Reviewed

# Hypthalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis

- Summary: start in hypothalamus with
corticotrophin releasing hormone
(CRH) released from neurones in
paraventricular nucleus in hypothalamus.
- Release contents into median eminence flowing down through hypophyseal portal vessels, to anterior pituitary.
- Will act on corticotroph cells within anterior pituitary to produce adrenal corticotropic hormones (ACTH).
- This is a by-product of larger pre-cursor
hormone (POMC (proopiomelanocortin)). ACTH released from anterior pituitary has a role in inducing long-term stress hormone,
cortisol, from adrenal cortex.
- Also produces small amounts of sulphated DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone).
- Main -ve feedback is through cortisol and DHEA released into circulation (on production of ACTH and production and release of CRH).
- In long-term stress (often due to environmental/circumstantial changes), higher brain centres stimulate ‚Üë levels of cortisol by increasing CRH Release.

---

# Circadian Cortisol Rhythm

- Peak of cortisol in morning, usually around the time we wake up, then falls to baseline levels during night.
- High levels of stress cause elevated cortisol with a less pronounced peak (still occurs at the time of normal rising)
- No fall in Cortisol before sleeping. Disturbs sleep.

# POMC Processing

- Expression of Pre-POMC is driven (usually) by CRH.
- Cleave signal peptide to generate POMC.
- Cleave POMC (by PHC/ endopeptidase): break POMC into proACTH and ùõΩ-LPH.
- Further PHC/ endopeptidase action of ProACTH or ùõΩ-LPH produces additional hormones:
    1. ACTH
    2. MSH: ùõº, ùõΩ, ùõæ (melanocyte stimulating hormone).
    3. ùõΩ-endorphins: ‚Äòfeel-good‚Äô hormones.

---

# Adrenal Organisation

- Small (few cm long) triagular shaped organ that sits on the apex of the Kidney
- Capsule: protection and adhesion to the kidney.
- It is comprised of a superficial adrenal cortex and a deep adrenal medulla
1. Zona Glomerulosa: produces mineralocorticoids (e.g. aldosterone), 21C.
2. Zona Fasciculata: produces glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol), 21C ‚Üí Largest layer of the Cortex which forms the main output of the Cortex
3. Zona Reticularis: produces adrenal androgens (e.g. DHEA), 19C.
- DHEA is important in production of steroids for female reproductive development, but not so in men due to
testosterone production in testes.
- Medulla: produces catecholamines.

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 09.35.08.png](%5B026%5D%20The%20Adrenal%20Axis%20c770006ef161479abf52b7ebbb34ae65/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_09.35.08.png)

- Red section is zona glomerulosa.
- Blue section is zone fasciculata.
Results in production of cortisol.
- Black section is zona reticularis.
Produces adrenal androgens.
- Rate limiting step of Cortical steroid hormone synthesis is cytochrome side-chain (CSCC) cleavage (expressed on inner surface of mitochondrial membranes as a P450 Enzyme and uses shuttle proteins to transport it out of the mitochondria).
- Cholesterol -Cytochome Side-Chain Cleavage‚Üí Pregnenolone -3ùú∑-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase‚Üí Progesterone -P450-21 Hydroxylase‚Üí Deoxycorticosterone -11ùú∑ Hydroxylase‚Üí Corticosterone -11 ùú∑ Hydroxylase‚Üí Aldosterone
- Names of enzymes come from the number of carbons in the side chain on Cholesterol that is being modified
- In the Zona Fasciculata, Cholesterol ‚Üí Pregnenoline by Cytochrome Side Chain Cleavage which is then converted into 17-Œ±-Hydroxypregnenolone by 17 Hydroxylase
- In the Zona Fasiculata, 17Œ±-Hydroxyprogesterone can be formed from Progesterone via 17 Hydroxylase or from 17Œ±-Hydroxypregenolone by 3ùú∑-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase
- Uniquely within the Zona Fasciculata, 17Œ±-Hydroxyprogesterone can be converted to 11-Deoxycortisol by 21 Hydroxylase
- Within both the Zona Glomerulosa and Fasciculata, the enzymes involved in the synthesis of Aldosterone and Cortisol are Cytochrome Side Chain Cleavage, 3ùú∑-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase, 11ùú∑ Hydroxylase and then 11ùú∑ Hydroxylase, act on different substrates to eventually produce different end products
- DHEA is a key steroid, responsible for most sexual maturation phenotypic activity in women (little activity in men).
- In the Zona Reticularis, Cholesterol ‚Üí Pregnenolone ‚Üí 17Œ±-Hydroxypregnenolone ‚Üí DHEA (Dehydroepiandosterone), catalysed by Cytochrome Side Chain Cleavage, 17 Hydroxylase and then 17 Hydroxylase

- The zones of the Adrenal Cortex are defined by the hormones they release rather than histological differences
- Arterial Supply is found superficially, just deep to the Capsule, and sends Cortical and Medullary Capillaries that form highly branched capillary beds in the Cortex or Medulla, draining into a Deep Central Vein
- These capillary beds are responsible for the transport of adrenal hormones from the Cortex into the Blood Stream
- Flow of adrenal gland is important for its function.
- Without flow from cortex into medulla, there would be no adrenaline production.
- Medulla can only release adrenaline depending on cortex.

# Metabolic Actions of Cortisol

- ‚Üë plasma glucose:
    1. Inhibit insulin mediated glucose disposal via GLUT4.
    2. Spare glucose metabolism for tissues that are heavily dependent on Glycolysis (Brain, Adrenal Cortex and RBCs), causing hyperglycaemia.
    3. ‚Üë hepatic gluconeogenesis (release ‚Üë glucose).
    4. ‚Üë availability of gluconeogenic substrates.
- Glycerol (‚Üë lipolysis)
- Free amino-acids (protein catabolism) (for gluconeogenesis or for fuel).

---

# Sparing Glucose Metabolism

- Some tissues (brain, erythrocytes, renal medulla) entirely reliant on glycolysis.
- Most tissues capable of using non-carbohydrates to derive reduced NADH/ FADH2 production for ATP synthesis.
- NEFA ùõΩ-oxidation: acetyl CoA (TCA).
- Amino acids: 6 routes into TCA.

---

# Hepatic Gluconeogenesis

- Must overcome irreversible steps in glycolysis (must overcome these enzymes):
    1. Glucose to glucose-6-phosphate: hexokinase/glucokinase.
    2. Fructose-1-P to fructose-1,6-P2: phosphofructokinase
    3. Phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate.
- Cortisol activates glucocortical receptors to ‚Üë expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes (reverse above irreversible steps in glycolysis):
    1. Glucose-6-P to glucose: glucose-6 phosphatase ‚Üí One of the main enzymes absent in tissues that prevents them from carrying out Gluconeogenesis.
    2. Fructose-1,6-P2 to fructose-1-P: fructose-1,6- bisphosphatase.
    3. Oxaloacetate (OAA) to phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP): PEPCK (PEP carboxykinase).
- These enzymes are antagonistically expressed so that Gluconeogenic Enzymes are not expressed simultaneously to Glycoglytic Enzymes to prevent Futile Cycling of Pyruvate, which would waste reduced coenzymes and energy without generating ATP

---

# Gluconeogenic Substrates

- Cortisol must ‚Üë substrate provision to meet increased rate of Gluconeogenesis:
    1. ‚Üë expression of HSL (hormone sensitive lipase): ‚Üë generation of glycerol from TAG for gluconeogenesis. 
    - NEFA cannot be used for gluconeogenesis.
    1. ‚Üë expression of endopeptidases: ‚Üë hydrolysis of proteins to liberate 6 gluconeogenic amino-acids.

---

# Metabolic Co-Operation

- Cortisol not only hyperglycaemic hormone. Others act via the AC-cAMP-PKA-CREB pathway (catecholamines, glucagon) which Cortisol acts via Cytoplasmic Nuclear Receptors as it is a Steroid Hormone.
- Cortisol exerts permissive genomic actions: Activated GR (bound to GREs) synergises with activated CREB (bound to CREs that bind to CREB from Gs pathway) found in gene sequences encoding relevant metabolic enzymes.

---

# Plasma Solubility of Cortisol

- Interaction with hydrophilic, globular proteins. Cortisol itself is hydrophobic.
- Steroid-binding globulins:
    1. CBG (cortisol binding globulin/transcortin): binds C21 steroids (e.g. aldosterone, cortisol).
    2. SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin): can bind C19 and C18 steroids (e.g. DHEA and other factors).

---

# Non-Metabolic Actions of Cortisol

- -ve feedback (CRH+ ACTH): inhibit CRH and ACTH release from pituitary.
- +ve inotropic action on heart and produce abnormal ECG.
- ‚Üë renal blood flow/GFR/water clearance.
- Inhibits fibroblast proliferation/collagen  formation (‚Üë bruising/impaired wound healing due to reduced fibroblast action in healing, muscle breakdown and reduced protection of blood vessels by Fibroblasts).
- Actions on mood and behaviour: ùõΩ endorphins are produced.
- ‚Üë synthesis of surfactant to allow for the lungs to be inflated more easily (hence, cortisol can be given to babies with Neonatal RDS to stimulate surfactant production where lack of lung maturation reduces surfactant production).
- Anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressant in chronic conditions.
- ‚Üë serum Ca¬≤‚Å∫ (bone catabolism).

---

# Adrenal Dysfunction - Altered Hormone Synthesis

- Cushing‚Äôs disease (Secondary Endocrine Disorder): disease of excess ACTH production from pituitary tumour leading to excess cortisol production and phenotypic appearances.
- Cushing‚Äôs syndrome (Primary Endocrine Disorder): caused by adrenal tumour overproducing cortisol (not from excess ACTH but can come from ectopic sources like small lung cell carcinomas).
- Addison‚Äôs disease: low levels of adrenal hormone (cortisol and aldosterone) ‚Üí Weakness, Hypovolaemia, Increased Skin Pigmentation.
- Adrenal insufficiency: loss of all adrenal hormones, losing actions of aldosterone, cortisol, DHEA and catecholamines.
- Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): Adrenal Hyperplasia due to enzymes mutations in steroidogenic pathway in adrenal cortex.
    - Depending on enzyme mutation, this influences which hormones an individual can be produced (Hormone Profile is used to Dx mutated enzyme clinically).
- Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn‚Äôs syndrome): excess aldosterone production from adrenal gland.
- In Addison‚Äôs Disease, there can be loss of adrenal structure, causing Adrenal Glands to shrink
- Cushing‚Äôs Syndrome, caused by Adrenal Tumours, can cause the Adrenal Glands to enlarge

# CAH

- 2 adrenal glands are located immediately anterior to kidneys, encased in a connective tissue capsule and usually partially buried in fat.
- Like kidneys, adrenal glands lie beneath peritoneum (i.e. they are retroperitoneal).
- Adrenal glands in CAH become larger than kidneys and can cause abdominal swelling and compression of the kidneys (Lower Back Pain).

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 09.45.52.png](%5B026%5D%20The%20Adrenal%20Axis%20c770006ef161479abf52b7ebbb34ae65/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_09.45.52.png)

---

# Adrenal Dysfunction - Altered Hormone Actions

- Pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA): very high levels of aldosterone due to cell insensitivity of aldosterone (can‚Äôt respond because mutation to receptor rendering it insensitive).
- Glucocorticoid resistance: high circulating levels of Glucocorticoids, but receptor is dysfunctional leading to deficit of function.
- Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME): aldosterone levels are
lower than normal but presents with Sx like Hyperaldosteronism.
- ‚Üë cortisol (glucocorticoids) bind to glucocorticoid receptors as well as mineralocorticoid receptor (excess cortisol binding to wrong receptor).

---

# Pathogeneiss

- ‚Üë/‚Üì endocrine drive/production of cortical hormones.
- This can arise due to:
1. Aberrant expression and/or activities of steroidogenic enzyme(s) involved in Aldosterone, Steroid and DHEA Synthesis.
2. Destruction of 1 or more adrenal cortex zones (e.g. autoimmunity causing Addison‚Äôs Disease).
3. Defective steroid receptors (e.g. specificity, binding, Transcription Activating Factor activity).
4. Iatrogenic syndromes due to the use of Glucocorticoids as a therapeutic (notably as an immunosuppressant)

---

# Symptoms of Increased Corticosteroid/Cortisol Action

### 1. Hyperglycaemia ‚Üí Due to Insulin Antagonistic Effects

- ‚Üë gluconeogenesis (liver).
- ‚Üë glycogenolysis (liver + muscle).
- ‚Üë protein catabolism (muscle).
- Insulin resistance (frank NIDDM ‚Üí T2DM symptoms).
- If this hyperglycaemia is sustained (E.g Chronic Stress), it can lead to the development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

### 2. Redistribution of Body Fat

- ‚Üë lipolysis in extremities (HSL) (thin arms and legs).
- ‚Üë central lipogenesis.
- Moon face + buffalo hump + abdominal adiposity.
- Moon Face = Round and Red Face
- Plethoric Face/Hirsutism ‚Üí Increased Facial hair due to raised Adrenal Androgens, leading to increased masculinisation
- Buffalo‚Äôs Hump = Supraclavicular Fat Pads between the Scapulae
- Reduced Cell Membrane integrity within Abdominal Skin means that Central Obesity leads to the formation of Saggital Striae (Red Lines/Strips ‚Üí Similar to Stretch Marks)

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 09.47.57.png](%5B026%5D%20The%20Adrenal%20Axis%20c770006ef161479abf52b7ebbb34ae65/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_09.47.57.png)

1. ‚Üë bruising (weakened vessel walls due to Fibroblast dysfunction and Muscle Breakdown).
2. Immune suppression:
    - Anti-inflammatory action, mainly via Prostaglandin Inhibition (notably PLA2).
    - Lymphatic/thymus involution.
    - Antagonise cytokine action ‚Üí Common Therapeutic Action.
    - Gastric ulceratiton (Prostaglandins protect the Gastric Mucosa from Damage by the Gastric Acid so Prostaglandin Inhibition reduces Gastric pH to cause Ulceration).
    - Osteoporosis (By stimulating OCs to increase Bone Resorption)
3. Hyperandrogenism ‚Üí Due to increased DHEA Release:
    - Acne (Blocked Hair Follicles due to excess oil production, driven by excess oestrogen and androgens), male-pattern baldness and hirsutism, notably in women due to the normal higher androgenic signalling seen to produce masculine traits.
    - Female pseudohermaphroditism (appearance of both male and female genitalia).
    - Precocious puberty (early puberty) due to increased androgenic signalling.
4. Electrolyte and fluid imbalance:
    - Hypokalaemia
    - Anti-natriuresis (Reduced loss of Na‚Å∫ in urine).
5. Hypervolaemic hypertension due to Na and hence, water retention:
    - Headaches, visual disturbances, stroke.

# Moon Face

- Round, red face
- Supraclavicular fat pads
- Plethoric face + hirsutism - Facial hair development
- All caused by excess adrenal androgens

---

# Why Aren‚Äôt Adrenal Androgens Relevant in a Healthy Male?

- Actions of DHEA are overpowered by that of gonadal testosterone.
- DHEA makes up 2% of total plasma androgen.
- DHEA is very weak in its effects so insignificant in men.

---

# Significance of Adrenal Androgens in Women

- Responsible for adrenarche ‚Üí When There is increased Adrenal Steroid production:
1. Growth of pubic and axillary hair prior to puberty.
2. Acne
- They are important Substrates for post-menopausal oestrogen synthesis in periphery.
- Important for oestrogen-dependent tumours such as Breast and Uterine Cancers.
- Female pseudohermaphroditism ‚Üí Excess Androgens causes masculinisation of external genetalia (Clitoris enlargens or become phallic-like).

---

# Symptoms of Reduced Corticosteroid Action

1. Hypoglycaemia
    - Tiredness and weakness.
    - Vomiting
2. Hyper-Pigmentation
    - Particularly at skin creases, palms of hands and mouth (especially used for Dx of Hyperpigmentation in Px with Darker Skin Tones) due to excessive POMC cleavage to produce high levels of Œ±-MSH.
3. Hypoandrogenism
    - Symptoms only evident in females as men have Gonadal as well as Adrenal Androgens that can maintain normal Androgenic Signalling within the body.
    - Failed adrenarche (Failed Development of Secondary Sexual Characteristics(: little or no body or pubic hair.
    - Sparse axillary and pubic hair growth.
4. Electrolyte and Fluid Imbalance:
    - Natriuresis/hyponatraemia
    - Anti-Kaliuresis (Reduced K+ Loss in Urine)
5. Polyuria leading to polydipsia
6. Hypovolemic hypotension due to increased Na excretion

---

# Stress and Adrenal Gland

- Acute stress: catecholamines.
- Chronic stress: glucocorticoids.
- Elevation of plasma [glucose]:
    1. Reduced carbohydrate metabolism.
    2. ‚Üë fat mobilisation.
    3. ‚Üë protein catabolism.
    4. ‚Üì sensitivity to insulin.

---

# Steroid Complications

- Neuropsychiatric complications of steroid treatment are quite common due to alterations in Œ≤-endorphin levels (produced from POMC Cleavage).
- Specific types of neuropsychiatric impairments comprise a range of symptoms from anxiety, irritability and impaired cognition to depression, mania, psychosis, and suicidal tendency.
- It is clear that these symptoms are common enough and potentially very severe so as to warrant aggressive and early intervention by psychiatric consultants.
