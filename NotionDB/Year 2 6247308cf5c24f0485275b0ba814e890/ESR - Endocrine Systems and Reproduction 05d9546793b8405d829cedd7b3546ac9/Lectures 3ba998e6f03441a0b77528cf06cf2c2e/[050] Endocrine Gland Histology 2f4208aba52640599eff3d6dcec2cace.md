# [050] Endocrine Gland Histology

Progress: Not started

# Endocrine Glands

- These are ductless glands which are involved in the relatively primitive long range (& local) endocrine signalling system
- They are groups of cells that secrete a hormone into extracellular space
- Hormone then diffuses into adjacent capillaries (often fenestrated)

# Pituitary Gland

- Located in a depression of the bony floor of the cranial cavity, known as the sella turcica.
- A short stalk attaches the pituitary to the
hypothalamus known as the pituitary stalk.
- The hypothalamus and pituitary gland form a complex neuro-endocrine
circuit.
- The pituitary comprises two main lobes, which are of different embryological origin:
1. Anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis / pars anterior) - oral ectoderm
2. Intermediate lobe (pars intermedia) - oral ectoderm
- These synthesise numerous peptide hormones
1. posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis / pars nervosa) – neural, from diencephalon releases oxytocin and vasopressin

# Hypothalamus

- Almond-sized portion of the brain whose function is to link the nervous and endocrine systems via the pituitary.
- Vital functions include control of body temperature, hunger, key aspects of parenting/attachment behaviours, thirst, fatigue, sleep and circadian rhythms.
- Hypothalamic neurons in distinct nuclei synthesise peptide releasing hormones (factors) that travel in the portal veins /
capillaries to the anterior pituitary, where they control the production of pituitary peptide hormones.
- Hypothalamic neurons (in paraventricular & supraoptic nuclei) also directly synthesise oxytocin and vasopressin (ADH), which are transported axonally to the posterior pituitary for release.

---

# Hypothalamic Control of the Anterior Pituitary Gland

- This is achieved via releasing hormones
secreted into portal circulation
- Releasing Factors enter Primary Capillaries which arise from the Superior Hypophyseal Artery
- These capillaries then drain into Portal Veins, moving the hormones down the Pituitary Stalk towards the Anterior Pituitary Gland, which in turn drain into Secondary Capillaries surrounding the Anterior Pituitary Gland to stimulate cells in the Anterior Pituitary Gland

---

# Pituitary Vasculature

- Whilst the Superior Hypophyseal Artery is responsible for trafficking Releasing Factors to the Secondary Capillary Plexus surrounding the Anterior Pituitary Gland, the Inferior Hypophyseal Artery forms a anastamosing network of Capillaries that carries hormones from the Posterior Pituitary Gland around the body

# Oxytocin and ADH

- Synthesised in the Paraventricular and Supraoptic Nuclei, which project their axons down the Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal Tract where they reach the Posterior Pituitary Gland to be released from here into the Inferior Hypophyseal Artery

# Anterior Pituitary Gland Histology

- Acidophils - somatotrophs and lactotrophs
- These take up acidic dyes like Eosin and stain pink
- Basophils - Corticotrophs, thyrotrophs and gonadotrophs
- These pick up basic dyes like Haematoxylin and stain a very dark/bright pink
- Chromophobes - quiescent acidophils and basophils
- These do not pick up much stain and hence, stain extremely lightly

# Anterior Pituitary Gland - TEM

- Corticotrophs and Gonadotrophs often appear to have very few secretory granules
- Somatotrophs and Thyrotrophs are rather large and contain a large number of secretory granules so appear highly granular (Somatotrophs appear more granular than Thyrotrophs)
- These are organised around Fenestrated Capillaries

# Thyroid

- Histologically, the Thyroid is identified by numerous round Follicles filled with light pink, amorphous Colloid
- Thyroid Follicles are surrounded by granular CT and small blood vessels, with larger blood vessels found within large CT that appears less granular

![Screenshot 2022-02-12 at 11.42.39.png](%5B050%5D%20Endocrine%20Gland%20Histology%202f4208aba52640599eff3d6dcec2cace/Screenshot_2022-02-12_at_11.42.39.png)

### Inactive Follicle

- Parafollicular C cells are found in spaces between Thyroid Follicles secrete calcitonin
- Thyroid follicle Contains thyroglobulin, which is a storage form of T4 & T3
- They are involved in large scale storage of hormone in inactive form unique among endocrine glands, likely present via evolution due to variable/low iodine supply
- Inactive Follicles can be distinguished as they contain low cuboidal epithelium

- Parathyroid Gland stains much darker purple and more granular than the Thyroid, which generally stains a light pink due to Colloid within Thyroid Follicles
- The Parathyroid Gland lacks a follicular/glandular structure

# Parathyroid Gland

- Chief cells secrete PTH
- These are rather small and are found in densely granulated cell clusters
- Oxyphil cells - unknown function
- These are large cells, containing lots of cytoplasm and hence, are found in less granular clusters
- Adipocytes can also be found within the Parathyroid Gland

# Adrenal Gland

- The Cortex is the superficial layer and the Medulla is the deep layer of the Adrenal Gland

![Screenshot 2022-02-12 at 11.50.29.png](%5B050%5D%20Endocrine%20Gland%20Histology%202f4208aba52640599eff3d6dcec2cace/Screenshot_2022-02-12_at_11.50.29.png)

### Cortex

- This is organised into Columns of tissue running through the width of the Adrenal Cortex
- From Superficial to Deep = Zona Glomerulosa, Zona Fasciculata and Zona Reticularis
- As you move deep, the Adrenal Cortex stains more dark so the Zona Glomerulosa stains the lightest whilst the Zona Reticularis stains the darkest
- The Zona Glomerulosa is very thin, the Zona Fasciculata is the thickest and the Zona Reticularis is of an intermediate thickness
- Zona Reticularis secretes a small amount of Glucocorticoids alongside Adrenal Androgens
- The Zona Fasciculata produces Glucocorticoids and the Zona Glomerulosa produces Mineralocorticoids

### Medulla

- These synthesise Catecholamines

# Pancreas

- The majority of the Pancreas Tissue is exocrine, with a typical glandular organisation of tissue
- Endocrine Tissue is found as small isolated clusters of cells called Islets of Langerhans, which stain a very light pink compared to the surrounding Exocrine tissue that stains dark pink/purple
- Islets Contain:
1. α Cells - Glucagon
2. β Cells - Insulin and Amylin
3. γ Cells - Somatostatin
- These cells cannot be distinguished from one another using H&E - Special Stains must be used to differentiate different cell types (E.g Immunohistochemical Staining)
