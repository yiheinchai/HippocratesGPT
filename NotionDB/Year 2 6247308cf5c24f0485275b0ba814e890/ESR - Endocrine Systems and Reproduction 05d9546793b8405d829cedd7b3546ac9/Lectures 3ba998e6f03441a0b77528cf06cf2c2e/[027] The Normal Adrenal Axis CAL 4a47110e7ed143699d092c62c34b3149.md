# [027] The Normal Adrenal Axis CAL

Progress: Parked

# Adrenals

- Zona Fasciculata = 80% of the Cortical Volume
- Zona Reticularis produces androgens like DHEA and Testosterone

---

# Steroid Hormone

- There are 5 classes:
1. Progestins (C21)
2. Glucocorticoids (C21)
3. Mineralocorticoids (C21)
4. Androgens (C19)
5. Oestrogens (C18)
- Progestins → Secretion of Uterine nutrients and inhibit contractions of the Myometrium to allow for Fetal growth
- Androgens → Masculinisation via Sperm maturation and development of male secondary sex characteristics (Pubic, Axillary and Facial Hair Growth etc.)
- Oestrogens → Feminisation and development of secondary sex characteristics (E.g Breast Growth)

# HPA Axis

- CRH stimulates ACTH-Basophilic Cells in the Anterior Pituitary Gland, which released ACTH to act on the Adrenal Cortex but also the Hypothalamus to inhibit further CRH Release
- Cortisol feeds back to the Anterior Pituitary Gland and Hypothalamus to inhibit ACTH and CRH release from these respectively
- Paraventricular Neurons that synthesise ADH release it into the Median Eminence, to be transporter to the Anterior Pitutiary Gland via the Hypophyseal Portal System
- ADH is not a significant stimulator of ACTH secretion but augments the effects of CRH so that there is greater ACTH Release

---

# Hormones of the HPA Axis

### CRH

- 41 AA Hypothalamic Releasing Hormone that act on Corticotrophs
- It stimulates:
1. Increased expression of the gene encoding Pre-POMC
2. Processing of POMC Glycoprotein by Endopeptidases to generate Pro-ACH and β-Lipotrophic Hormone
3. Secretion of ACTH by promoting fusion of ACTH Vesicles with the Corticotroph plasma membrane

### ACTH

- 39 AA Hormone
- ACTH can be cleaved by endopeptidases to produce α-MSH
- ACTH acts to increase adrenal steroid biosynthesis by increasing:
1. Uptake of cholesterol substrate (in the form of plasma lipoproteins)
2. Expression of StAR protein
3. Activity of key steroidogenic enzymes
4. Expression of key steroidogenic enzymes.

- As ACTH production is dependent on the action of CRH, which is under negative feedback control by cortisol, Cortisol inhibits further endocrine stimulation of the ZF and ZR by ACTH
- CRH, ACTH and Cortisol show parallel circadian rhythms, with a peak in the morning, near when an individual wakes up, before slowly declining over the rest of the day to reach its lowest concentrations at around 9pm
- Peaks and decline of CR and ACTH precede that of Cortisol

# Steroid Hormone Physiology

- DHEA and Cortisol Synthesis is dependent on ACTH Synthesis whilst Aldosterone synthesis is ACTH-Sensitive, with ACTH stimulating Aldosterone biosynthesis but a decrease in ACTH having minimal effects on Aldosterone Production
- Albumin binds all steroid hormones with low affinity but high capacity.
- Corticosteroid and Sex Hormone-binding globulin binds cortisol and other corticosteroids and Androgens respectively with a high affinity but has a low capacity.
- Around 90% of plasma cortisol circulates bound to corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) while the majority of aldosterone circulates in association with serum albumin

### Inactivation and Excretion

- As Steroid Hormones are hydrophobic and hence, transported in the blood bound to Plasma Proteins that are not filtered
- Conjugation by liver, and to a lesser extent the kidneys, converts the water–insoluble hormone to an inactive but water–soluble form (Conjugated).
- In this Hydrophilic Form, it can be filtered into the Urine
- 75% of the Conjugated Hormone is excreted via Kidneys and around 25% is excreted via the Biliary System
- Steroid Hormones’ Synthesis rate is directly proportional to their secretion rate and hence, Blood [ ]

# Adrenal Cortical Hormone Synthesis

- The Majority of Cholesterol is synthesised in the Liver and carried in the Plasma, bound to VLDL
- When androgens are secreted, enzymes in the peripheral tissues produce oestrogens (in adipose tissue) and dihydrotestosterone (in skin) from the androgens formed in the Zona Reticularis.
- Glucocorticoids and Mineralocorticoids = Corticosteroids
- Cytochrome P450 Cholesterol Side Chain Cleave (P450 CSCC) cleaves 6Cs from C27 Cholesterol
- Since this reaction is catalysed in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion, short half-life proteins (e.g. the steroidogenic acute regulatory [StAR] protein is required to transport cholesterol across the aqueous space between the two mitochondrial membranes).
- Once formed, pregnenolone passes out of the mitochondrion and into the ER where it is acted upon by a series of steroidogenic enzymes which are derived from 2 families:
1. Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases (HSDs)
2. Cytochrome P450 Enzyme
- The most potent stimulus of Aldosterone synthesis and secretion is plasma K+ concentration
- Increased K+ concentration depolarises the zona glomerulosa cells, thereby opening membrane Ca2+ channels. The increased cell Ca2+ is a potent stimulator of aldosterone production.
- Angiotensin II causes net Na+ reabsorption and K+ Excretion
- Aldosterone is required for maintaining Normovolaemia and Normokalaemia
- There is no hormonal negative feedback control.

# Actions of Glucocorticoids

- In order to elevate the plasma glucose concentration, Cortisol must increase:
1. the expression of those gluconeogenic enzymes required to bypass the irreversible steps in the glycocolytic pathway
2. the availability of amino-acids as gluconeogenic substrates
3. the use of alternative respiratory substrates (to spare glucose oxidation).
- The ability of cortisol to stimulate the breakdown of muscle protein and connective tissue contributes to the wasting associated with elevated concentrations of cortisol in syndromes of adrenal hyperactivity (e.g. chronic stress).

---

# DHEA

- Weak steroid with low affinity for AR
- Since the adrenal gland contains a steroid sulphotransferase enzyme, DHEA tends to leave the adrenal cortex as dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS).
- In potential target cells, the sulphate is removed by a steroid sulphatase enzyme.
- DHEA is of little importance in Young Males as the testes produce Androstenedione and Testosterone, more potent androgens which are responsible for the majority of masculinisation and development of secondary sexual characteristics
- In females, puberty is divided into Andrenarche, Pubarche and Menarche
- Since the output of androgens from the ovaries is very limited in a healthy girl, adrenarche (the female pattern of androgen-dependent hair growth) relies on the adrenal androgen, DHEAS.
- After desulphation, this weak steroid can undergo conversion in peripheral tissues (e.g. adipose and skin) to the more potent androgens, androstenedione, testosterone and 5α dihydrotestosterone.
- DHEA can also be metabolised (in peripheral tissues – particularly adipose tissue) to oestrogens.
- This is particularly important in post-menopausal women when the peripheral synthesis of oestradiol from adrenal DHEA exceeds the output of oestradiol from the ovaries.
- Hence, androgens produced in the adrenal cortex can (via conversion to oestrogens) support the growth of oestrogen-dependent tumours (e.g. breast and uterine tumours and carcinomas) in post-menopausal women.

# Aldosterone

- In general, primary increased hormone secretion results from general gland enlargement (hyperplasia) or from tumours within the gland, while primary decreased hormone secretion results from gland hypoplasia or destruction

### Hyperaldosteronism

- Increased Na+ Reabsorption in Distal Tubule, leading to increased K+ and H+ Secretion (Causing Hypokalaemia and Metabolic Alkalosis)
- Increased Na+ reabsorption causes hypervolaemia and hypertension

### Hypoaldosteronism

- Decreased Na+ Reabsorption in Distal Tubule, leading to decreased K+ and H+ Secretion (Causing Hyperkalaemia and Metabolic Acidosis)
- Decreased Na+ reabsorption causes hypovolaemia and hypotension

---

# Cortisol

- Increasingly, however, symptoms and signs of overproduction of glucocorticoids are associated with their therapeutic use, largely as anti-inflammatory agents.
- Increased Glucocorticoids → Hyperglycaemia → Weight Gain due to suppression of Apetitie
- Sleeping Difficulties due to decreased melatonin secretion
- Impaired memory
- Reduced Calcium absorption and increased bone catabolism, leading to Negative Calcium Balance.
- Bone Resorption leads to Osteoporosis
- Tendon degredation due to Glucocorticoids inhibits Collagen Synthesis → Also leads to Skin Fragility and easy bruising
- Immunodeficiency

### Causes of Decreased Glucocorticoid Production

- Most common acute cause is overtreatment with Glucocorticoids
- This suppresses Adrenal Glucocorticoid Synthesis, leading to gradual Adrenal Gland Atrophy
- It also suppresses Hypothalamic CRH and Anterior Pituitary ACTH Production
- If the glucocorticoid treatment is suddenly stopped, the person's own gland can not supply the needed hormone, causing Adrenal Insufficiency
- Decreased Production can arise from:
1. Diseases affecting the adrenal gland that limit cortisol production.
2. Diseases affecting the anterior pituitary that decrease its production of ACTH
3. Diseases affecting the hypothalamus that decrease its production of CRH.
- Plasma hormone levels in different conditions that result in decreased hormone production:
- Hypothalamic damage: ↓ CRH, ↓ ACTH, ↓ cortisol.
- Anterior pituitary damage: ↑ CRH, ↓ ACTH, ↓ cortisol.
- Adrenal gland damage: ↑ CRH, ↑ ACTH, ↓ cortisol.

# Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia/CAH

- Salt-Wasting CAH

![Screenshot 2022-01-30 at 15.50.05.png](%5B027%5D%20The%20Normal%20Adrenal%20Axis%20CAL%204a47110e7ed143699d092c62c34b3149/Screenshot_2022-01-30_at_15.50.05.png)

- Salt-Sparing/Simple Virilising CAH

![Screenshot 2022-01-30 at 15.50.16.png](%5B027%5D%20The%20Normal%20Adrenal%20Axis%20CAL%204a47110e7ed143699d092c62c34b3149/Screenshot_2022-01-30_at_15.50.16.png)

- CAH raised due to loss-of-function mutations or decreased expression of adrenal steroidogenic enzymes.
- This relates in little or no synthesis of cortisol (or corticosterone) and aldosterone.
- Due to decreased negative feedback from lack of cortisol there are elevated levels of ACTH.
- ACTH causes hyperplasia of the adrenal.
- Increased Deoxycortisterone/DOC Production in Salt-Sparing CAH due to increased ACTH Levels
- In Salt-Sparing CAH, high ACTH Drive leads to increased DOC Production but without raised Aldosterone and Cortisol production.
- Low aldosterone and cortisol further increase ACTH production and as normal endocrine negative feedback mechanism do not regulate DOC Production, this produces a positive feedback loop that causes malignant/uncontrolled hypertension

# Cortisol and Androgen

- Despite being present in significantly larger [ ] and having a similar receptor affinity to Aldosterone, Cortisol cannot overpower the effects of Aldosterone
- This is because Aldosterone stimulates 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2  which oxidises cortisol to cortisone that does not bind to the Aldosterone Receptor, allowing the aldosterone receptor to respond to cellular aldosterone levels without interference by Cortisol
- The active ingredient in licorice, glycyrrhizin, inhibits this enzyme and so people habitually consuming licorice can develop secondary hyper–aldosteronism.
