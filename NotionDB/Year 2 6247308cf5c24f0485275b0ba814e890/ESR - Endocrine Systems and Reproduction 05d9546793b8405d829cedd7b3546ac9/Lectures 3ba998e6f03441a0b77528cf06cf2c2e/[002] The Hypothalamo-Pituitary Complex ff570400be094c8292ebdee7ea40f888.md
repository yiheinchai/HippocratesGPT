# [002] The Hypothalamo-Pituitary Complex

Progress: Not started

# Types of Endocrine Disorders

- Primary endocrine disorder (from where hormone production goes wrong): Cushing‚Äôs disease.
- Secondary endocrine disorder (lack of particular hormone, and/or lack of receptor for hormone): insulin-resistance.
- Corticosteroids are used in treatment of non-endocrine conditions (i.e. inflammation).

---

# Pituitary Gland

- Protected at base of brain in sphenoid bone (sphenoid process).
- Connected by pituitary stalk (blood vessels transporting chemical signals to anterior pituitary gland).
- Anterior pituitary: cup of tissue around posterior pituitary.
- Easiest way to access the Pituitary Gland is through the Back of the Nose, breaking through the Sphenoid and passing through the Sphenoidal Air Sinus to reach the Sella Turcica and Pituitary Gland

# Pituitary Gland Development

- Anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis): develops from roof of mouth (Ectodermal Tissue) and grows up/superiorly.
- Rathke‚Äôs pouch: evagination at roof of mouth in front of buccopharyngeal membrane which forms the Anterior Pituitary Gland
- This gives rise to anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis).
- Posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis): forms from neural tissue from
basal floor of diencephalon and grows
down/inferiorly.
- It grows to meet an upgrowth from mouth of embryo.
- There is a cleft between these 2 tissues in adult but these are wrapped around one another.

# Posterior Pituitary Gland

- Smaller of 2 lobes.
- Large bodied neurones in hypothalamus send projections down through pituitary stalk and terminate in posterior pituitary.
- Hence, due to its origin from Nervous Tissue, it contains the terminal ends of Hypothalamic Neurons
- In posterior pituitary, a series of nerve endings release chemical components in posterior pituitary area where they enter a vascular plexus which has blood coming in via inferior hypophyseal artery and leaves plexus to body.
- Paraventricular nucleus: sit and line base of 3rd V.
- Supraoptic nucleus: collection of neuronal cell bodies sits to side of optic chiasma.

### Posterior Pituitary Hormones

- Neurohypophyseal hormones:
1. Oxytocin (OT): stimulates smooth muscles.
2. Vasopressin (arginine vasopressin) (AVP)/anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) (same thing). 2 names because it has 2
receptors.
- Synthesised in cell bodies of magnocellular (Large Cell Body) neurones (PVN (paraventricular nucleus) and SON  (supra-optic nucleus)).
- They are transported down axons from hypothalamus to posterior pituitary.

---

# Anterior Pituitary Gland

- Hypothalamus releases small peptide releasing hormones which act and are transported down hypophyseal portal system.
- Blood vessels are leaky and contain pores which allow uptake from the blood into the pituitary gland.
- Median eminence: area of fenestrated blood vessels which acts as a funnel which ship contents of hypothalamus down hypophyseal portal system  in the pituitary stalk to anterior pituitary cells.
- Within anterior pituitary, there is a range of different cell types, determined by a range of transcription factors and each cell produces just 1 or 2 hormones in response to a specific releasing hormone.
- Secretion of Tropic Hormones from Anterior Pituitary is controlled by Releasing Hormones, produced by Hypothalamic Neurons and released into the Medial Eminence

# Anterior Pituitary Cell Types

| Cell Population | Secreted Hormone | Endocrine Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thyrotrophs | TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) | Stimulate Synthesis and Secretion of Thyroid Hormones from Thyroid |
| Gonadotrophs | Gonadotrophins - LH (Lutenising Hormone) and FSH (Follicle-Stimulating Hormone) | Stimulate Steroid Biosynthesis and Germ Cell Maturation in the Gonads |
| Corticotrophs | ACTH (Adrenocorticotrophic Hormone) | Stimulate Steroid Biosynthesis in the Adrenal Cortex |
| Somatotrophs | Somatotrophin = GH (Growth Hormone) | Stimulate Growth directly or via IGF-1 from the Liver |
| Lactotrophs | Prolactin | Stimulates Lactation |

---

# Anterior Pituitary Hormones

| Hormone | Information |
| --- | --- |
| TSH, LH and FSH | Heterodimeric glycoproteins They have a common ùõº-subunit but specific ùõΩ-subunits for each individual hormone (TSHùõΩ, LHùõΩ and FSHùõΩ) |
| ACTH | 39AA Fragment of POMC (Proopiomelanocortin). POMC also produces Opioids and MSHs |
| GH and PRL | 190AA Peptides (With Internal Disulphide Bonds) with Homologous/Similar Receptors |

# Pars Intermedia/Intermediate Lobe

- Boundary between anterior and posterior lobes.
- Pars intermedia is closely associated with pars nervosa of the Posterior Pituitary Gland and separated from pars distalis of the Anterior Pituitary Gland by hypophyseal cleft (remnant of Rathke‚Äôs pouch).
- This lobe of pituitary shows considerable variation in size among species (small in man but much larger in amphibians).
- Melanocyte-stimulating hormone is predominant hormone secreted here.

# Hypothalamic Factors and Releasing Hormones

### Hypothalamic Factors

- Synthesis and secretion of anterior pituitary hormones can be under dual control of:
1. Hypothalamic releasing hormones.
2. Hypothalamic inhibitory factors.
- Synthesised in parvocellular (small cell body) neurones and secreted into the median eminence of 3rd V where they travel down the Hypophyseal Portal Vessels.

### Hypothalamic Releasing Hormones

| Hormone | Amino Acid | Stimulates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TRH (Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone) | 3 | Thyrotropin (TSH) |
| GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) | 10 | Gonadotrophins (LH and FSH) |
| CRH (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone) | 41 | Corticotrophin (ACTH) |
| GHRH (Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone) | 44 | GH |

---

# Dual Control of GH Secretion

- Hypothalamic stimulating factor GHRH travels down the Hypophyseal Portal Vessels and activates GPCR expressed on Somatotrophs on anterior pituitary to produce GH.
- GH is released and acts systemically .
- 1 site of action is on liver, where it induces production of IGF-1.
- -ve feedback loop means production of IGF-1 can ‚Üì GH in anterior pituitary and inhibit release of GHRH to regulate amount of GH released into circulation.
- GH is also controlled by somatostatin, which is produced near GHRH neurones and has a -ve effect on GH production by inhibiting cellular activity (Hypothalamic Inhibitory Factor)
- Couples to ùê∫ùëñ to ‚Üì cyclic AMP generation in cell and ‚Üì intracellular signalling to reduce GH.
- Somatostatin Inhibition of GH reduces IGF-1 Stimulation, which removes Inhibition of GHRH Secretion, allowing for GHRH and hence, GH Levels to increase again
- Both IGF-1 and GH can stimulate Somatostatin release to reduce the activity of the GH Axis
- Advantage of dual control is to give fine control of tuning on and off systems where tight control of action is required.
- External factors affect many endocrine factors.
- Stress inhibits GHRH and sees a ‚Üì in GH output within axis.
- Rule: anterior pituitary stimulated by specific hypothalamic releasing hormones (and may be suppressed by hypothalamic inhibitory factors).
- Prolactin appears to be under dominant  -ve control by dopamine (from arcuate nucleus) so that DA Stimulation Inhibits Prolactin Release (Release is produced by Reduced DA Stimulation).
- This ensures that Prolactin is inhibited for the majority of the time and only activated when Lactation is required

# Levels of and Overriding Negative Feedback

- Axes connect different levels within the Endocrine System (Hyppothalmus ‚Üí Pituitary Gland ‚Üí Endocrine Gland ‚Üí Target)
- Short loop (from anterior pituitary to hypothalamus):
1. Effects of LH/FSH on GnRH.
2. Effects of GH on GHRH.
- Long loop (from outside hypothalamo-pituitary complex):
1. Effects on gonadal steroids on GnRH.
2. Effects of corticosteroids on CRH.
- Within these axes, the Target Hormone produced by the Axes signals back to Inhibit the Release of the Hypothalamic Releasing Hormone and Pituitary Tropic Hormone to reduce the activity of the Axis
- The Tropic Factor also inhibits the release of the Hypothalamic Releasing Factor in order to tightly regulate the secretion of the Releasing Hormone and Tropic Hormone to maintain desired levels of the Target Hormone
- If there is Low Trophic Hormone, there is usually low Target Hormone and Raised Releasing Factor
- Presence of Normal Target Hormones but no effect ‚Üí Receptor Mutation

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 14.39.13.png](%5B002%5D%20The%20Hypothalamo-Pituitary%20Complex%20ff570400be094c8292ebdee7ea40f888/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_14.39.13.png)

### Overriding Negative Feedback

- Higher centres of brain can override hypothalamo-pituitary drive to endocrine axis.
- Chronic stress:
1. Overrides -ve feedback on CRH and ACTH to increase CRH and ACTH Production (hyperactivity in adrenal axis). 
2. Loss of GnRH and GHRH ‚Üí This inhibits the HPG Axis
- Whilst Acute Stress is mediated by Adrenaline from the Adrenal Medulla, Chronic Stress is mediated by Cortisol from the Adrenal Cortex

# Functional Disconnection of Pituitary Gland

- Cranial trauma: can disconnect hypothalamus from pituitary by damaging Hypothalamic Neurons or Hypophyseal Portal System (Usually Front End).
- Can cause hyperprolactinaemia and reduced levels of Anterior Pituitary Hormones.
- Pressure on pituitary stalk: pituitary tumour or inflammation.
- Inflammation/infection: cytokines.
- Mid-line defects can affect the Pituitary Gland as the Pituitary Gland is found in the Midline, causing loss of the Anterior and Posterior Pituitary Glands.
- Defects in migration of hypothalamic neurones: Kallman‚Äôs syndrome.
- GnRH neurones are produced in nasal placodes and migrate to hypothalamus.
- Neurones in Kallman‚Äôs syndrome do not produce right gonadotrophins (responsible for steroid production, and hormones are key to fusing long bones).
- Patients are tall, thin, often have deficits in smell and taste.
- This prevents the completion of puberty.

# Hyposecretion and Hypersecretion of Selected Anterior Pituitary Hormones

### Hyposecretion

- Adenohypophyseal cells: sensitive to irradiation, particularly somatotrophs (Therefore, GH Secretion can be affected by Radiation in Cancer Rx).
- Hyposecretion of individual anterior pituitary hormones: rare.

### Hypersecretion

- Functional pituitary tumours are rare.
- Most common is prolactinomas (become biggest in men) which cause Hypersecretion of Prolactin.
- Often identified by visual field loss rather than endocrine status.
1. Galactorrhoea: spontaneous flow of milk from breasts in men and women not associated with childbirth or nursing.
2. Gynaecomastia 
3. Infertility: prolactin suppression of HPG axis. Postpartum (A woman breastfeeding does not get pregnant straight away, this is due to -ve feedback of prolactin inhibiting HPG axis).
- ACTH-hypersecretion:
- From pituitary corticotrophs (Cushing‚Äôs disease).
- Ectopic: from small cell lung tumours.
- GH secretion:
1. Gigantism: in infancy.
2. Acromegaly: in adulthood (Bones are fused but Cartilage and Organs continue to grow).
- TSH hypersecretion: (very rare)
- High [TSH] usually reflects hypothyroidism and hence, lack of negative feedback inhibition of TSH production

# Oxytocin

- 9 AA peptide that is synthesised in hypothalamic neurones in posterior
pituitary.
- Secreted from few other tissues, including ovaries and testes.
- Differs from ADH in 2 of 9 amino acids.
- Both hormones are packaged into  granules and secreted along with carrier proteins called neurophysins.

# Cellular Actions of Oxytocin ‚Üí Positive Feedback Mechanisms

### Stimulation of Milk Ejection (Milk Letdown)

- Milk is initially secreted into small sacs within mammary gland called alveoli, from which it must be ejected for
consumption or storage.
- Baby Sucking on the Nipple activates Mechanorecetors in the Nipple that signals to Higher Brain Centres to increase Oxytocin Synthesis in the Hypothalamus and its release from the Posterior Pituitary Gland
- Oxytocin stimulates contraction of myoepithelial cells that line the mamillary alveoli, causing milk within the alveoli to be ejected into ducts and cisterns and released from the nipple.
- This release of Milk produces increase Nipple Sucking to get more milk, causing increased Milk Production in a positive feedback mechanism
- Hypothalamus also inhibits the Inhibitory Dopaminergic Neuron, disinhibiting Prolactin Secreting Cells in the Anterior Pituitary Gland to increase Prolactin Secretion and hence, milk secretion into Alveoli and Lactiferous Ducts
- This positive feedback loop ends when Mechanoreceptor stimulation ends
- Sound of a Child‚Äôs Cry can also activate this Milk Letdown reflex via the activation of Higher Brain Centres to Disinhibit Prolactin production and stimulate Oxytocin Release

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 14.53.53.png](%5B002%5D%20The%20Hypothalamo-Pituitary%20Complex%20ff570400be094c8292ebdee7ea40f888/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_14.53.53.png)

### Stimulate Uterine Smooth Muscle Contractions at Birth (Parturition)

- During later stages of gestation, oxytocin receptors are upregulated on uterine smooth muscle cells, which is associated with increased "irritability" of uterus which give rise to Braxton-Hicks Contraction (Frequently near the end of the Pregnancy).
- When the foetus‚Äô head is pressed against the cervix, it stretches it, signalling to the Hypothalamus to increase the Synthesis of Oxytocin, causing Increased Oxytocin release from the PPG
- Oxytocin causes the Uterine Smooth Muscle to facilitate Parturition and move the Baby out of the Uterus, causing it to further stretch the Cervix and stimulate increased Oxytocin Release via a Positive Feedback loop
- This Positive Feedback loop ends when Parturition has been complete as the Cervix is no longer stretched
- In cases where uterine contractions are not sufficient to complete delivery/labour, oxytocin analogues can be given to stimulate Uterine Smooth Muscle contraction but this must be given carefully to prevent excessive smooth muscle contractions that can tear muscles.

### Establishment of Maternal Behaviour

- Successful reproduction in mammals demands that mothers become attached to and nourish their offspring immediately after birth.
- Non-lactating females do not manifest such nurturing behaviour.
- During parturition, there is an ‚Üë [Oxytocin] in CSF, and oxytocin acting within brain plays a major role in establishing maternal behaviour (Bonding Behaviour between 2 Individuals) after birth.
- Physical touch from the Mother exhibiting Bonding Behaviour causes Oxytocin release within the Baby, causing Bonding behaviour and increased physical contact in the Infant
- This acts to stimulate increased Oxytocin Release and Bonding Behaviour int he Mother, producing a Positive Feedback Cycle

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 14.56.33.png](%5B002%5D%20The%20Hypothalamo-Pituitary%20Complex%20ff570400be094c8292ebdee7ea40f888/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_14.56.33.png)

### Positive Feedback Spirals and Oxytocin Secretion

- Oxytocin secretion stimulated by +ve feedback (mediated by neural reflexes):
1. Suckling reflex: act of nursing or suckling is relayed within a few ms to brain via a spinal reflex arc. 
- These signals impinge on oxytocin-secreting neurones, leading to release of oxytocin.
1. Fergusson reflex: stimulation of uterine smooth muscle contractions at birth
- Most of Endocrine Regulation is via negative vs positive feedback in order to tightly regulate Hormonal Activity and stabilise the body system
