# Female Reproductive System

- Broad ligament: wide fold of peritoneum that connects sides of uterus to walls and floor of pelvis, supporting the ovary.
- Ovarian ligament: fibrous ligament that connects ovary to lateral surface of uterus.
- Infundibulum: This has fimbriae at its distal end and extends from oviduct, moving to surrounding the ovary at the time of ovulation to catch the released Oocyte that erupts from the Graafian Follicle.

# Components of the Female Reproductive System

- Ovaries: produce oocytes and female sex hormones (oestrogens, progestogens).
- Uterine tubes (oviducts, Fallopian tube): conducts ova towards uterus.
- Fertilisation occurs along tube (at the ampulla → Where the Fallopian Tubes bend).
- Uterus: where embryo implants and grows.
- Cervix: lower part/neck of uterus that becomes a narrowing.
- Vagina: site of introduction of spermatozoa.
- It is also the birth canal.
- Breasts: production of colostrum and milk that provides Nutrition to the newborn.

### Ovaries

- Produce Ova via Oogenesis
- They produce the female sex hormones:
1. Oestrogens via the action of Aromatase in Granulosa cells on Androgen Precursors produced by Thecal Cellls
2. Inhibin → Produced by Granulosa Cells and Inhibits FSH
3. Progesterone → Corpus Luteum

### Follicles

- Ovaries contain a large number of Primordial Follicles that are found in a resting state
- Each month, 20 or so are activated and begin to enlarge and become primary follicles.
- Oocyte enlarges considerably, becoming surrounded by Follicular Cells which develop into Thecal Cells and Granulosa Cells, and follicular antrum (space) appears.
- Once the Follicular Antrum forms, it is now known as a secondary follicle and it continues to enlarge until it becomes a mature (Graafian) follicle.
- Secondary and Graafian Follicles then begins to bulge against wall of ovary, giving knobular/lumpy appearance to the ovary.
- 1 Graafian follicle erupts (ovulation) through wall of ovary.
- Granulosa cells reorganise and re differentiate to form cells of corpus luteum, which produces oestrogen and progesterone.
- If fertilisation does not
occur, this temporary endocrine gland degenerates, becoming
corpus albicans (remnant of Scar Tissue).
- The number of Corpora Albicantia found within an Ovary can be used to age the Ovary

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.26.16.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.26.16.png)

- Primordial Follicles are very small, pale dots found just deep to the Epithelial Covering of the Ovary, embedded in the Cortex
- Secondary Follicles are identified by the Presence of the Clear-Staining Follicular Antrum at the centre of the Spherical Follicle
- In Histological Sections, many sections may not capture the Oocyte within the Follicle, making the Follicle appear hollow → If an Oocyte is caught in the Plane of the Section, it will be a pink small sphere found embedded in the Inner wall of the Follicle (Rest of Ovary stains purple)
- Graafian Follicle is very large and found near the Outer Wall of the Ovary (May not look near the Edge in the Plane of Section of the Slide), with a well defined Cumulus Oophorous
- Human Ovaries have fewer Secondary Follicles than Cat Ovaries

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.27.37.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.27.37.png)

- Primordial follicles are pale dots within Superficial cortex. Large clear spaces are follicular antrum.

# Follicles

### Primordial Follicle

- Surrounded by a protective layer of follicular cells.
- Surrounding Stroma is densely cellular and likely contains Follicular Cell Precursors
- 500,000 primordial follicles in human ovary at birth.
- Arrested in 1st meiotic division (prophase I).
- 20/month begin maturation, and usually only 1 ovulates.

![Screenshot 2022-02-06 at 12.35.13.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-06_at_12.35.13.png)

### Primary Follicle

- This is found deeper in the Ovary than the Primordial Follicles
- Here, the Oocyte stains a light pink and is relatively amorphous
- The Follicular Cells can be found as two distinct layers here:
1. Granulosa Cells surrounding the now enlarged Oocyte and the Inner Wall of the Follicle
2. Thecal Cells forming the Outer wall of the Follicle

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.29.18.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.29.18.png)

### Secondary/Graafian Follicle

- Zone pellucida is jelly-like layer that is found between the Corona Radiata and the Oocyte (Stains light pink), connected to the Inner wall of the Granulosa Cells via the Cumulus Oophorus (Stain dark purple)
- Granulosa Cells can be seen forming the Cumulus Oophorus and lining the Inner Wall of the Follicle.
- Thecal Cells can be found distinguished into a Deep Theca Interna and Superficial Theca Externa
- Secondary follicle produces oestrogen and progesterone.
- A high concentration of these steroid hormones is required, so many (20 or so) of these follicles help to achieve this concentration.

# Oocyte Development

- Corpus Luteum formed by the Remaining Granulosa Cells of the Graafian Follicle can either form a Corpus Albicans if Pregnancy does not occur (Small, irregularly shaped/folded Yellow-White Structure) or Corpus Luteum of Pregancy (Enlarged Corpus Luteum)

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.30.29.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.30.29.png)

---

# Fertilisation and Implantation

- Ciliated Cuboidal/Columnar Epithelial cells that line the oviducts slowly waft the Zygote down the Oviduct and into the Uterus at around Day 4 of Embryogenesis, where it is implanted into the Endometrium around Day 8 of Embryogenesis

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.30.53.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.30.53.png)

# Ovary During Pregnancy

- The Corpus Luteus of Pregnancy is significantly enlarged to occupy the Majority of the Space within the Ovary
- The Granulosa Cells of the Corpus Luteum of Pregnancy appear highly folded (Almost looks like how the Intestines appear Macroscopically) and the centre of the Corpus Luteum is filled with very lightly pink amorphous material with large, clear-staining spaces within it
- The formation of the Corpus Luteum of Pregnancy is stimulated by hCG secreted by the Human Placenta following Implantation
- hCG has a similar function to LH where it stimulates the production of Oestrogen and Progesterone from the Corpus Luteum
- Thecal Cells producing Oestrogen Precurors are found superficial, with precursors travelling deep to enter the Granulosa Cells where they are converted into Progesterone and Oestrogen via Aromatase
- Around Week 9-10 of Pregnancy, the Placenta takes over the production of Female Sex Steroids and the Corpus Luteum degenerates and involuted to form a Corpus Albicans
- These Corpora Albicantia are very small structure found superficial to the Corpus Luteum and are completely filled with an light-pink amorphous material (Fibrous Scar Tissue)
- The Hilum of the Ovary is found at the Distal Tip of the Ovary and is where the Blood Vessels supplying the Ovary enter → This is a highly vascular region that stains more pink than the remainder of the Ovary and contains more artefacts

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.31.13.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.31.13.png)

# Uterine Tubes/Oviducts/Fallopian Tubes

- Conduct ova towards uterus, fertilisation occurs along tube.
- Simple cuboidal/columnar epithelium of ciliated cells and secretory cells.
- Image = Section through the Ampullary Region
- In the Fallopian Tube, the Epithelial Lining is highly folded
- Ciliated Cells lining these Epithelial Folds are responsible for moving the Oocyte towards the Uterus and Non-Ciliated Epithelial Cells secrete fluid that surrounds and protects the Zygote whilst in the Oviduct
- Surrounding the Highly Folded Epithelia of the Oviduct are layers of smooth muscle, with large blood vessels embedded within

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.31.54.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.31.54.png)

# Uterus

- Where embryo implants and grows.
- Simple and secretory columnar epithelium with uterine glands, cervix.
- Cyclical monthly changes:
1. Proliferation: endometrium doubles in thickness. 
- Simple tubular glands form.
1. Secretion: begins with ovulation.
- Glycogen is main nutritive product produced by tubular glands.
- Endometrium reaches maximum thickness and is highly vascular.
1. Degeneration (menstruation): in absence of implantation of fertilised ovum.

---

# Hormonal Integration

- LH and FSH spike at ovulation.
- Driven by feedback from oestrogen
produced by follicles.
- Oestrogen peaks and decreases.
- During luteal phase, oestrogen and progesterone peak.
- It is during this point that endometrium reaches maximal thickness.
- If fertilisation does not occur, progesterone (and oestrogen) levels
↓
- Falling progesterone levels causes endometrium to degenerate (menstruation)

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.33.08.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.33.08.png)

# Menstrual Cycle

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.34.16.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.34.16.png)

# Proliferative Phase of the Uterus

- Uterus is comprised of 3 layers from deep to superficial → Stratum Functionalis, Stratum Basalis and Myometrium
- Stratum Functionalis + Stratum Basalis = Endometrium
- Stratum Functionalis is a thick layer of Temporary Tissue that is rapidly developed and degenerates if Fertilisation does not occur.
- It also stains deep purple
- Stratum Basalis is a permanent layer of the Uterus that contains major blood vessels
- This region contains a small amount of Deep Purple Tissue like the Stratum Functionalis but contains lots of light pink staining vessels (not found in the the Stratum Functionalis) and contains more artefacts (formed via Vessel Lumens) → Hence, this layer appears more disorganised than the Stratum Functionalis
- Myometrium is a very light staining Pink muscular layer found superficial to the Stratum Basalis and appear much more organised than the Stratum Basalis, with fewer artefacts
- The Lumen of the Uterus is very small when the Woman is not pregnant
- Uterine gland produces glycogen and are typically located within stratum functionalis with a basal root in the Stratum Basalis.
- The Arcuate Arteries that arise from the Uterine Artery run through and supply the Myometrium
- From these Arcuate Arteries, Straight Arteries arise that run deep through the Stratum Basalis and Supply it
- These Straight Arteries then become highly coiled to form the Spiral Arteries that are found running in and supplying the Stratum Functionalis
- At the end of the Menstrual Cycle, the rapid and pronounced decrease in Progesterone due to the degeneration of the Corpus Luteum causes the Spiral Arteries to constrict, causing Ischaemia and eventually necrosis of the Stratum Functionalis, which causes it to degenerate and be shed during Menses

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.35.08.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.35.08.png)

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.35.30.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.35.30.png)

- The Stratum Functionalis is highly cellular/granular in comparison to the Stratum Basalis
- The Stratum Basalis is fibromuscular Tissue, staining a lighter pink than the deep purple Stratum Functionalis, containing organised layers of Fibromuscular Tissue, with small artefacts sometimes being seen between these layers

![Screenshot 2022-02-06 at 13.11.52.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-06_at_13.11.52.png)

---

# Menstruation Phase of the Uterus

- Stratum Functionalis becomes extremely dark staining in comparison to the Stratum Basalis
- Many Artefacts are seen within the Stratum Functionalis as it is necrotic and being shed into the Uterine Lumen

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.36.08.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.36.08.png)

# Vagina and Cervix

- Vagina: site of introduction of spermatozoa and also the birth canal.
- It is lined with stratified squamous epithelium.
- Lubricated by cervical mucus derived from rich vascular network and mucus from glands in labia minora.
- Cervix: neck of uterus which contributes to the superior aspect of the birth canal.
- It is lined with Simple epithelium (abrupt transition with stratified squamous epithelium of vagina is frequent site of malignant transformation).
- The Neck of the Cervix can be seen projecting into the Superior Wall of the Vagina, with the sharp Transition zone being indicated by the sudden change in thickness of the Superficial Epithelium from Thin (Cervix) to very thick (Vagina) → Region A on Diagram
- The Cervix can be seen to have very narrow invaginations, which are Cervical Glands that are responsible for the production of Cervical Mucous
- The Cervical Stroma found just deep to the Epithelium is very lightly staining (in comparison to the Epithelium), containing Fibromuscular Tissue

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.37.20.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.37.20.png)

---

# Cervix Transformation Zone

- The Cervical Stroma is also highly vascular, with vessels identified by their lumen, surrounded by a layer of pink-orange staining smooth muscle
- 1 = Cornified Stratified Squamous Epithelium of Vagina
- 2 = Simple Columnar Epithelium of Cervix
- Transformation Zone is noted by sudden drastic increases in Thickness of the Epithelium, with the Stratified Squamous Epthelium sometimes containing tiny artefacts between the Epithelial Layers (which is not seen in the Cervical Epithelium)
- The Growth Factors and Regulatory Environment required to form and maintain the Simple Columnar Epithelium of the Cervix and the Stratified Squamous Epithelium of the Vagina are extremely different
- Therefore, alongside the presence of Carcinogens and HPV Infection, Signals from the Simple Cervical Epithelium can stimulate the Vaginal Epithelium, causing it to undergo Malignant Transformation to form a Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia
- The Basal Layer of the Stratified Squamous Epithelium stains much darker than the more superficial epithelial layers

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.37.50.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.37.50.png)

# Breast

- Production of colostrum and milk (nutrition of newborn).
- Comprised of Epithelial tissue that forms ducts and glands
- Connective tissue: intralobular, interlobular, blood vessels, nerves and lymphatics.

---

# Resting Breast (Non-Lactating)

- Glandular Lobules are found deep in the breast, with Ducts extending superficially from these Lobules to converge onto and open up onto the Nipple
- Strong, Dense Fibrous Connective tissue is found surrounding the Lobules and Ducts
- Resting breasts have few adipocytes, so there are strong fibrous tissue for support.

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.39.40.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.39.40.png)

- Lobules are identified by highly irregularly shaped and folded dark staining tissue, surrounded by an lighter pink-orange staining Dense Fibrous Connective Tissue
- As Lobules are highly convoluted, a plane Section through a Lobule will likely produce the appearance of various small circular dark-staining glandular tissue that are discontinuous with one another but tightly packed (these structures are actually continuous with one another but these connections are not found in the plane of section)
- The Ducts appear much larger than the Lobule and are irregularly shaped, identified by their large clear-staining lumen
- Some Adipocytes can be found embedded within the Fibrous Supporting tissue of the Breast but these are very sparse
- Lactating Glands are surrounded by an extremely light (lighter than surrounding Dense Fibrous Interlobular CT) and non-dense Fibrous Intralobular CT that contains few Collagen Fibres which holds the lobule together
- This Light Intralobular CT is not dense to allow it to be deformed when the Resting Lactating Glands are activated and expand during Pregnancy in preparation for active lactation
- At Rest, there is Little Glandular Tissue, surrounded by lots of Intralobular Loose CT

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.39.54.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.39.54.png)

---

# Breasts During Pregnancy

- Glands enlarge significantly and fill up the the spaces found between the layers within the non-dense Intralobular CT.
- This creates large regions of Densely Packed, Purple Staining Glandular Tissue surrounded by extremely light Intralobular CT
- Colostrum can sometimes be seen in the Duct via the presence of Bright Pink amorphous material along the inner walls of the Ducts
- Ducts are lined by a Simple Cuboidal Epithelium

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.40.30.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.40.30.png)

- Glands grow even more during lactation.
- This makes the breast appear dominated by Purple Glandular Tissue and Ducts, with thin Septa of Interlobular CT found running between lobules and supporting their structure
- Ducts are found between the Glandular Tissue and embedded within the Interlobular CT

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.41.08.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.41.08.png)

- Thin Interlobular CT Septa are found surrounding each lobule, which contains very little Intralobular CT between individual glands/ducts (Lobules appear full of densely packed Glandular Tissue with very little CT)

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.41.38.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.41.38.png)

- Connective tissue is squeezed into septae.
- The Epithelia of the Ducts appears organised into small folds within the Lumen
- Within the Intralobular Ducts of the Active/Lactating Glandular Tissue, the secretions found within the Lobule separate out into a Lighter Fat rich component and a Darker Proteinaceous component, found adjacent to one another

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.42.12.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.42.12.png)

# Functions of Male Reproductive System

- Continuous production, nourishment and short-term storage of spermatozoa.
- Introduction of fluid containing spermatozoa into female genital system.
- Synthesis of male sex hormones (androgens).

---

# Components of Male Reproductive System

- Testes: produce spermatozoa (male gametes) and male sex hormones (androgens).
- Ducts: Seminiferous Tubules → Rete Testes → 2 efferent ducts →  2 epididymis → 2 ductus (vas) deferens → 2 ejaculatory ducts → urethra.
- Glands:
1. Seminal vesicles (2) and prostate (1): secrete nutritive and lubricating fluid medium, seminal fluid in which spermatozoa are conveyed to female reproductive tract.
2. Bulbourethral glands of Cowper (2): secretes fluid which lubricates the urethra during ejaculation.
- Penis

# Testes

- Fibrous capsule (tunica albuginea): gives rise to fibrous septae that separate testes into 200+ lobules.
- Seminiferous tubules: tightly coiled into lobules of testes.
- Tubules lined by multilayer germinal epithelium.
- Each tubule is 0.1-0.2 mm diameter, up to 100 cm long.
- This is where spermatozoa are produced.
- Spermatogenesis (formation of spermatids) and spermiogenesis (maturation of spermatids to form spermatozoa) occurs in co-ordinated waves along each seminiferous tubule.
- Sertoli Cells rest on the basement membrane of the tubules and support the development of Spermatic Cells via complex cytoplasmic processes that are in contact with the other cells in the Germinal Epithelium
- Interstitial (Leydig) cells: found in spaces between tubules close to capillaries.
- Secrete androgens (mainly testosterone) in response to LH from pituitary.
- Local concentrations of androgens therefore very high in testes, with these high concentrations being necessary for Spermatogenesis and Spermiogenesis.

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.44.49.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.44.49.png)

- Comprised of convoluted, densely packed seminiferous tubules with Leydig cells found embedded in CT between these Tubules, which stain dark grey
- Within a section, Seminiferous Tubules appear as Disconnected/Separate Tubules found densely packed but in reality, they are all different sections of the Same Seminiferous Tubule but the connecting regions of Tubule are not found in the Plane of the Section

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.45.08.png](%5B040%5D%20Functional%20Histology%20of%20Reproduction%2091edd758c155454cb5156f3945e0e17d/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.45.08.png)

- [1] Leydig cells: producing testosterone.
- [2] Fibromuscular wall.
- [3] Sertoli cells: nourishes sperm during spermatogenesis.
- [4] Spermatogonia type B (up against wall)
- Spermatogonia are found adjacent to the basement membrane and Fibromuscular Contractile Capsule of the Semininferous Tubules
- Spermatogonia Type A having large, circular homogenous nuclei that stain dark
- Type B Spermatogonia undergo first meiotic division to become primary spermatocytes.
- Primary Spermatocytes can be identified as they are found more superficially in the Germinal Epithelium than Spermatogonia and have a large, circular yet heterogenous nucleus (comprised of small darker and lighter regions)
- Don’t see secondary spermatocytes very often as they are very short lived, rapidly undergoing the second Meiotic Division to form Spermatids.
- Spermatids have much smaller, condensed circular nuclei than Spermatogonia and Spermatocytes, found in the middle segment of  the Germinal Epithelium
- Spermatozoa are identified as they are smaller than other cells and have elongated and flattened nuclei, found near the Tubular Lumen of the Germinal Epithelium
- Sertoli Cells are found interspersed amongst the other Germinal Epithelium Cell types but are identified by their tiny, dense circular nuclei, surrounded by large amounts of Cytoplasm

# Gametogenesis

- Spermatogonia: type A and B. Primitive germ cells (present in small numbers before puberty). Multiply by mitosis to give continuous supply of cells for meiosis.
- Primary spermatocytes: first stage of meiotic division.
- Easy to see because process takes 3 weeks, resulting in secondary spermatocytes.
- Secondary spermatocytes: daughter cells of first meiotic division.
- Hard to see because they rapidly undergo second meiotic division to produce spermatids.
- Spermatids: which undergo 7-week maturation process (spermiogenesis) to produce spermatozoa.
- Spermatozoa: final stages of maturation take place in epididymis.

# Spermatozoa

- Acrosomal cap: vesicle containing
cocktail of enzymes (especially hyaluronidase) to break up Corona Radiata and dissolve zona pellucida for fertilisation.
- Nucleus: containing haploid number of chromosomes.
- Neck: Narrow region of the Spermatozoa that contains residual cytoplasm but few, if any organelle.
- Middle piece: first part of flagellum
(tail) containing usual ‘9+2’ arrangement of microtubules seen in cilia (axoneme) and 9 longitudinal coarse fibres and close-packed mitochondria.
- Principal piece: remainder of tail
containing ‘9+2’ microtubules and coarse fibres, tapering to end piece.

# Epidydymis and Vas Deferens

- Contraction of the Muscular Walls of the Seminiferous Tubules forces the Maturing Spermatozoa deep into the Testes to enter the Rete Testes (An Anastamosing network formed by the convergence of Seminiferous Tubules, found at the Testicular Hilum)
- The Rete Testes then feeds into Efference Ductules that combine to form the Epidydimis
- Epididymis: very long, convoluted duct leading from testes to vas deferens.
- Spermatozoa are stored here and mature as they move distally down the Epididymis (they also develop their motility here via the development of flagellae).
- Smooth muscle at distal end has sympathetic innervation and contracts during ejaculation.
- It is lined by Columnar epithelium with Microvilli.
- Vas (ductus) deferens: a thick walled smooth muscular tube that transports spermatozoa to urethra.
- It has sympathetic innervation and Intensely contracts during ejaculation.
- As you move distally down the Epididymis towards ductus deferens, the thickness of the Smooth Muscle Layer increases whilst that of Dense Fibrous CT Decreases.

- It can be distinguished from the Seminiferous Tubules due to the Simple Columnar with Microvilli Vs Stratified Epithelium
- Microvilli are involved in the absorption of excess water from the fluid that surrounds spermatozoa as they move along the Seminiferous Tubules

- Vas Deferens contains 3 thick layers of smooth muscle that allows it to powerfully contract during Ejaculation under SNS Stimulation, in synchrony with the Seminal Vesicles and Prostate to expel their contents into the Urethra
- Within the Urethra, the Bulbourethral/Cowper’s Gland produces Mucous Lubricant which is added to the secretions of the Vas Deferens, Seminal Vesicle and prostate to form the Mature Semen

# Prostate Gland

- Large gland surrounding bladder neck and first part of urethra.
- Glandular epithelium is irregular pseudostratified/columnar.
- Glandular units produce thin milky fluid that makes up ≤ 50% of seminal fluid volume.
- Enzymes in prostatic fluid (especially
fibrinolysin) liquify coagulated semen some time after ejaculation.
- Glandular units surrounded by supporting tissue which is a mixture of smooth muscle and fibrous tissue.
- Contracts in synchrony with other parts of genital tract to expel glandular
contents during ejaculation (sympathetic innervation).
- ↑ in size (hypertrophy) with age due to androgen stimulation.
- Growth of innermost part may constrict urethra, ↓ urinary outflow.
- Hypertrophy of outermost part may lead to malignant transformation.
- Prostate carcinoma is most common male malignancy (10% of men affected).
- Prostatic concretions: calcified lumps are indicative of Prostate Histology.
- These are common in lumen of glands, especially in older men.
- The Urethra that passes through the Urethra is surrounded by Prostatic Tissue that stains darker than the remainder of the Prostate
- This darker region of the Prostate surrounding the Urethra contains Ejaculatory Ducts (Have a very narrow lumen ) that transport the content of the Prostate Gland into the Urethra
- [A] Glandular tissue.
- [B] Prostatic urethra.

- Glandular Tissue of the Prostate appears irregularly and highly folded into the Lumen, surrounded by Fibromuscular Tissue which contains many blood vessels
- Glandular Epithelium appears Cuboidal/Columnar

# Seminal Vesicles

- Glands formed by long (15 cm) convoluted tubular outgrowths from ductus deferens.
- Responsible for ≥ 50% of volume of seminal fluid.
- Thick yellowish/white secretion containing fructose, proteins, amino acids, prostaglandins, citric and ascorbic acids.
- Thick smooth muscle wall contracts in synchrony with other parts of general tract to expel glandular contents during ejaculation (sympathetic innervation).

# Penis

- Contains 3 cylinders of erectile tissue:
1. 2 dorsal corpora cavernosa (In Superior Aspect of Penis).
2. 1 ventral corpus spongiosum (In Inferior Aspect of Penis).
- Erectile tissue contains large, irregular vascular channels, lined by endothelium, surrounded by fibrous tissue with some smooth muscle bundles.
- Sympathetic innervation stimulation causes partial closure of normal a-v shunt and diversion of blood from helicene arteries into cavernous spaces.
- Outflow of blood from the Penis is restricted because thin-walled veins are compressed, causing blood to pool within the Erectile Tissue to produce an Erection.
- Corpus spongiosum becomes somewhat less turgid, allowing urethra (which passes through the Corpus Spongiosum) to remain sufficiently open for passage of semen during ejaculation.
