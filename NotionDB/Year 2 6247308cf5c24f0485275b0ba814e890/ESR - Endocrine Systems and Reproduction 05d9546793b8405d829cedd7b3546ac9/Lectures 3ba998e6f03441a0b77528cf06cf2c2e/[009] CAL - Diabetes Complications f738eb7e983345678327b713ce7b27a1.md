# [009] CAL - Diabetes Complications

Progress: Not started

# General

- Type 1 Diabetes → Main Sign = Acute Weight Loss
- T2DM is usually detected in Routine Medical Checkups
- Some Px with T2DM may need to take Insulin as they require Extra Insulin than normal to maintain normal Insulin Signalling (E.g Insulin Requiring vs Insulin Dependent)

### Complications

1. Hyperglycaemia
2. Hypoglycamia - Can arise when too much Insulin is taken or when an Oral Hypoglycaemic Agent like Glibenclamide is taken
3. Non-Ketotic Hyperosmolar Coma - Arises when Extreme Hyperglycaemia occurs
4. Increased Incidence of UTIs and Yeast Infection
- Ketoacidosis is most common in T1DM and is rarely seen in T2DM as Hypoinsulinaemia (seen in T1DM, not T2DM) triggers Ketogenesis, which leads to Ketoacidosis

# Chronic Complications

- Neuropathies are divided into:
1. Autonomic Neuropathies - Damage to ANS (SNS and PSNS) Nerves supplying Glands and Viscera
2. Peripheral Neuropathies - Damage to Sensory Nerves arising from Hands and feet
- Autonomic (Mainly SNS) Neuropathy and Peripheral Retinopathy are common Long Term Complications of Poorly Managed Diabetes
- Chronic Complications of Poorly Managed Diabetes is believed to be due to microvascular damage due to Glycation of Vessels in the context of poor glycaemic control, leading to Basement Membrane Thickening and Endothelial Hyperplasia

# Autonomic Nervous System

- ANS Dysfunction:

# Drugs

- Metformin = Oral Biguanide Hypoglycaemic Agent that increases peripheral glucose uptake by increasing the efficiency of available insulin
- Humalog/nsulin Lispro = Fast Acting Insulin that is taken before or shortly after meals to lower blood [Glucose]
- Using Charts to calculate insulin requirements are easy for people who have trouble calculating doses but as they are generic/general, they are not specific to the rate at which an individual metabolises Insulin

# Other Organ Problems

### GI Issues

- Many Px with Diabetes Develop Gastroparesis due to Peripheral Neuropathy → This is reduced Gastric Emptying (Food remains in the stomach for longer than normal)
- This can lead to Bloating, Stomach Pains, Diarrhoea and/or constipation

### Renal

- Renal Function can be measured in Px with Diabetes by monitoring Urinary Albumin, Albumin:Creatinine Ratio and eGFR
- Albumin leaks into the Urine when the Ultrafiltraion Mechanisms when Renal Hypertension is seen and there is stress/high workload on the Ultrafiltraton System, meaning Urinary Albumin is a marker for the stress placed on the Ultrafiltration System

### Erections

- Erectile Dysfunction can be corrected by Viagra/Sildenafil, Injection Treatments, Vacuum Constriction Devices/VCD, Transurethral Therapy and Penile Implants
- Risk Factors for Erectile Dysfunction:

### Visual Complications

- Macula Impairment is common
- Macular Oedema = Fluid leaks into the Macula where central, high acuity vision occurs, causing swelling and Blurred vision here
- Proliferative Retinopathy = Fragile, abnormal blood vessels develop and leak blood into the Macula/Fovea, blurring vision

### Cellulitis

- Soft Tissue Infection (also affects Underlying Fat) that is associated with Diabetes and other conditions that weaken/disrupt the Immune system
- It is often bacterial but can be fungal in origin
- Diabetic Foot results in the greatest frequency of hospitalizations for those with Type 2 diabetes due to ulcers, infections and sometimes, Gangrene
- Charcot Joints - Peripheral Sensory Neuropathy (Light Touch and Proprioception Initially)
- Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy can cause Postural Hypotension due to SNS Dysfunction

# Neuropathy

1. Sensory Neuropathy - Most Important as protective sensation around joints can mean that microinjury is not detected and gets worse, leading to Ulceration or Diabetic Foot
2. Motor Neuropathy - This causes Muscle Atrophy (Retraction of Toes, Hammer Toes and Equinus → Limited Dorsiflexion)
3. Autonomic Neuropathy - Loss of Sweating (Associated with Charcot Foot as Dry Skin → Skin Fissures → Can Deteriorate when Sensory Neuropathy is present and lead to Diabetic Foot)
- Important to assess evidence of Peripheral Vascular Disease (Claudication, Check Pulse, Evidence of Ischaemic Foot) as if Px develops a wound and they have vascular disease, there will be poor wound healing, leading to wound progression and Diabetic Foot/Severe Ulceration
- Sx of Charcot Joint/Diabetic Foot = Loss of Sensation over joint, Pressure Would/Ulcer, Dry Skin, Flat Foot (Collapsed Arches)
- The Ability of the SNS to stimulate Sweating is commonly assessed by measuring a Decrease in Skin Conduction as Sweat contains Electrolytes (Ions like Na⁺ and Cl⁻) that increase the Conductance of the Skin

# Charcot Joints

- Charcot Joint Changes are best identified by X-Rays to identify bone changes in the Foot
- This is characterised by the 6Ds:
1. Debris
2. Deformities
3. Degeneration of Bone
4. Dense Bone
5. Destruction of Articular Cartilage
6. Dislocation

### Advice

- Check feet for tiny cuts and scratches before going to bed each night and check shoes before putting them on
- Proper footwear is critical to avoid pressure sores due to abnormal weight distribution on the foot (As the Feet Arches collapse)
