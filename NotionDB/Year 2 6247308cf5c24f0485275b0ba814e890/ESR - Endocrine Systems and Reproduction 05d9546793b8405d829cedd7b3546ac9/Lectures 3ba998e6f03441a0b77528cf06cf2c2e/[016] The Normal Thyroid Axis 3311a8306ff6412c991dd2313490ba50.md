# Anatomy of the Thyroid and Parathyroid Glands

### Thyroid

- 2 lateral lobes, joined by isthmus (pyramidal lobe joins top), 15-40g total weight.
- Situated below larynx.
- Anatomically related to trachea and oesophagus.
- Arterial supply: ECA and subclavian artery.
- Venous drainage: IJV and brachiocephalic vein.
- It is richly vascularised to allow for the delivery of large amounts of hormones from the Thyroid into the Blood Stream
- This means that during Thyroid Surgery, the Thyroid can bleed profusely and cause a large haemorrhage unless vessels supplying it are ligated
- Carotid Sheath is found posterior to the Lateral Lobes of the Thyroid
- Recurrent Laryngeal Nerves run up just posterolateral to the the Trachea and anteromedial to the Carotid Sheath, sandwiched between these
- Goitre (enlargement of thyroid gland) can push on trachea and recurrent laryngeal nerve.
- Surgery can damage recurrent laryngeal nerve
- Damage to both recurrent laryngeal nerves cause vocal cords to close leading to choking.

### Parathyroid

- 4 glands attached to posterior surface.
- Sense Ca²⁺
- Secrete PTH

# Morphology of the Thyroid Gland

- Organised as follicles, which are comprised of (Superficial to Deep):
1. Basement membrane
2. Follicular epithelial cell.
3. Deep pool of Colloid, surrounded by the Follicular Epithelial Cells
- In between follicles are C-cells (parafollicular cells) that secrete calcitonin.
- Capillaries supply blood to the thyroid gland and are found between the Follicular Epithelium and the Basement Membrane
- SNS Nerve endings innervate gland to control its function.
- Follicles are dynamic structures and can expand or contract, depending on activity.
- When the Thyroid is very active, Colloid is released at a high rate, causing Follicles to shrink (Small Colloid Pool)
- When the Thyroid is underactive, Colloid is released at a slow rate, causing Follicles to be larger due to a large colloid pool

# Embryological Abnormalities

- Thyroid originates from a pit found just between junction of anterior 2/3 and posterior 1/3rd of tongue.
- Thyroid is fully formed by Week 11-12
- Failure of gland to develop e.g. PAX8 (Specifies Thyroid) mutation causes congenital hypothyroidism.
- Migration of the Thyroid = Lingual → Retrosternal → Final Position in the Neck
- Cells can be left behind in this tract forming a lingual or retrosternal thyroid.
- Sometimes, Thyroid Tissue can be left and fail to migrate along with the rest of the Thyroid, found along the path of the Thyroglossal Duct → Lingual thyroid: left behind junction between anterior and posterior 2/3 of the tongue.
- Thyroglossal Cyst (Formed by failure of Thyroglossal Duct to atrophy) → Often found Inferior to the Hyoid by can be found above it and can be connected to the Thyroid by a Duct and often get infected (and hence, are often removed)
- Pyramidal lobe is formed by remnant of Thyroid Tissue just above isthmus, just before the thyroid reaches its final position

# Synthesis of Thyroid Hormones

- Thyroid makes 2 types of hormone:
1. Thyroid follicles: T4 (thyroxine) and T3
(triiodothyronine). Iodinated derivatives of tyrosine.
2. C-cells: Calcitonin.
- Calcitonin is a peptide hormone (Not AA Derived unlike TH) that antagonises PTH (↓ Ca²⁺).
- It is probably not significant in human Ca²⁺ metabolism.

---

# Thyroid is a Vascular Organ

- 4-6ml/min/g thyroid tissue (2 x that of kidney).
- High blood flow important for
1. Delivery of I⁻ and TSH to the thyroid.
2. Export of T3 and T4 into the circulation.
- Blood Flow through the Thyroid is responsible for audible bruit of overactive gland.
- Blood vessels divide into a net of capillaries surround each thyroid follicle so it is well vascularized.

---

# TSH

- NIS - Na⁺/I⁻ Symporter (Uniquely expressed on Thyroid Follicular Cells) → Couples I⁻ influx to that of Na⁺ to allow for I⁻ to enter the Follicular Cell
- Pendrin → Mediates I⁻ Efflux from the Follicular Cell into the Colloid Pool
- Pendrin Mutations → Pendred Syndrome (Congenital Hypothyroidism + Deafness)
- Thyroglobulin/Tg → Tyrosine-Rich Protein Scaffold upon which T3 and T4 is formed, exported into the Colloid Pool

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 18.32.02.png](%5B016%5D%20The%20Normal%20Thyroid%20Axis%203311a8306ff6412c991dd2313490ba50/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_18.32.02.png)

- TSH is produced by Thyrotropes of anterior pituitary gland.
- Activates TSH receptor (Gs-GPCR) on Basolateral Membrane of Follicular Cells, stimulating various processes:
1. ↑ DNA Synthesis → Increased Follicular Cell Proliferation
2. ↑ Protein Synthesis → Including Thyroglobulin
3. ↑ Iodine Influx into the Follicular Cell via NIS
4.  ↑ thyroid hormone synthesis
- ↑ iodination/organification of thyroglobulin
- ↑ microvilli number and length at luminal cell surface (Increase Transport across Luminal Membrane)
- ↑ in intracellular volume and endocytosis of colloid droplets
- Net result is ↑ thyroid hormone release

---

# Thyroid Hormone Raw Materials

### Tyrosines (Amino Acid)

- Glycoprotein scaffold called thyroglobulin (which is why we can stain as colloid.)
- Synthesized by thyroid epithelial cells and secreted into lumen of follicle.
- Colloid is a pool of thyroglobulin.
- 1 thyroglobulin = 134 tyrosine molecules.
- Only a handful of these are actually used to synthesize T4 and T3.

### I⁻

- Avidly taken up from blood by thyroid epithelial cells via Na⁺/I⁻ symporter (NIS) or "iodine pump”.
- Once inside cell, I⁻ is transported into lumen of follicle along with thyroglobulin via pendrin.

---

# Thyroid Peroxidase

- Synthesises thyroid hormones.
- An integral membrane protein in apical (colloid-facing) membrane of thyroid epithelial cells.
- 2 sequential reactions:
1. Organification: iodination of Phenol Groups of tyrosines on thyroglobulin . Oxidiser is H₂O₂ (Generated by Dual Oxidase, using O₂ and NADPH)
- Addition of 2I⁻ forms DIT (di-iodoTyr)
- Addition of I⁻ iodide forms MIT (monoiodoTyr)
1. Coupling: synthesis of T4 or T3 from 2 iodotyrosines by transferring the Iodinised Phenol Ring of one Iodotyrosine to another. Oxidiser is H₂O₂.
- DIT + DIT = T4 (4 iodine atoms → 2 on inner ring and 2 on outer ring).
- DIT + MIT = T3 (3 iodine atoms → 2 on Inner Ring and 1 on Outer Ring).
- Inner Ring is closer to Amino Acid residue and Outer Ring is further away from Amino Acid
- At this point, T3/4 are still stuck to thyroglobulin inside colloid.
- Thyroid hormones accumulate in colloid.
- Hormones need to be liberated from the scaffold and secreted as a free hormone into the blood.
- Thryoglobulin is endocytosed into the Follicular Cell across its Luminal/Apical Surface
- Within the Endosome, the Thyroglobulin-TH Complex is cleaved to free TH
- TH then diffuses out of the Basolateral Membrane of the Follicular Cell to enter the Capillaries and Blood Stream
- In a Px with No Iodine Deficiency, Much more T4 is produced than T3 as T4 is the Prohormone for T3
- Uncoupled DIT and MIT is recycled back into the Thyroid Peroxidase System to form more T4 and T3
- Thyroid hormone can be stored in a pool which can be released later

![Screenshot 2022-01-26 at 18.32.02.png](%5B016%5D%20The%20Normal%20Thyroid%20Axis%203311a8306ff6412c991dd2313490ba50/Screenshot_2022-01-26_at_18.32.02.png)

### Summary

- Thyroid relies on blood supply.
- Binds TSH to cell, and binds to TSH receptor. Imports Na⁺ and I⁻ into cell via NIS.
- I⁻ is exported into lumen of follicle via pendrin.
- Thyroglobulin is secreted into colloid pool.
- First phase involves organification using I⁻ to form DIT and MIT (catalysed by thyroid peroxidase and H₂O₂).
- Second phase involves coupling (catalysed by thyroid peroxidase and 𝐻₂O₂) to stick 2 tyrosine rings together (T4 or T3, which is still stuck to thyroglobulin).
- T4 and T3 are removed from thyroglobulin via lysosomes, and then T4 and T3 are released into blood.
- Remaining MIT and DIT are recycled into system, to recycle I⁻.

### EM Autograph of Bat Thyroid - Post I-131 Injection

- By Injecting Radioisotopes of Iodine into a Bat, these Radioisotopes can be influxed via NIS and incorporated into Thyroglobulin to radiolabel them
- This can be used to visualise Thyroglobulin Degredation in the Follicular Cell to allow for TH Release

# Thyroid Hormones in Circulation

- Hypothalamus produces TRH which stimulates TSH release from the Anterior Pituitary Gland
- Secretion of T3/T4 is stimulated by TSH (dimeric glycoprotein hormone).
- T3/T4 is involved in a -ve Feedback loop where it inhibits the Hypothalamus and Pituitary to reduce TRH and TSH Production to reduce T3/T4 production to keep [T3/T4] constant
- Normal range of TSH: 0.3 – 4.5 mU/L.
- Normal total concentrations:
- Total T4: 60 – 150 nmol/L.
- Total T3: 1.2 – 2.9 nmol/L.

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 12.32.35.png](%5B016%5D%20The%20Normal%20Thyroid%20Axis%203311a8306ff6412c991dd2313490ba50/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_12.32.35.png)

# T3/T4 Transport in the Blood

- Total TH Levels = Free TH + Bound TH
- Many hormones are bound to proteins in blood which are not filtered out of the blood in the Kidneys to prevent filtration of the Hormone in kidney across the Glomeruli.
- 99.9% bound to 3 different proteins:
1. Thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) (75%): binds both T3 and T4 despite its name.
2. Transthyreitin (20%)
3. Albumin (5%)
- Only 0.1% is free: This is measured clinically.
1. Free T4: 9-22 pmol/L.
2. Free T3: 3-6 pmol/L.
- It is free thyroid hormone that can diffuse into cells and produce its effects
- Thyroid hormone bounds to proteins cannot diffuse into cells and hence, cannot act on the cell.

---

# Physiological Actions

- Multiple tissue targets:
- T3 is the bioactive form of TH and T4 is the prohormone
- This provides an additional step of regulation of the HPT Axis, namely the production of the active hormone from the Prohormone
- ↑ basal metabolism (release of energy from various sources to maintaining body temperature).
- Promote growth and development (with GH).
- Increase Cardiac Work (with Catecholamines):
1. +ve chronotropy
2. +ve inotropy
- CNS:
1. Regulates alertness (with Cortisol)
2. Development of foetal brain during the 1st Trimester.
- Modulates actions of other hormones:
1. Insulin: antagonistic as thyroid hormone considered a catabolic hormone.
2. Adrenaline (synergistic): ↑ lipolysis, glycogenolysis, ↑ HR.
3. GHRH: ↓ secretion (-ve feedback to regulate Growth Rate).
4. TRH: ↓ secretion from Hypothalamus and release (-ve feedback to maintain [TH]). 
- TRH is released by hypothalamus to secrete TSH.

# T4 is a Prohormone For T3

- T4 and T3 are actively transported through transporters like MCT8 which can also import AAs.
- Inside the Cell, T4 deiodinated to T3 by Deiodinase D1/D2.
1. D1/D2 removes iodine outer rings.
2. DIO D3 removes iodine from inner ring.
- This converts T4 into rT3 (Reverse T3) which is inactive and converts T3 into T2 which is inactive.
- D1/2 convert rT3 into T2, which is inactive
- Deiodination is an intracellular regulated step to allow the Target Cell to further regulate the level of T3 (TH Signalling) within the Cell (Not just dependent on [TH] in the Blood for activity) by controlling the rate at which T4 is converted into T3 within the cell
- Brown Adipose Tissue is found in greater quantity in infants than adults (adults mainly have BAT after cold acclimation) → BAT is controlled by the SNS, which regulates DIO1/2 to regulate the rate at which T4 is converted into T3 within the Cell and hence, the rate of Thermogenesis

# Thyroid Hormone Receptors (TR)

- Part of the family of nuclear receptors.
- Member of steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily.
- TR binds to TR response element (TREs) on DNA.
- As TRE are palindromic, they can bind TR when resting as a monomer, TR as a Homodimer  or most commonly, TR:RXR Heterodimer
- RXR and T3 are bound to the TRE at rest and when T3 binds to THR, it heterodimerises with RXR, and activates core activators which recruits and activates RNA Polymerase II, leading to transcription and translation into proteins.
- As Generation of New Proteins via Transcription and Translation takes time (Vs Activation of Already present molecule), They are long acting and slow onset/offset

# Control of Transcription

- Active repression: When there is no T3 bound, RXR and TR are still bound to TRE but TR recruits core repressors which recruit HDAC to make chromatin more compact by deacetylating histones (inactivating DNA).
- Active transcription: when T3 is bound, heterodimer recruits core activators which makes contact with RNA Polymerase II and its basic transcription factors (E.g TBP), activating RNA Polymerase to trigger gene expression
- Permissive transcription: There is no RXR or TR yet Gene Transcription can still occur (at a lower rate than that seen when RXR-TR heterodimer is bound) as Core Activators are still bound to RNA Polymerase, allowing it to be active at a low level

# Types of Thyroid Receptors

- 2 genes: TR𝛼 and TR𝛽
- Each gene can be alternatively spliced by spliceosome, which is also tissue specific, to produce 2 isomers.
- TR𝛽 is responsible for responsiveness to TH in the Hypothalamus and Pituitary via -ve feedback
- TR𝛼 is important/expressed more in the Heart, Intestines, Bone and Liver than TR𝛼
- TR𝛽 is expressed more in the Liver than TR𝛼
- Mutation in TR𝛽 causes reduces responsiveness of Hypothalamus and Pituitary Gland to TH, which prevents -ve feedback (leads to hyperthyroidism/Raised T3 and T4 as there is disinhibition of TSH Secretion).

# T3 on Mitochondria

- TR can be found in the Nucleus where it controls Nuclear DNA but it can also be expressed in the Mitochondria where it regulates Mitochondrial DNA
- T3 regulates mitochondrial DNA to ↑ energy metabolism.
- Effect of T3 on the Nuclear Gene Expression is important for mitochondrial metabolism as many proteins found within the Mitochondria are encoded in the Nuclear Genome

# Metabolic Effects of TH

- Body temperature: controls temperature, BP and HR.
- Leptin stimulates TRH and TSH to increase TH production so that metabolism increases.
- TH increases Lipolysis in WAT and Thermogenesis in BAT directly and indirectly by activating the SNS
- Stimulates FA and Bile Acid Synthesis in the Liver
- Stimulates Muscle regeneration and Repair
- It is involved in 𝛽 Cell maturation
