# [036 & 038]  Hormonal Control of Reproduction 1 & 2

Progress: Not started

# Phases of Puberty

- Adrenarche: early sexual maturation in higher primates that in humans typically occurs at 5-18 years of age.
- During adrenarche, adrenal cortex secretes ↑ levels of androgens (e.g. DHEA and DHEAS) but without ↑ cortisol levels.
- Adrenarche is result of development of new zone of adrenal cortex (zone reticularis).
- Menarche: first menstrual cycle in females.
- Fecundity: reproductive rate of an organism.

# Fertility Through Life

- Start of fertility (puberty).
- End of fertility (menopause).
- Inhibiting fertility (contraception).
- ↑ fertility (treatment of infertility).

### Growth Rates

- The adolescent growth can be divided into 3 stages:
1. Minimum growth velocity (or ‘age at take-off’ → Age at which growth velocity begins to increase significantly)
2. Peak height velocity (PHV)
3. Decreased growth velocity and epiphyseal fusion to reach final adult height
- Fastest growth occurs in the first 2 years of life and declines beyond this until the Age at Take Off
- Boys begin growth spurt about 2y
later than girls but the rate of growth between men and women is similar
- As the Age of Take Off is later for men than women, this means that men are taller at take-off and reach PHV later than women (longer period of pre-pubertal growth).
- There is a height gain of boys (28cm) and girls (25cm) between take-off and
cessation of growth
- 10cm difference in adult height
between men/women due to the
height difference at take-off

### Puberty

- In humans, onset of puberty is considerably delayed postnatally when compared with other mammals.
- Puberty involves gonadarche in all mammals and adrenarche in
great apes and humans, due to activation and production of Gonadal and Adrenal Sex Steroids respectively.
- Gonadal Secretion is rather high in utero to establish functional Gonadal Steroid production but decreases to low levels until Puberty, when it begins to increase
- During Adult Life, there are large fluctuations in Gonadal Secretion of Sex Steroids, with a base rate that is greater than that seen pre-puberty
- Physical changes include sexually dimorphic growth differences and differences in lean muscle and fat mass.
- Secondary sexual characteristics (those not seen at birth) develop at puberty under influence of ↑ levels of gonadal steroids.
- Adrenal androgens stimulate appearance of pubic and axillary hair.
- ↑ in secretion of GnRH, gonadotrophins and gonadal steroids occur during activation/beginning of puberty.
- One of first endocrine changes to occur is ↑ in gonadotrophin secretion at night.
- Lesions in CNS can be associated with advanced or delayed puberty but are difficult to interpret mechanistically.
- There is a predictable trend towards an earlier age of onset of puberty over time.
- This predictable trend is primarily linked to attainment of a critical body weight to commence Gonadal Steroid Synthesis at progressively earlier ages during last century.
- Hence, attainment of critical body fat content/weight seems to be a key trigger to onset of puberty to allow puberty to occur but is not the sole trigger/cause.
- Endocrine markers of body weight such as leptin are implicated in onset of puberty but are unlikely to be causally
involved as its trigger.

---

# Body Weight and Puberty

- The attainment of a body size sufficient to cope with pregnancy (some 50,000 kcal) is a logical signal for puberty
- Yet obesity in girls advances puberty, in boys it delays it.
- As Adipocytes produce a wide range of hormones (Including Oestrogen), these may play a role in the Induction of Puberty but there is not one key hormone that is responsible for activating Puberty
- A number of hormones have been investigated for their involvement in the activation of puberty
- Mutations in Leptin Gene increases food intake and lowers body temperature, leading to obesity.
- Leptin deficient mice are infertile, a feature reversed by treatment with leptin, with leptin involved in Long vs Short Term Weight/Energy Store regulation.
- Leptin Deficiency is very rare in Humans, mainly seen in Consanguineous Families, caused by Autosomal Recessive Mutations

---

# Hormonal Activation of Puberty

- Of the hormones investigated for a possible role in initiating puberty; leptin, has been implicated the most
- Leptin levels rise during puberty, and patients with mutations in the leptin gene or receptor fail to enter puberty as reduced leptin signalling reduces GnRH Release
- Failure of Puberty can be overcome by treatment with leptin
- However, leptin is unable to initiate puberty precociously so it is not the only signal triggering puberty
- Thus, leptin may provide some form of permissive or background presence that is essential for triggering the GnRH Signal and its effects, alongside hormones such as kisspeptin 1, the expression of which is down-regulated under conditions of negative energy balance

---

# Pubertal Hormones

- Pituitary gonadotrophins drives the changes in gonadal steroid activity, the key effectors of puberty
- During the childhood and juvenile stages
gonadotrophin output remains very low in both sexes
- Initially most gonadotrophin (LH and FSH) secretion occurs during sleep
- Puberty - pulses of LH and FSH become evident, and levels rise gradually to reach adult levels where LH and FSH Pulses dampen to a higher base level

# Human Life Cycle

- We are born physically and sexually immature.
- Then spend first decade of our life growing and maturing.
- At adolescence, mature sexually at puberty and soon achieve capacity to produce fertile eggs or sperm and, in women, to carry a pregnancy.
- This reproductive capacity (or fecundity), then characterises much of our adult life.
- However, there are distinct differences between men and women in their life-time fecundity patterns.
- Male fecundity: once achieved, persists throughout life, albeit slowly tapering downwards with ↑ age.
- Female fecundity: is time limited, declining steeply from about 35 years until ending at menopause at around age 50 years.

---

# Age of Menarche

- Worldwide, girls have been reaching puberty at earlier ages due to an interaction between a lifestyle factor and a pre-existing genetic predisposition.
- Lifestyle factors: girls eating more, exercising less and accumulating more body fat.
- Because fatty tissue is a significant source of oestrogen, an ↑ percentage of body fat tends to speed-up puberty in young girls.

---

# Adrenarche

- A distinctive pattern of hormonal changes underlies puberty.
- Rise in adrenal androgens is first indication (i.e. dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEAS).
- This ↑ is called adrenarche and occurs only in great apes and humans and spans years 8-15 of age (just before Puberty).
- Its significance for puberty is unclear but is associated yet not necessary for puberty to begin.
- It occurs up to 2 years before Menarche (First Period)
- Adipose Tissue is a significant source of Oestrogen and hence, Increasing Body Fat tends to speed-up puberty in girls to allow Menarche to occur earlier

---

# Menarche

- Culmination of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty, including:
1. Sufficient body mass is required for menses/periods to start (typically 17-22%).
2. Disinhibition of GnRH pulse generator in arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus to increase the activity of the HPG Axis.
3. Secretion of oestrogen by ovaries in response to pituitary hormones, which sensitises the response to the effects of Various HP Axes (Notably GH/HPS Axis).
- Over a 2-3-year period of time (around Menarche), oestrogens stimulate:
1. Growth of uterus.
2. Height/body growth.
3. ↑ adipose tissue, usually around the hips.
4. Widening of pelvis.
5. Breast growth
6. Growth and vascularity of endometrium and uterine lining to allow for reproductive capacity.

---

# Menarche and Fertility

- No specific hormonal signals for menarche is known.
- In most girls, menarche does not signal that ovulation has occurred and hence, is an unreliable marker of ovulation.
- In post-menarchal girls, about 80% of cycles are anovulatory (not associated with ovulation) in 1st year after menarche, 50% in 3rd and 10% in 6th year.
- Regular ovulation is usually indicated by predictable and consistent intervals between menses, predictable and consistent durations of menses and predictable and consistent patterns of
flow (e.g. heaviness or cramping).
- Continuing ovulation typically requires > 22% body fat.
- However, some girls ovulate before first menstruation.
- Although unlikely, it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant.

# Female and Male Development

### Female Development

- First ovulation not until age 15.
- Menarche not until 10-16.
- Breast development not complete until late teens but occurs over a similar period to Pubic Hair Development.
- Pubic hair not complete until late teens but begins before menarche

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.03.11.png](%5B036%20&%20038%5D%20Hormonal%20Control%20of%20Reproduction%201%20&%202%2078b7c9969a2c4ab693c79e0282ee7f16/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.03.11.png)

### Male Development

- Spermatogenesis can start from 10-17 years of age and continues throughout adult life.
- Penis and testis development
begins around 10-11 until late teens.
- Pubic hair development can
begin from 10 until early 20s.

# Male Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Gonadal Axis

- GnRH is synthesized in parvocellular neurons within hypothalamus
and travels down to anterior pituitary where it stimulates gonadotrophs (in
anterior pituitary) to synthesise and secrete LH and FSH.
- FSH stimulates Sertoli cells in the Seminiferous Tubules of the testes, which then secrete androgen binding protein and inhibin.
- ABP binds to Testosterone and helps maintain ↑ testosterone concentration in
seminiferous tubules to stimulate
spermatogenesis (particularly the final stages).
- Inhibin works via -ve feedback to inhibit further release of FSH whilst Testosterone works via -ve feedback to inhibit further release of LH and GnRH → This ensures that the rate of Spermatogenesis needed for the Male Reproductive System is maintained
- LH stimulates Leydig cells between seminiferous tubules in testis, which then secrete testosterone.
- Testosterone also acts on Sertoli cells to ↑ ABP secretion, and may also be converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to stimulate Androgen Receptors or converted by Aromatase into Oestradiol to stimulate Oestrogen Receptors.
- Both testosterone and DHT (most active form of 61 testosterone) are responsible for male pattern of development prenatally (essential for spermatogenesis), enlargement of male sex organs and expression of secondary
sexual characteristics (at puberty), as well as protein anabolism in adult life.
- In the Foetus, Testosterone masculinise the reproductive tracts
- Testosterone also works through -ve feedback to inhibit further release of LH.
- Testosterone levels are highest in morning (10-30mmol/L).

# Spermatogenesis

- Leydig Cells are found between seminiferous tubules
- Sertoli Cells are found lining the outer surface of the Seminiferous Tubules with Spermatogonia found embedded within the Sertoli Cells
- Seminiferous Tubules are highly coiled within the surface area, allowing for a large SA to allow for a high rate of Sperm and Hormone production

![Screenshot 2022-02-05 at 23.30.47.png](%5B036%20&%20038%5D%20Hormonal%20Control%20of%20Reproduction%201%20&%202%2078b7c9969a2c4ab693c79e0282ee7f16/Screenshot_2022-02-05_at_23.30.47.png)

- Spermatogonia (2n) are precursor
cells found closest to basement
membrane of seminiferous tubules.
- Spermatogonia A differentiate into
spermatogonia B, which then
undergo mitosis (to maintain Male Fecundity) and then when stimulated to undergo meiosis, they undergo differentiation to form primary spermatocytes (2n) whilst migrating towards through the Seminiferous Tubules towards its lumen.
- Primary spermatocytes then undergo
meiosis I to form secondary spermatocytes (n), which then undergo meiosis II to form spermatids (n).
- Spermatids are all linked to one another by a cytoplasmic bridge, found closely associated to surrounding Sertoli Cells.
- Spermatids then go through process of spermiogenesis to form spermatozoa (n), which reside in lumen of seminiferous tubule.
- In humans, process of spermatogenesis takes 65-75 days.
- Around 300 million sperm complete the process of spermatogenesis each day.

# Female Sexual Reproduction

- Precursor cell in female is oogonium (2n).
- These Oogonia proliferate In Utero and partially go through meiosis I to form primary oocytes (2n) before birth, held in this state until puberty.
- At puberty, primary oocytes complete meiosis I, which leads to the production of secondary oocytes (n) and first polar body (n) via asymmetric divisions
- The Polar Body is formed to remove half of the DNA from the Egg Cell but is very small (little cytoplasm) in order to maintain the size of the Egg Cell
- First polar body may, or may not, divide again.
- Secondary oocyte begins meiosis II but is held at metaphase II until fertilization.
- During ovulation both secondary oocyte and first polar body are ovulated.
- If fertilization occurs, secondary oocyte completes meiosis II, oocyte then splits into ovum (n) and second polar body (n).
- Nuclei of the sperm and ovum unite to form diploid zygote (2n).
- Primary oocyte is held at prophase I.
- Secondary oocyte is held at metaphase II  until fertilised by sperm.

# Follicular Development and Ovarian Cycle

- At beginning of a menstrual cycle, level of GnRH slowly ↑, which causes ↑ secretion of LH and FSH from the gonadotrophs in anterior pituitary.
- FSH travels to ovaries, where it promotes
follicular growth via proliferation of Granulosa Cells, which also causes them to get smaller in size each time.
- It is ↑ follicular growth that promotes oestrogen production, which prepares the Uterine Lining for Implantation.
- Small ↑ in oestrogen levels inhibits LH and FSH release from anterior pituitary but causes its accumulation within the cells to prevent premature ovulation.
- Oestrodiol upregulates GnRH-Rs and progesterone downregulates GnRH-Rs.
- FSH continues to develop follicles as they develop from primordial follicles to primary and then secondary follicles.
- One secondary follicle will usually dominate, and this develops into a mature Graafian follicle.
- Within the Secondary Follicle, a Fluid-Filled Space, which enlarges to surround the Oocyte, which remains connected to the inner wall of the Mature/Graafian Follicle via a thin stalk of Granulosa Cells (Cumulus Oophorous)
- At same time more and more oestrogen is being secreted as the follicle is maturing.
- Eventually oestrogen levels peak and stimulates a surge of GnRH and LH release, indicating that the follicles are matured sufficiently for release.
- LH surge causes ovulation, where the Secondary oocyte, surrounded by Corona Radiata (Granulosa Cells that form the Cumulus Oophorus), is discharged from follicle and released into fallopian tube.
- LH Surge is a rapidly inhibited to allow for the Ovulation of only a Single Secondary Oocyte
- LH surge also ↓ oestrogen secretion by follicle, it also stimulates granulosa/theca cells, left within the follicle following ovulation, to differentiate into luteal cells, which then forms corpus luteum
- Degeneration/involution of Graafian follicle ↓ oestrogen secretion to avoid another LH surge.
- Corpus luteum secretes both progesterone and oestrogen.
- Progesterone is required to maintain lining of uterus in preparation for fertilization and pregnancy.
- Both oestrogen and progesterone negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit LH and of FSH release;
- Only oestrogen -ve feedbacks to hypothalamus to inhibit GnRH release.
- As levels of FSH and LH ↓, corpus luteum degenerates and forms corpus albicans over a period of 10-14 days.
- At this stage oestrogen and progesterone levels ↓ and if the Ovum is not fertilised, this causes the lining of uterus breaks down (menstruation).
- There is then ↓ -ve feedback on hypothalamus and pituitary so cycle starts again.
- If the Ovum is fertilised, The corpus luteum will be supported by hormones from the placenta and will not degenerate until the end of pregnancy so that Progesterone Secretion and hence, the Endometrial Lining are maintained throughout pregnancy.
- Corpus luteum also secretes inhibin (reduces FSH secretion) and relaxin (↓ uterine smooth muscle contraction and ↑ flexibility of the pubic symphysis).
- Signal required to activate a single primary follicle is unknown but it is known that group of Primary Follicles will develop but usually, only one will mature to form a Graafian Follicle

# Ovarian Cycle

- Phases: menstruation → follicular → luteal.
- First half of cycle can
vary in its length, however, second half
of cycle (postovulation) is fixed to
14 days.
- Ovulation generally occurs at
around day 14 (postmenstruation).
- Oestrogen +ve feedback on GnRH, to cause more FSH and LH (LH surge) which causes rupturing and release of oocyte.

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.12.21.png](%5B036%20&%20038%5D%20Hormonal%20Control%20of%20Reproduction%201%20&%202%2078b7c9969a2c4ab693c79e0282ee7f16/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.12.21.png)

# Menstrual Cycle

- Ovarian and uterine cycle occur simultaneously, generating right environment, that if fertilisation occurs, there is an environment for future zygote to implant and survive.
- Follicular stage: corpus luteum maintains hormone production and ↑ progesterone and oestrogen production, causing ↑ secretory phase of uterine lining.
- Menstrual stage: menstruation is first stage of cycle and lasts for 3-5 day.
- During this phase, Progesterone and Oestrogen are low during Menses, with GnRH Pulses becoming more frequent, causing FSH and LH Levels to rise and stimulate the development of Primary Follicles
- Proliferative phase with ongoing LH and FSH being produced, stimulating increased Oestrogen Production from the Maturing Follicles, which stimulates Endometrial Proliferation and growth
- Rising Oestrogen levels (from the Maturing Follicles) stimulates more frequent GnRH Pulses, increasing FSH and LH secretion whilst Primary Oocytes undergo Meiosis to form Secondary Oocytes
- Layers get thicker, and ovulation occurs
around day 14 of cycle.
- Secretory phase is where progesterone
and oestrogen maintain the endometrium to allow for implantation to occur.
- High levels of Progesterone and Oestrogen and Synthesis by the Corpus Luteum inhibit GnRH Release whilst Inhibin from the Corpus Luteum inhibits LH and FSH Production.
- These both act to prevent additional follicular development whilst the Ovarian Cycle is occurring for an individual Follicle.
- Failure of fertilised embryo to be produced and implant means corpus luteum stops producing progesterone and oestrogen, so hormones ↓ and menstruation occurs, stimulating increased GnRH Secretion by the Hypothalamus to allow for the cycle to start again.

![Screenshot 2022-02-04 at 12.13.28.png](%5B036%20&%20038%5D%20Hormonal%20Control%20of%20Reproduction%201%20&%202%2078b7c9969a2c4ab693c79e0282ee7f16/Screenshot_2022-02-04_at_12.13.28.png)

- Menstration Phase = Day 1-5
- Proliferative/Follicular Phase = Day 5-14
- Secretory/Luteal Phase = 14-28
- During the Menstration Phase, most of the Gonadal Hormones are at very low levels
- In the Proliferative/Follicular Phase, There is a rapid increase in LH just before Day 14 (Ovulation) and a gradual increase in Oestrogen and small FSH Peak to produce Very High Levels of LH and High levels of Oestrogen (Lower than LH Levels) and a Small increase in FSH
- In the Secretory/Luteal Phase, there are very high levels of Progesterone, with Moderately high Oestrogen Levels (Lower than that seen in Proliferative Phase as Sex Hormone Levels drop significantly after Ovulation, whilst Progesterone Levels increase during this time)
- At the end of the Luteal Phase, Progesterone Levels drop to allow GnRH Secretion to increase to start the cycle again
