# [011] Hydrophilic Hormones and Enzyme Cascades

Progress: Not started

# Hydrophilic Hormones

- Proteins (e.g. insulin), peptides, or amino acid derivatives (e.g. adrenaline).
- Can dissolve in plasma without needing transport by binding proteins, although there are exceptions (about half of
catecholamines are loosely bound to plasma albumin).
- Hormones act by altering intracellular proteins, because hydrophilic hormones can't cross plasma membrane, they act by binding to receptors on outer plasma membrane surface of target cell.
- Binding of hormone to receptor causes an ↑ in concentration of 'second messenger' in cell, which alters activity of other proteins
- Hormone = Primary Messenger

# Types of Hormones and Hormone Receptors

### Types of Hormones

- Hormones can be classified according to distance over which they act:
1. Endocrine - Act on cells far form site of release. Secreted into blood where all/many cells are exposed to the Hormone. 
- Only target cells express the specific hormone receptor to ensure that only cells that express the receptor respond to the hormone, producing a specific and localised response (E.g. insulin and adrenaline).
1. Paracrine - Act on nearby cells only. They diffuse in interstitial fluid and are rapidly inactivated by local enzymes to prevent widespread diffusion of the hormone (e.g. histamine).
2. Juxtacrine - Hormone is either bound to membrane (requires physical contact between cells) or hormone is secreted
into extracellular matrix (only stimulate cells that are 1/2 cells away from the Secretory cell).
3. Autocrine: Act on cell that released hormone (e.g. T cells and IL2).
- Some cells can act in multiple types of hormone signalling

### Types of Hormone Receptors

**Features of Hormone Receptors:**

1. Binding site faces outside of cell.
2. Cytosolic domain is affected by binding to extracellular binding site.
3. Contains a membrane-spanning portion to connect extracellular binding site to intracellular cytosolic domain that changes conformation when hormone binds to extracellular binding domain, with this conformation change being relayed onto the Cytosolic Domain.

| Receptor | Example | Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ligand Gated Ion Channel | ACh Receptor | Signal is transduced to the cell via a change in Vm when the ion channel is opened |
| Receptor Enzymes | Insulin Receptor | Enzymatic activity of Cytosolic Domain of the receptor is activated by hormone binding |
| Enzyme Recruiting Receptor | Cytokine Receptor | Hormone binding induces recruitment and activation of Protein kinases |
| GPCR | Adrenaline Receptor | Hormone binding activates GTP Binding proteins |

# Generalised Signal Transduction

1. Hormone is released. Hormone may enter bloodstream in order to reach targets all over body, or may only be released into tissue fluid, to reach nearby cells.
2. Hormone binds to receptor on plasma membrane of cell. Hormone binding induces a conformational change in receptor's cytosolic region that alters its function.
3. Concentration of a second messenger ↑ through enzymatic action.
4. Effectors are stimulated or inhibited by second messenger. These may be pumps, enzymes or gene transcription factors, for example.
5. Signalling pathway is shut down. Effectors return to original state, and messengers are removed or become ineffective (E.g Enzymatic Degradation of Hormone, Internalisation and Metabolism of Hormone-Receptor Complex etc.).

# GPCRs

- Largest class of cell-surface receptors, there are several thousand known.
- Widely used as drug targets.
- Involved in responses to hormones, neurotransmitters, odours, tastes, and light
- 7 Transmembrane Helices/Domains, with an Extracellular N-Terminus and Intracellular C-Terminus
- They contain Cytosolic Loops between Domains 3-4 and 5-6 which can change conformation when the Hormone Binds, allowing them to interact with the G-Protein
- α and γ Subunits of G Protein is bound to the Inner Surface of the Plasma Membrane via Covalently Bound FAs

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 16.57.35.png](%5B011%5D%20Hydrophilic%20Hormones%20and%20Enzyme%20Cascades%20c985bbb35c1c4e5595f5767c305508ff/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_16.57.35.png)

- Hormone-bound receptor causes the G Protein to exchange of GDP for GTP, activating 𝐺𝛼 subunit and causing it to dissociate from the βγ Subunit.
- Dissociated 𝐺𝛼 subunit then interacts with an enzyme, until it hydrolyses GTP to GDP, becoming inactive again (takes seconds to minutes).
- Gα subunits (x20) can be divided into 4 groups:
1. 𝐺𝑠 (𝐺𝛼𝑠): activates adenylyl cyclase, ↑ [cAMP].
2. 𝐺𝑖 (𝐺𝛼𝑖): inhibits adenylyl cyclase, ↓ [cAMP].
3. 𝐺𝑞 (𝐺𝛼𝑞): activates phospholipase C, ↑ [DAG], [IP3] and [Ca²⁺].
4. 𝐺𝑡 : activates retinal cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase.
- There are 5 𝐺𝛽 and 6 𝐺𝑌 isoforms.
- Tissues regulate their expression of these 𝛽𝛾 subunits.
- 𝐺𝛽𝛾 complexes may alter the specificity of Receptor:G-protein binding (which Receptor the 𝐺𝛼 subunits can interact with), co-operate in signal transduction, or shut the pathway down.

# 𝜷-Adrenergic Receptor

1. In absence of adrenaline, G-protein is bound to GDP, effector protein, PKA and AC is inactive.
2. When adrenaline binds to receptor, it causes a conformation change to the 3/4 and 5/6 cytosolic loops.
3. These interact with G-protein to catalyse the removal GDP and binding of GTP (GDP Exchange).
4. G𝛼 subunit with GTP bound to it can bind to AC which is activated and converts ATP to cAMP
5. PKA which is a heterotetramer with 2 regulator subunits (which are bound together) and 2 catalytic subunits. Regulatory subunits stop PKA from phosphorylating.
6. 4 cAMP binds to the 2 regulatory subunits and cause the release of the catalytic subunits which phosphorylate effector proteins to alter their activity.
- Enzymes involved in Enzyme catalysed steps (GDP Exchange by Receptor, AC and cAMP) can catalyse multiple reactions before being inactivated and speed up the rate of these reactions, causing amplification at each step which speeds up the rate of reaction which allows a small amount of adrenaline to have a large effect on the body.

# Activation of Heterotrimeric G-Proteins

- Switch II is part of the G𝛼 subunit.
- It can form an 𝛼 helix which can interact with other proteins.
- When GDP is bound to 𝐺𝛼, Switch II can only be formed if there is a Gβγ Subunit for Gα to bind to
- Extra phosphate on GTP stabilises switch II in the Gα (Slightly different conformation to that seen when bound to Gβγ) in the absence of the Gβγ Subunit, which allows it to activates adenylyl cyclase.
- When GTP is hydrolysed, switch II is disordered and unable to form until the G𝛼 Subunit interacts with Gβγ.
- Overactive adenylyl cyclase (As Cholera Toxin inhibits GTPase activity of 𝐺𝛼 and hence, its inactivation) in enterocytes of intestine is responsible for water diarrhoea.

# Protein Kinase A

- Protein kinase A, an R₂C₂ heterotetramer,
is a serine/threonine kinase.
- It recognises the consensus sequence (target): Arg,Arg,X,Ser/Thr,Z.
- All Kinases and Phosphatases have Consensus sequences
- This means it only phosphorylates serine/threonine if they sit within this consensus sequence.
- Regulatory subunits have sequence: Arg,Arg,Gly,Ala,Ile.
- As this is very similar but not identical to the consensus sequence, this means catalytic subunit binds to regulatory subunits but won’t
phosphorylate it.
- Binding of 4 x cAMP to 2 R subunits causes them to dissociate from catalytic subunits, activating them.
- Protein kinase A phosphorylates several enzymes, such as hormone-sensitive lipase (+), acetyl CoA carboxylase (-), glycogen synthase (-), and transcription factor CREB (+) → These are metabolic enzymes that all contain the consensus sequence
- Protein kinase A is thus able to immediately alter metabolic pathways, and have longer term effects via gene transcription alterations.

# Diverse Effects and Points of Amplification

### Diverse Effects

- In different cell types, different hormones can stimulate cAMP pathway, and activated PKA will have different target proteins due to different organs expressing different protein target isoforms or localising proteins in different places.
- Liver (adrenaline, noradrenaline, glucagon): ↑ glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.
- Adipose tissue (adrenaline, ACTH): ↑ lipolysis.
- Ovarian follicles (FSH, LH): ↑ synthesis of oestrogen and progesterone.

### Points of Amplification

- Adrenaline:receptor complex is able to catalyse GDP:GTP exchange on multiple G-proteins. Each activated G𝛼 subunit can only bind to 1 adenylyl cyclase.
- Each active adenylyl cyclase can catalyse formation of many molecules of cAMP.
- It takes 4 molecules of cAMP to activate 2 x PKA subunits.
- Each active PKA subunit can phosphorylate many proteins.

---

# Receptor Enzymes

- These receptors have an extracellular ligand-binding domain, and an enzyme active site on intracellular section, connected by a single transmembrane segment.
- Many of these enzymes are tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (e.g. insulin receptor).
- There are also some with serine/threonine kinase activity.
- Another group have guanylyl cyclase activity (convert GTP to cGMP).
- In these receptors, ligand binding either activates enzymatic activity, or alters the receptor’s conformation to bring it in proximity to its target.

---

# Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs)

- Receptor tyrosine kinases functions as dimers, with an extracellular hormone-binding domain, and an intracellular
protein tyrosine kinase domain.
- Most RTKs travel around as a monomer, dimerising when the ligand binds to become active
- Upon binding of hormone (many are  growth factors), RTK monomers cross-phosphorylate each other and dimerise.
- Phosphorylation of RTK makes it a site of attachment/binding site for proteins with SH2 domains, or PTB domains (localising proteins at membrane to increase the probability of collision/reaction).
- For insulin receptor, it is found as a dimer when its ligand isn’t present, with ligand binding leading to cross phosphorylation which causes the kinase to become fully active.

---

# Epidermal Growth Factor : MAPK Pathway

1. Binding of EGF to each EGFR monomer induces a conformation change that allows monomers to dimerize. 
- The close proximity of the cytosolic domains allows these 2 Monomers to cross-phosphorylate each other and dimerise to create binding sites. Initially RTK was active, but not in close proximity to function.
1. Tyrosine-phosphates act as binding sites for Grb-2 (attaches with its SH2 Domain), which is attached to Sos.
2. Sos catalyses exchange of GDP for GTP on membrane-bound Ras, activating it.
3. GTP:Ras binds to and activates Raf, a membrane-bound protein kinase.
4. A cascade of protein kinases (Usually MAPKs) are phosphorylated and activated, resulting in phosphorylation of several transcription factors, altering their activity.
- MAPK: mitogen activated protein kinase

![Screenshot 2022-01-20 at 17.15.53.png](%5B011%5D%20Hydrophilic%20Hormones%20and%20Enzyme%20Cascades%20c985bbb35c1c4e5595f5767c305508ff/Screenshot_2022-01-20_at_17.15.53.png)

# Sos and Ras

- Sos is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF).
- It catalyses exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras protein. But only when it has been recruited to membrane via Grb-2.
- Ras is a small G-protein. Unlike heterotrimeric G-proteins, Ras is monomeric.
- Ras also has a slower GTPase activity (0.02 per min vs ~ 3 per min) than heterotrimeric G-proteins meaning they are activated for a longer period than heterotrimeric G Proteins.
- GTPase activity can be ↑ ~ 105 -fold by GAPs (GTPase activating proteins) to alter their duration of activity.
- Ras:GTP binds to, and activates, Raf.

---

# ESR Signalling and Cancer

- EGFR is overexpressed in some epithelial cancers.
- RTK Monomers are active but cannot bind ligand as the monomer is unable to dimerise, leading to no cross-phorylation and hence, no phosphorylated binding sites
- In this case, a small amount of receptor can dimerize in absence of ligand as they are expressed in a high [ ] on the membrane (and hence, can be found near each other).
- Since tyrosine kinase activity is already present, this is enough to initiate signal transduction, thereby sending an inappropriate 'grow and divide' signal to cell.
- A therapeutic antibody (cetuximab)  targets extracellular domain of receptor, sterically blocking ability of receptor to dimerise.
- This has been successfully used in colorectal cancers

---

# Insulin Receptor Signalling

1. Binding of insulin to dimeric receptor forces PTK (protein tyrosine kinase) domains together, followed by cross-phosphorylation.
2. First round of cross-phosphorylation fully activates kinase activity, and is followed by more cross-phosphorylation which creates binding sites.
3. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues act as binding sites for membrane bound IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1), which gets phosphorylated.
4. Phosphorylated IRS-1 can bind PI-3K (phosphoinositide-3 kinase), which, now located at membrane, phosphorylates PIP2 at position 3, forming PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5 trisphosphate).
5. PIP3 allows both PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1) and PKB (protein kinase B) to associate with membrane via their PH (pleckstrin homology) domains.
6. Phosphorylated PKB dissociates from membrane and phosphorylates its target proteins.
- This is responsible for GLUT4 translocation

---

# Insulin Receptor Substrate 1

- Insulin receptor substrate-1 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues
- IRS-1 is already associated with membrane due to its PH domain, which can bind PIP2.
- Once phosphorylated, it can dissociate from insulin receptor to bind PI-3K.
- IRS-1 is a docking protein, as it can bind many proteins, including Grb-2 (thereby activating MAPK pathway).
- There are other proteins that can assemble at phosphorylated insulin receptor, including IRS-2, a homologous protein.
- Insulin is therefore capable of simultaneously stimulating numerous pathways, involving short-term and long-term effects.

# Transforming Growth Factor (TGF𝜷) and Its Receptor

### (TGF𝜷)

- TGF-β family is a large family of proteins involved in regulating development.
- These signalling proteins normally prevent proliferation of most mammalian cells by inducing synthesis of proteins that inhibit cell cycle and may induce differentiation.
- Most mammalian cells secrete at least 1 TGF-β isoform, and have receptors on their surface.
- Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP7) induces bone formation in cultured cells and is now used clinically to strengthen bone fractures.
- TGF-β proteins also play a role in tissue organisation, promoting expression of extracellular matrix proteins and adhesion molecules

### Receptor

- The receptor is comprised of 2 Dimers which are separated from one another when a Ligand is not bound but bind to each other when the Ligand is present
1. TGF-β binds to TBR-II, whose serine/threonine kinase activity is continuously active.
2. This allows it to bind to TBR-I, and phosphorylate its glycine-serine rich (GS) domain, activating S/T kinase activity.
3. TBR-I can then phosphorylate a class of transcription factors called R-Smads.
4. Upon phosphorylation, 2 R-Smads and a Co-Smad form a heterotrimer, and 3 nuclear localisation signals are also exposed.
5. In nucleus, heterotrimer interacts with transcription factors to cause expression of particular target genes
- Hormones without secondary messengers are normally for longterm effects

# TGF-𝜷 Receptor and Cancer

- TGF-β receptor pathway often inhibits growth in cells.
- Loss of either TBRI or TBRII function due to inactivating mutations is found in many human tumours.
- These tumours are resistant to growth inhibition by TGF-β.
- Mutations in Smad proteins also prevent TGF-β signalling, most human pancreatic cancers contain a deletion in Smad4 (a CoSmad).

---

# Cytokine Receptors

- Family of small (~160 AAs) signalling molecules, with a characteristic arrangement of four 𝛼 helices, controlling growth and differentiation of a number of cells.
- Cytokine receptors do not have an intrinsic enzyme activity, rather they recruit an enzyme.
- Receptors all have a tyrosine kinase called JAK bound to their cytosolic domains, which phosphorylate transcription members of Signal Transduction and Activation of Transcription (STAT) family.
- Although cytokine receptors can activate other pathways (e.g. MAPK pathway), JAK/STAT pathway is only activated by cytokines

---

# Erythropoietin

- Cytokine released by kidney in response to low 𝑂₂.
- Stimulates transcription of genes in erythroid progenitors that prevent them from undergoing apoptosis and stimulate them to differentiate into erythrocytes (RBCs).
- Use of supplemental erythropoietin to ↑ level of erythrocytes in blood is banned in international athletic competitions.
- Use of supplemental erythropoietin is also dangerous, as surplus
erythrocytes can clot small blood vessels. Several athletes have
died of stroke during exercise due to erythropoietin doping.

---

# Erythropoietin Receptor

1. Dimeric JAK2 kinase with low activity is bound to cytosolic domain of EpoR.
2. Epo simultaneously binds 2 EpoRs, bringing JAK kinases close enough for each to phosphorylate the 'activation lip' of other. 
- This lowers Km of kinase for its substrate, activating it.
1. JAK kinases phosphorylate receptors allow STAT5 to bind (via SH2 domains), and also get phosphorylated.
2. Phosphorylated STAT5s dissociate from receptor, dimerise, exposing a nuclear localisation sequence.
3. STAT5 dimer enters nucleus and its DNA-binding domain binds to specific DNA regulatory sequences to control expression of target genes

---

# Switching Off the JAK/STAT Pathway

- SHP1 is a phosphotyrosine phosphatase, that binds phosphorylated receptor and dephosphorylates JAK kinase, inhibiting pathway when cytokines are no longer binding to receptor.
- A mutant version of erythropoietin receptor was discovered in an athlete that caused them to have higher levels of RBCs than normal, despite unusually low levels of erythropoietin (because
receptor wouldn’t turn off properly).
- This mutant receptor was missing some of tyrosine normally phosphorylated during signal transduction.
- Receptor was able to bind and activate STAT5, but was unable to bind SHP1 phosphatase, resulting in ↑ intracellular signalling in erythroid progenitor cells, and more RBCs than usual (Reduced Inhibition of JAK/STAT Pathway with Low [Erythropoetin]).

# Summary

- Hydrophilic hormones must bind to receptors in plasma membrane in order to change behaviour of proteins inside cell.
- Hormones can have a range of effects on different tissues, by stimulating different pathways, or acting on different targets.
- Pathways generally act by changing location, activity or concentration of proteins.
- Dysregulation of these pathways can have serious negative effects, such as cancer or insulin resistance, or sometimes positive ones.
- PI-3K-PKB Pathway Dysfunction leads to Insulin Resistance
