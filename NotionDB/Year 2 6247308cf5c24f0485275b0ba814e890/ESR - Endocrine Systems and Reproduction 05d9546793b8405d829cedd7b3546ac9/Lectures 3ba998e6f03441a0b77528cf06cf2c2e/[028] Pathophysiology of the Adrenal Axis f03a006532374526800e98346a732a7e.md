# [028] Pathophysiology of the Adrenal Axis

Progress: Anki In Progress

# Stress

- Although -ve feedback from cortisol, higher brain centres stimulate the Hypothalamus to ↑ production of CRH, so HPA axis remains active.

# Increased ACTH Drive

- Chronic stress: ↑ CRH.
- Glucocorticoid resistance: Leads to loss of -ve feedback via Cortisol, leading to increased ACTH.
- CRH-independent secretion of ACTH from pituitary (corticotroph) tumour (Cause of Cushing’s Disease).
- Ectopic ACTH secretion: from small cell  carcinoma of the lung.
- Genetic or Acquired Defects in cortisol synthesis: CAH or Addison’s disease.

---

# Cushing’s Disease or Syndrome

- Cushing’s disease: ↑ cortisol due to pituitary tumour.
- Cushing’s syndrome: ↑ cortisol action not due to a pituitary tumour:
    1. Chronic stress
    2. Ectopic ACTH secretion.
    3. Functional Zona Fasciculata tumour.
1. Not glucocorticoid resistance (as they would have high Glucocorticoid Levels but low levels of Glucocorticoid activity)
    - Iatrogenic Cushing’s: caused by excess free plasma glucocorticoids over a long period of time.
    - Symptoms: moon face, bruising, central adiposity, supra-clavicular fat pads.
    - Same Sx as Cushing’s Syndrome but there is no hirsutism: only giving glucocorticoids and not excess ACTH.
    - This means that Steroidogenesis within the Adrenal Cortex is not stimulated so there is not an excess production of DHEA being produced

---

# Cushing’s Syndrome

### Causes

- Prolonged or excess exposure to cortisol can also result from:
    1. Long-term use of corticosteroid hormones such as cortisone or prednisone.
    2. A tumour or abnormality of adrenal gland, which causes body to produce excess cortisol.
    3. Ectopic Tumours of lungs, thyroid, pancreas or thymus gland, which can, in rare instances, produce hormones that
    trigger syndrome.

### Symptoms

- Weight gain of upper body and trunk.
- Skin changes including darkening of skin, easy bruising and purple stretch marks/striae.
- Excess hair growth or acne in women.
- Menstrual disorders, especially infrequent or absent periods.
- Fatigue and muscle weakness due to muscle catabolism.
- Personality changes or mood swings.
- As DHEA is a significant androgen in women but not in men (Due to potency and large quantity of Gonadal Steroids), Increased DHEA Production due to Raised Cortisol produces masculinising effects on women but not on men

---

# Diagnosis of Cushing’s Syndrome

### Late-Night Salivary Cortisol

- One of most sensitive diagnostic testing for Cushing’s syndrome.
- ↑ cortisol between 23:00-00:00 is earliest detectable abnormality.
- Cortisol usually very low at this time, but in Cushing’s syndrome, value is usually elevated as circadian rhythm of Cortisol levels is lost.
- It is most widely studied single test for diagnosis, with a sensitivity of 93-100% for diagnosis, however, many things (E.g Chronic Stress) may cause a false +ve result, thus additional testing is always needed.

### Urine Free Cortisol

- 24-hour urine free cortisol level reflects cortisol secretion throughout day.
- Majority of Cushing’s have elevated levels of urine free cortisol, but mild Cushing’s syndrome can have normal
levels.
- 20-25% of Cushing’s syndrome may have a normal urine cortisol.
- Thus, a normal 24-hour urine free cortisol does not exclude diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome.
- Other conditions can ↑ urine free cortisol including depression, chronic alcoholism, and eating disorders.

### Low-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test

- Testing has been used for 40 years as a diagnostic tool in evaluation of patients with suspected Cushing’s syndrome.
- Dexamethasone is a synthetic steroid that should suppress cortisol production in normal subjects to a very low level by suppressing the entire HPA Axis by acting on the Hypothalamus, Anterior Pituitary Gland and Adrenal Gland.
- If Px has a ACTH-producing Pituitary Tumour, ACTH and Cortisol would be raised and CRH may be low via Negative Feedback
- Dexamethosone adminsitration here lowers ACTH and Cortisol (to still detectable levels) and raised CRH by suppressing the Tumour (As Tumour is Corticotroph derived and hence, expresses Glucocorticoid Receptor)
- If Px has an Ectopic ACTH producing tumour, ACTH and Cortisol are raised whilst CRH is low due to negative feedback
- Dexamethosone administration has little effect on suppressing the Tumour as it is not derived from Corticotrophs and hence, does not express Glucocorticoid Receptors that allow Dexamethosone to inhibit Endogenous ACTH Synthesis via Negative Feedback → ACTH and Cortisol are still raised (Px is non-responsive to test)
- If Px has Adrenal Tumour, there will be raised Cortisol but lower CRH and ACTH due to Negative Feedback Effect of Cortisol
- If a Dexamethosone is given, ACTH remains low but there is little impact on Cortisol Levels as Cortisol Production by the tumour is often not driven by ACTH and hence, not influenced by higher aspects of the HPA Axis
- Currently, most widely used test is administration of a small dose of
dexamethasone (1 mg) at 23:00 followed by a measurement of serum cortisol early following morning.
- This is preferred screening test in patients with suspected Cushing’s from a primary adrenal gland disorder.

---

# Differential Diagnostic Testing

- Once diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome has been established, its cause must be identified.
- Majority of patients with Cushing’s syndrome have an ACTH-secreting tumour usually from pituitary gland (Cushing’s disease) or a non-pituitary tumour (ectopic ACTH syndrome).
- Some patients may have Cushing’s syndrome due to a solitary or multiple tumour in their adrenal glands secreting
excessive cortisol.
- ACTH testing: first step in distinguishing type of Cushing’s syndrome is a blood test for measurement of ACTH obtained in morning.
- Patient with ACTH-secreting tumours will either have a normal or elevated level of ACTH.
- In contrast, patients with adrenal Cushing’s will have a subnormal level.
- CT of adrenal glands: in patients with low ACTH levels, problem is usually in adrenal gland.
- CT scanning of adrenals identified
whether there is a solitary or multiple cortisol-producing adrenal tumour resulting in cortisol excess.
- MRI of pituitary gland: to distinguish pituitary from non-pituitary ACTH-secreting tumours.
- Majority have a pituitary lesion (often
very small), a MRI of pituitary gland with gadolinium enhancement is initial approach.
- When a pituitary tumour is identified, referral is for surgical removal.
- However, 10% of population have incidental pituitary tumours on MRI which are often asymptomatic.
- Thus 10-15% of patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome may also have an
abnormal pituitary gland MRI due to silent pituitary tumours.
- Inferior petrosal sinus sampling: for patients with an ACTH-secreting tumour causing Cushing’s syndrome and a normal pituitary MRI.
- This procedure requires a skilled invasive radiologist who can sample blood from veins (inferior petrosal sinuses) that
drains the pituitary gland.
- A catheter can be placed in both of these veins at same time (To identify if Tumour is Uni or Bilateral) and blood sampled for ACTH before and after
administration of CRH (which stimulates ACTH )
- CRH administration increase the accuracy of the test by increasing the magnitude of the difference between the Petrosal and Peripheral ACTH Levels in Px with Cushing’s Disease (Pituitary Dependent), there is an exaggerated ACTH response which is not seen in Px with Ectopic ACTH Syndrome
- Inferior Petrosal levels of ACTH are then compared with that in the periphery so that If Petrosal > Peripheral, Pituitary is source of ACTH but if Peripheral > Petrosal, Ectopic Source of ACTH is present
- This has excellent diagnostic accuracy and will reliably establish presence or absence of an ACTH-secreting pituitary tumour.

### Diagnostic Profile

1. Peripheral ACTH Levels
2. If ACTH is low → Primary Adrenal Disorder (as Pituitary Negative Feedback is intact E.g Cushing’s Syndrome)
3. If ACTH is High → Cushing’s Disease due to no negative Feedback
4. If Px has high ACTH, Pituitary MRI to identify Pituitary Tumour, followed by Inferior Petrosal Sinus Venous Sampling to determine whether tumour is actively secreting ACTH or not
5. Using a High Vs Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression test or CRH when carrying out Petrosal Venous Sampling can be used to Dx smaller adenomas that may be producing ACTH
6. If Petrosal ACTH is not raised, Wider body CT or MRI (Usually Lung) can be used to Diagnose Ectopic ACTH Tumour

# ACTH Results

- Low ACTH and High Cortisol in Cushing’s Syndrome → Due to normal Negative Feedback suppression of ACTH by raised Cortisol produced by Ectopic Source
- High ACTH and High Cortisol in Cushing’s Disease → ACTH Producing Pituitary Tumour increases ACTH levels which increases Cortisol levels
- It is often difficult to differentiate biochemically between Cushing’s Disease and Ectopic ACTH tumours as they both have a similar Adrenal Hormone profile

# Treatment

- For Cushing’s syndrome, surgery directed at pituitary or adrenal glands is first and most important treatment,
- However, many patients do not have a sustained remission after surgery.
- A number of drugs originally designed to treat other conditions have been used to treat Cushing’s syndrome:
1. Ketoconazole: used for fungal infections. Is most commonly used medication in this group. 
    - 50-75% of individuals with Cushing’s syndrome who are treated have their cortisol levels normalised.
    - However, effectiveness is limited by side-effects including liver damage.
2. Mitotane: medication primarily used in adrenal cancer, is also used to ↓ cortisol levels. 
    - Like ketoconazole, mitotane blocks production of cortisol, but in higher
    doses, it may also cause destruction of adrenal cells.
    - Studies show it is effective in > 80% patients, but nearly as many patients have side effects that can be significant.
3. Metyrapone: Inhibits Cortisol synthesis but 1 in 5 individuals have side effects such as ↑ facial hair growth in women, swelling, ↓ K⁺ levels and
dizziness due to increased Aldosterone and DHEA Synthesis (As Reduced Cortisol Synthesis redirects substrates and enzymes to other steroidogenic pathways)
4. Mifepristone: works differently than other medications as it blocks action of cortisol in body, rather than ↓ amount of cortisol that is made. 
    - 60% of patients have improvements in blood glucose and 80-90% have
    improvement of physical features
    - Contraindications in pregnancy.
5. Cabergoline: can be used in Cushing’s disease. 
    - A medication mainly used for treatment of prolactin secreting pituitary tumours, but it has been shown to normalise cortisol levels in 20-40% of patients with Cushing’s disease due to common origin for Corticotrophs and Lactotrophs meaning that they express similar receptors.
    - Unfortunately, effects tend to wear off over time and cortisol levels ↑ despite continued treatment.
    - Pasireotide is a Somatostatin Receptor Antagonist that binds to Somatostatin Receptor 5 and lowers cortisol in most and normalizes cortisol levels in about 25% of patients.
    - The major side effect of pasireotide is increased blood sugars.
    - 40% of patients had increased blood sugars and ~1:5 develop diabetes.

# Defects in Adrenal Steroidogenesis

### Causes of Hypocortisolaemia

- Impaired steroidogenesis (CAH or Addison’s Disease).
- ↓ ACTH drive:
1. ↓ hypothalamic CRH drive.
2. ↓ pituitary ACTH output.
3. ACTH resistance due to receptor mutations

### Addison’s Disease (Reduced Synthesis of Adrenal Corticosteroids)

- This is characterised by Reduced Cortisol (and Aldosterone) and most commonly presents in 30-50 years
- In the UK, Addison's disease most often occurs due to autoimmune destruction of the Adrenal Cortex (70-90% of cases)
- Early-Stage Symptoms are depressive or flu-like (Fatigue, Muscle Weakness Low Mood, Loss of Appetite, Unintentional Weight Loss, Increased Thirst)
- Over time, Symptoms develop so that Px presents with Dizziness, Fainting, Cramps, Exhaustion, Hyperpigmentation (Notably in Mouth) and Hypovolaemia
- It can also form when adrenal glands are harmed by:
1. Infections, such as tuberculosis, HIV, and or bacterial or fungal infections.
- Iatrogenic Addison’s disease can also form if you take a steroid medication for a long time and then suddenly stop using it due to steroids suppressing endogenous Cortisol and Aldosterone Production, which cannot recover to normal levels once steroids are withdrawn.
- Treatment involves replacing glucocorticoids.

---

# Adrenal Crisis

- Life-threatening complications of adrenal insufficiency due to low cortisol
- 5-10 crises/100 patient years
- A medical emergency, if left untreated, it can be fatal and hence, Px with Addison’s Disease and defects in Cortisol levels will wear a Steroid Alert Bracelet incase an Adrenal Crisis presents
- Responsible for increased morbidity and excess mortality experienced by patients with adrenal insufficiency (>50%)
- Treatment involves urgent administration of IV/IM hydrocortisone and IV fluids
- Patient education regarding preventive measures against Adrenal Crisis is viral, i.e. "stress dosing" when sick (Increasing Steroid Dosage when ill to allow the body to cope with increased metabolic stress in illness), parenteral hydrocortisone as necessary and seeking medical assistance promptly
- Most commonly occurs following an infection, (gastroenteritis)
- Even with patient education adrenal crises are high risk.

---

# Addison’s Disease and Hyperpigmentation

- Producing CRH, which produces
ACTH, which should be stimulating cortisol production.
- Because of autoimmune destruction of adrenal gland, cortisol is not produced by the action of ACTH and hence, there is no negative feedback inhibition of CRH and ACTH, causing CRH and ACTH levels to continuously increase.
- Brain and pituitary produce more CRH and more ACTH due to this lack of Cortisol Negative Feedback, so more by-product of POMC cleavage, so ↑ secretion of 𝛼-MSH to stimulate ↑ activity of melanocytes in skin

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 10.15.38.png](%5B028%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20the%20Adrenal%20Axis%20f03a006532374526800e98346a732a7e/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_10.15.38.png)

---

# Glucocorticoid Resistance and Hyperpigmentation

- Despite Normal Cortisol Levels, Lack of Glucocorticoid response leads to the loss of -ve feedback for release of CRH
and ACTH by Cortisol. Therefore, these are produced in excess.
- There will be more by-products of POMC cleavage, including 𝛼-MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone).

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 10.16.35.png](%5B028%5D%20Pathophysiology%20of%20the%20Adrenal%20Axis%20f03a006532374526800e98346a732a7e/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_10.16.35.png)

# Differentiating Between Defect in ACTH Drive to Adrenal Cortex and Addison’s Disease

- Addison’s disease: all adrenal steroids suppressed.
- ACTH defect: only ACTH-dependent steroids are ↓.
- Therefore:
1. [Aldosterone] unaltered by ACTH defect
2. [Aldosterone] ↓ in Addison’s disease (polyuria; polydipsia; ↑ Na⁺ intake)

---

# Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

- CAH is characterized by ↓ synthesis of adrenal corticosteroids as a result of loss of function mutations and ↓ expression of adrenal steroidogenic enzymes.
- There is little or no synthesis of cortisol or precursors corticosterone and, as a result, no -ve feedback. It is ↑ ACTH levels that cause hyperplasia of adrenal glands.
- DHEA secretion is ↑ in CAH due to ↑ ACTH drive thus causing associated symptoms of pseudohermaphroditism in women.

---

# Salt-Wasting Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

- This is commonly due to mutation in P450C21, which normally converts progesterone to deoxycorticosterone to prevent aldosterone synthesis in the Zona Glomerulosa and 17-α-Hydroxy-progesterone to 11-Deoxycortisol in the Zona Fasciculata to prevent Cortisol production.
- There is Na⁺ loss due to insufficient synthesis of aldosterone.
- This lack of Cortisol prevents Negative Feedback Control of ACTH by Cortisol, causing ACTH levels to rise.
- This leads to increased Synthesis of Aldosterone and Cortisol precursors like Pregnenolone which can be redirected to Androgen Synthesis in the Zona Reticulata to increase the synthesis of Adrenal Androgens such as DHEA
- With a 21-hydroxylase defect, you can still make progesterone and DHEA, but you cannot make aldosterone, cortisol or
mineralocorticoids.
- Because you cannot make these, there is impaired reuptake of Na⁺ in kidney, so wastage of salt.

### Summary

- Individuals have mutation in 21 hydroxylase enzyme.
- Can’t make aldosterone and cortisol, so salt wasting because of lack of aldosterone action.
- Lack of cortisol means there is little -ve
feedback, so ↑ ACTH, driving rate limiting enzyme (CSCC).
- This produces all precursors, so producing excess adrenal androgens.
- Adrenals get larger because ACTH promotes production, to try and produce cortisol.

# Salt-Sparing Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

- Also known as Simple Virilising CAH due to Excess mineralocorticoid stimulation of Na⁺ resorption leading to malignant hypertension.
- Result of a deficiency in P450C11B1, this
prevents cortisol and aldosterone synthesis but not deoxycorticosterone synthesis.
- DOC is less effective than aldosterone, but because there is a loss of -ve feedback via Cortisol and Aldosterone, meaning there is Increased ACTH, leading to excess DOC being produced due to increased activity of P450 Cholesterol Side Chain Cleavage, which means you can retain Na⁺ via Mineralocorticoid Activity.
- Normal Feedback via RAAS does not control DOC Production, leading to uncontrolled Na⁺ and hence, water retention
- This Uncontrolled Na⁺ fluid balance causes malignant hypertension.
- This is virilising, because there is more
production of androgens due to high level of ACTH, causing excessive DHEA production.

### Summary

- Individuals have mutation in 11𝛽 hydroxylase enzyme.
- Milder phenotype, because they can produce DOC (deoxycorticosterone).
- This is a weak mineralocorticoid, so acts
like aldosterone.
- Individuals still cannot make cortisol.
- ACTH levels are ↑, driving rate-limiting enzyme (CSCC), so DOC is out of
control.
- Normal fluid balance is through aldosterone, but since there is too much DOC, there is salt-sparing.
- There is still  large adrenal glands due to excess of adrenal androgens.

# Why Must Px be Weaned Off Glucocorticoids?

- Exogenous glucocorticoids: (e.g. dexamethasone, prednisolone) suppress The HPA Axis to lower CRH/ACTH levels.
- Adrenal cortex atrophies due to lack of activity/endogenous steroidogenesis
- This presents the risk of iatrogenic Addison’s syndrome, which can lead to Adrenal Crises.
- Wean off over 3-6-month period to allow the Adrenal Cortex to recover function and undergo hyperplasia to allow for sufficient Steroidogenesis in the absence of the exogenous Glucocorticoids.

---

# Conn’s Syndrome

- Conn’s Syndrome = Primary Hyperaldosteronism
- Primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism are conditions in which adrenal gland releases too much of hormone aldosterone.
- In secondary hyperaldosteronism, excess aldosterone is caused by something outside adrenal gland that mimics primary condition by driving aldosterone synthesis (usually by factors that increase Bp).
- Primary hyperaldosteronism used to be considered a rare condition, but some experts believe that it may be cause of ↑ BP in some patients.
- Most cases of primary hyperaldosteronism are caused by a benign tumour of the Zona Glomerulosa.
- Secondary hyperaldosteronism is generally related to ↑ BP.
- It is also related to disorders such as: cirrhosis of liver, heart failure, over-activity of renin-angiotensin system (i.e. a renin producing tumour).

### Symptoms

- Fatigue and headache (due to Hypertension)
- Hypertension
- Intermittent paralysis
- Muscle weakness due to alteration in electrolyte balance
- Numbness: changes in electrolyte balance of circulation.

### Signs and Tests

- Abdominal CT will show an adrenal mass, usually unilateral
- ECG shows heart rhythm abnormalities due to low K⁺ levels which reduces the ability of the heart to repolarise, producing small, flattened T Waves.
- Elevated plasma and urinary aldosterone.
- Low plasma renin activity due to negative feedback on the RAAS via Aldosterone.
- Hypokalaemia and Hypernatraemia

### Diagnosis

- Conn’s syndrome is associated with ↑ secretion of aldosterone by adrenal glands.
- Conn’s occurs when there is a unilateral adenoma (benign tumour) of adrenal gland, causing hyperaldosteronism.
- Dx is usually made by identification of Adrenal Mass on Abdominal CT following Dx of Primary Aldosteronism via Plasma Aldosterone and Electrolyte Levels
- If Adrenal Tumour cannot be identified, Dexamethosone Suppression Test can be carried out with sampling from Adrenal Veins to confirm Adrenal Aldosterone-Secreting Mass
- Rx is often Adrenalectomy of the Adrenal Mass if Tumour is located unilaterally
- When both adrenal glands are making too much aldosterone, condition is called bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.
- Most cases occur in people between 30 50 years of age
- This can be managed via Medication vs Bilateral Adrenalectomy to not significantly impair Adrenal Hormone Synthesis and Negative Feedback inhibition of other Hypothalamo-Pituitary Endocrine Axes
- E.g Spironolactone acts as an anti-androgen, Aldosterone Antagonist and Mild K+-Sparing Diuretic

### Treatment

- Patients are generally referred for adrenalectomy after an abdominal CT reveals an adrenal mass.
- This is done via laparoscopic adrenalectomy instead of a large open surgery, where most patients are now able to go home day after surgery instead of staying in hospital for 3-7 days.
- Laparoscopic Adrenalectomy uses 3-4 small incisions and allow for a rapid recovery for work

### Bilateral Adrenalectomy

- Previously, identification of a pituitary adenoma was more difficult, and therefore patients underwent removal of adrenal glands in order to lower blood levels of cortisol.
- Because pituitary tumour was not removed, the tumour enlarged due to raised ACTH and excessive production of ACTH continued due to a lack of Cortisol Production to inhibit ACTH Synthesis via Negative Feedback.
- Excess ACTH stimulates pigment production in skin.
- Nelson’s syndrome develops within 1-4 years of surgery in 15-25% of patients.

---

# Nelson’s Syndrome

- Iatrogenic condition that occurs as a result of removal of both adrenal glands.
- Signs and symptoms: there is excessive ACTH secretion, which results in pigment production in skin, and muscle weakness due to excessive α-MSH produced.
- Treatment: trans-sphenoidal surgery to remove pituitary tumour.
- Nelson’s syndrome is now rare because bilateral adrenalectomy is now only used in extreme circumstances.
