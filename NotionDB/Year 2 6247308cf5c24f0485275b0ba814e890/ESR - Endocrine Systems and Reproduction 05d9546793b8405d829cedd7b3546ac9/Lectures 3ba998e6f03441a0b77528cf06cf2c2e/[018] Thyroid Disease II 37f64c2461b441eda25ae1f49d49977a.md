# [018] Thyroid Disease II

Progress: Reviewed

# Thyroid Nodule

- Clinically apparent Thyroid Nodules are common (4-7% Prevalence) and the majority of cases will be benign.
- Adenoma means benign proliferation.

| Benign (90%) | Malignant (10%) |
| --- | --- |
| Multinodular Goitre | Papillary Carcinoma |
| Follicular Adenomas | Follicular Carcinoma |
| Hurthle-Cell Adenomas | Medullar Carcinoma → Carcinoma of C Cells |
| Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis → Causes Localised Goitre | Anaplastic Carcinoma |
| Cysts (Colloid, Blood) | Primary Lymphoma |
|  | Metastatic (Breast, Renal) |
- Papillary and Follicular Carcinoma = Differentiated Thyroid Cancer

---

# History

- Is it a rapid growth of mass?
- Are they old (> 60) or young (< 16) - Typical Ages of Presentation
- Was the patient exposed to previous neck irradiation (Increases Risk of Cancer due to radiation damage inducing Cancerous Mutations)?
1. I-131 from Chernobyl 1986, Fukushima 2011.
2. Hodgkin’s lymphoma mantle DXT to Rx Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.
3. Px who are Radiographers or radiologists who are involved in interventional procedures using X-Rays.
- Dysphagia, stridor → Indicates compression of Oesophagus and Trachea respectively
- Lymphadenopathy → Metastatic Disease

---

# Evaluation

- Palpation: is it retrosternal (Swelling has descended so it is posterior to the Sternum)?
- Thyroid function tests (thyroid antibodies):
1. Useful if Hashimoto’s → Associated with Goitre and usually TPO Ab +ve
2. Hyperthyroidism ↓ likelihood of cancer but does not eliminate possibility of malignancy.
- Calcitonin and CEA/Carcinoembryonic Antigen: ↑ in medullary thyroid carcinoma.
- Ultrasound: first thing done.
- Thyroid scintigraphy: radioactive scan.
- Fine needle aspiration (FNA)
- CT scan if concerned about airway

---

# Scans

### Ultrasound Scan

- Cheap, easy, quick, no radiation.
- Very sensitive technique.
- Detects unsuspected/asymptomatic nodules in 44% women and 20% men.
- Most of these (1-2 mm in size) are harmless.
- Ultrasound does not distinguish between benign or malignant masses but can be used to guide FNA to collect sample of mass.
- However, Lymphadenopathy of local lymph nodes alongside Thyroid Nodules/Masses indicates Metastatic Cancer

### Thyroid Scintigraphy

- Inject Pertechnate and scan thyroid to show nodule taking up more tracer than other regions.
- Cold Nodules do not take up much tracer (aren’t readily visible on Scintigraph) whereas Hot Nodules do (are readily visible on Scintigraph)
- Cancers are Hypoactive and hence, less active at taking up tracer (Hence, less likely to be overactive/producing Excessive TH) and are considered cold nodules.
- Cold nodules: majority are benign but requires evaluation against malignancy.
- Hot nodules: 10-15% are malignant but doesn’t rule out malignancy (Less Likely but not impossible that mass is cancerous).

### Neck CT

- Useful to assess extent of retrosternal goitre and any displacement/compression of surrounding structures (Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve, Trachea, Oesophagus).
- Contrast contains iodine, therefore do scan without contrast.
- Mainly used to check if large thyroid goitre is pushing on structures.

---

# Fine Needle Aspiration and Surgery

- To tell whether benign or malignant. Sticking a needle into thyroid nodule (under ultrasound) to recover cells.

### Benign FNA (THY2)

- Purple colour representing large quantities of colloid (Suggests enlarged follicle), cells and nuclei of same size and shape. Called THY2.
- Common Histological finding of Nodules

### Suspicious/Indefinite (THY3)

- Enlarged follicular cells (follicular adenoma or carcinoma)
- Hurthle Cells (Indicative of Hurthle Cell Adenoma or Carcinoma)
- As FTC and PTC are differentiated predominantly by the arrangement of the malignant cells as Follicles or Papillae, FNA cannot differentiate between these two cancers as it does not indicate the organisation of the Malignant Cells and their association with surrounding structures
- Dx of FTC or PTC is dependent on assessing the entire tumour and looking for Characteristic organisational features (Whether Malignant cells are contained by capsule or invading capsule/Blood Vessel in FTC or whether Cells are organised into Papillae)
- There is no colloid within the Nodule (Follicular Cells have invaded into the Nodule) but cells are still present and relatively well differentiated (Cells and Nuclei are fairly uniform in shape and size)

### Malignant (THY4 or THY5)

- Papillary and Follicular cells show cell and nuclear size and shape variation.
- Suggests growth of cells in thyroid is
irregular and rapid.
- There is some colloid present but this is less than normal, indicating abnormal follicles
- Within the Nuclei of Follicular and Papillary Cells, there can be smaller dots which stain a lighter colour (Inclusion Bodies) → This suggests high Nuclear Activity and hence Proliferation

# Benign Multinodular Goitre

- Most common cause of Neck Swelling
- Non-toxic (normal TH and TSH levels), toxic (↑ T4/T3) or sometimes, hypothyroid (Low T4/T3).
- Slow growing: prevalence ↑ with age as enlarged goitre means they are more easily detected.
- Common in Iodine deficient areas (Africa, Himalayas, Alps → Endemic Goitre): iodine deficiency causes TH levels to drop.
- TSH levels ↑ to promote growth of thyroid follicular cells, causing cell proliferation.
- Dyshormogenesis: defect in molecule required for producing TH (e.g. NIS or thyroid peroxidase).
- Goitrogens: medications or substances which inhibit production of T3/T4.
1. Lithium therapy (bipolar disorder),
2. Excess ingestion of brassica vegetables (kale, broccoli, cauliflower) 
3. Antithyroid medications → Only seen in High Doses of these medications where it causes pronounced Hypothyroidism, where Raised TSH → Goitre.
- Benign multinodular goitre can be quite large. Normal thyroid is 20-40g, but these can grow to 1-2 kgs.
- These are characterised by Follicles containing lots of Colloid, with Thyroid Epithelium potentially being hyperplastic, causing them to grow into Irregular Folds that protrude into the Colloid
- This means the Follicle can appear irregularly shaped instead of rounded

# Hasimoto’s Thyroiditis

- Initially causes hyperthyroidism and later hypothyroidism (Px usually present in later stages with Hypothyroidism).
- Hyperthyroid Stage occurs as autoimmune damage causes release of TH stored within Colloid, causing T3/4 Levels to rise, causing TSH to fall
- Autoimmune: +ve anti-TPO (thyroid peroxidase) Abs.
- Genetic links: HLA DR5, CTLA4, c.f. PGAIS type II.
- Thyroid infiltrated by nodules, with this infiltrate comprised of Macrophages, B and T cells, replacing Thyroid Follicles, which causes the follicles shrink as they have been destroyed.
- Hypotrophic Follicles is responsible for reduced Colloid Synthesis, causing Hypothyroidism

---

# Papillary Thyroid Cancer

- They are differentiate thyroid cancers as they still retain characteristic elements of Thyroid Cells, predominantly NIS
- Women > men (2.5:1).
- Peak incidence 30-50 years but can occur in childhood.
- Comprises 70-75% cases of thyroid cancer (Most common type of Thyroid cancer).
- They often present as LNpathy (lymphadenopathy), indicating metastatic spread before Dx has been made (Metastasis to Lung and Bone is less common).
- Associated with genes that drive malignant growth such as:
1. RET/PTC Fusion Gene and TRK chimeric Tyr kinase genes,
2. BRAF mutations associated with poor prognosis.
- Survival rates 96% at 10 years.

### Histopathology

- Circle shows papillary thyroid cancer
- These form papillae (Finger Like structures, comprised of Malignant Cells)
- Cells in PTC often contain enlarged nuclei with Inclusion Bodies
- There is also a lack of Colloid present within Follicles, indicating that the Malignant cells are so poorly differentiated, they are unable to synthesise colloid

### Microfocus

- Tiny Papillary thyroid cancers can be seen in thyroids removed from Px with multinodular goitre.
- These cancerous nodules are usually <10mm diameter and often stain more purple than the surrounding Follicles (which tend to stain red/pink)
- Relatively benign and show limited growth. Presents histologically like a cancer but won’t kill patient (Usually Dx on Post Mortem) → They are usually Rx via Surgical Removal to prevent development.

# Follicular Thyroid Cancer

- Associated with iodine deficiency.
- Peak incidence 40-60 years → Tend to present in older ages and less frequently in Children.
- Causes 15% of thyroid cancer (minority of cases).
- Present as enlarging solitary nodule or in context of MNG.
- Spread vioa bloodstream (metastasis in 50%).
- Blood vs Lymphatic Spread means they don’t generally spread to lymph nodes, but to lungs and bones.
- Survival rates 50-60% at 10 years. Older age group and greater spread to more distant regions, so more severe.

### Histopathology

- Instead of forming columnar papillae like PTC, they tend to form Follicles that do not form Colloid due to their poor differentiation
- These Follicular Nodules tend to be found invading into nearby capillaries, indicating blood-bourne metastasis
- Follicular Nodules tend to have a fibrous capsule and often when metastasising, the Cancerous Nodule can be seen invading through the Capsule, indicating that it is metastasising (Capsular Invasion).
- As long follicular lump is within
shell, it is not considered cancer.
- When follicular lump invades through fibrous capsule, it is considered Follicular Thyroid Cancer

# Treatment of Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma

1. Total thyroidectomy and surrounding enlarged lymph nodes that are likely to contain secondary tumours/Cancerous Cells that have metastasised
2. High Dose I-131 ablation: This is because surgery doesn’t remove every malignant cell. 
- As Cancer is differentiated, Malignant cells still express NIS and hence, can still take up the Radioisotope, where the Radiation produced from Decay kills the Malignant Cells (Both in the Primary and any Secondary Tumours/Metastases) and surrounding Healthy Thyroid Cells (Ensures complete removal of Thyroid Cells that could potentially be malignant)
- As no other cells in the body express NIS, I-131 Ablation will not cause damage to other Healthy tissue in the Body, unlike Chemotherapy (Allows for Highly Targeted Therapy) → High Success Rx following Rx
- Follow up:
1. Suppression of TSH with T3 or T4 Supplements to maintain [T3/4] Despite Removal of Thyroid → This is to prevent TSH from stimulating Excessive Thyroid Cell proliferation in Secondary Tumours that have formed by metastases that could lead to Further Cancer Growth
2. Palpation of neck ± USS (Ultrasound).
3. Measure thyroglobulin levels with rTSH stimulation: blood test.
- In Theory, Surgery and I-313 Radioablation should completely destroy all Thyroid Cells in the Body, causing [Thyroglobulin] to be 0
- If [Thyroglobulin] is still present in the Blood following Surgery, this indicates that there is still Thyroid Cancer within the Body (E.g Secondary Tumour/Metastases)
1. I-123 (Less Radioactive and hence, harmful than I-131) scans with rTSH stimulation to check for any Metastases.
2. Repeated treatments with I-131 if necessary.

# Medullary Thyroid Cancer

- From C cells (Not Thyroid Cells and hence, do not respond to TSH and cannot be Rx using I-131 Radioablation or Visualised using Thyroid Schintography as cells do not express NIS)
- This is a Neuroendocrine Cancer
- Causes flushing and diarrhoea due to excessive Calcitonin release, notably when Px drinks alcohol.
- It characteristically secretes calcitonin, also CEA, which can be used to Dx.
- Associated in 25% with mutations in RET gene (part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type II) whilst 75% are Sporadic (Not part of MEN 2A)

---

# Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2

- MEN Type 1 = Pituitary Adenoma, Parathyroid Hyperplasia and Pancreatic Tumours
- MEN Type 2A = Parathyroid Hyperplasia (Seen in Men Type 1), **Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma** (Unique to MEN Type 2A and Phaeochromocytoma (Seen in MEN Type 2B)
- MEN 2B also presents with Visible Signs such as Mucosal Neuromas (Lumps around Mouth and in Intestines) and Marfan-Like Appearance (Tall, High Arched Palate etc.)
- MEN 2A → GoF Mutation in RET (Commonly in its extracellular domain), promoting Cell Growth (Notably in C-Cells, Parathyroid Cells and Chromaffin Cells)
- MEN 2B → Associated with Mutation in Tyrosine Kinase domain of RET
- Drugs targeting mutated RET can potentially be used to Selective Target and Rx Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma, which is likely to increase prognosis

---

# Anaplastic Carcinoma

- Very poorly differentiated
- Older patients (60 years +).
- Present as rapidly enlarging nodules and compressive spinal cord.
- Treatment:
1. Thyroidectomy ± tracheostomy.
2. External beam radiotherapy.
3. Chemotherapy provides no good results.
- Very poor prognosis: typically die within first 6 months

### Histopathology

- Full of completely undifferentiated cells, that cannot be identified as Parafollicular or Follicular Thyroid Cells
- These cells do not express NIS and are not found organised as Follicles
- Rapidly enlarges.

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 00.04.42.png](%5B018%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20II%2037f64c2461b441eda25ae1f49d49977a/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_00.04.42.png)

---

# Primary Thyroid Lymphoma

- Associated with Hashimoto thyroiditis as Rapid Proliferation of T and B Cells within the Inflammatory Infiltrate leads to generation of Mutations that produce Malignancy to produce a Lymphoma.
- Treatment: external beam radiotherapy → Very successful Rx and hence, tends to have a good prognosis.
- Tumours are characterised by Infiltrate of mononuclear lymphoid cells.

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 00.05.06.png](%5B018%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20II%2037f64c2461b441eda25ae1f49d49977a/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_00.05.06.png)

# Prognosis of Thyroid Cancers

- Typically have good prognosis, notably for Papillary Thyroid Cancers as they tend to occur in younger age groups and can be selectively Rx and easily Dx using Radioisotope of Iodine
- Follicular Thyroid Cancer has a slightly worse prognosis than PTC (but still higher than other Thyroid Cancer) as it typically presents in Elderly Px (Very rarely in Children)
- Prognosis of Tumours of C-Cells and Undifferentiated Thyroid Tumours is worse as these cells do not express NIS and hence, cannot be selectively visualised and Rx using 131-I
- Follicular, Anaplastic and Thyroid Lymphoma are always Sporadic (No Genetic Associations have been identified)

![Screenshot 2022-01-27 at 00.05.43.png](%5B018%5D%20Thyroid%20Disease%20II%2037f64c2461b441eda25ae1f49d49977a/Screenshot_2022-01-27_at_00.05.43.png)

# Summary

- Thyroid goitre is a very common presenting complaint in clinics.
- Vast majority of thyroid nodules/goitres are benign.
- Trick is to detect those that are not benign.
- Differentiated thyroid cancer has a very good prognosis when treated.
