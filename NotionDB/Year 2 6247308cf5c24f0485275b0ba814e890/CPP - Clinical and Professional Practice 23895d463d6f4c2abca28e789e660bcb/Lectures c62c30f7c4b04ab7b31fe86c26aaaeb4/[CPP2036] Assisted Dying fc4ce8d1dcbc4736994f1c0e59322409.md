# Euthanasia

- Literally means ‘good death’ (Greek).
- Taken to refer to intentionally hastening someone’s death for benefit of victim (mercy killing).
- Active euthanasia: killing someone intentionally.
- Passive euthanasia: letting someone die, intending their death.
- Example: by withholding or withdrawing treatment with intention that patient dies as a result.
- Note: if a patient with capacity decides to refuse lifesustaining treatment, that is treated in law as a refusal of consent, rather than as an intentional hastening of
death.
- For patients without capacity, decisions to withdraw such treatment must not be aimed at their death.
- Voluntary euthanasia: recipient wants to die.
- Involuntary euthanasia: recipient does not want to die.
- Non-voluntary euthanasia: recipient lacks capacity to decide.
- Voluntary, involuntary and non-voluntary can all be active or passive.
- All types are illegal

# R v Cox (1992)

- Mrs Boyes, aged 70, had chronic severe RA.
- Was in excruciating pain, with possibility of death at any time.
- Dr Cox had been treating her for many years and when she begged him to kill her, he injected her with a lethal dose of
potassium chloride.
- Dr Cox was charged with attempted murder, since it was not thought possible to prove beyond reasonable doubt that his injection caused patient’s death.
- Supported by patient’s family throughout trial.
- Given a 12 month suspended sentence.

### Case Established

- It is illegal to deliberately cause death even if done in order to relieve suffering.
- What can never be lawful is use of drugs with primary purpose of hastening moment of death.
- Euthanasia is legally equivalent to murder.
- Intention to kill is same, regardless of reason underlying it.

---

# Doctrine of Double Effect

- Principle that if an action has 2 foreseeable consequences, one good and one bad, action may be morally acceptable if intention is to achieve good one.
1. Good result must be achieved independently of bad one
2. Action must be proportional.
3. Action must be appropriate.
- Intending to bring about death (bad) is morally different to intending to relive patient’s pain (good), foreseeing that there is a risk of death

### Hastening an Px’s Death Unintentionally

- There is a special defence to hastening death if death was not what was intended.
- Intention of perpetrator is important in law.

---

# R v Adams (1957)

- Dr Adams charged with murder of an 81 year-old patient who had had a stroke.
- Administered large quantities of morphine with stated intention of easing her pain, knowing this was likely to kill her.
- Dr Adams was acquitted.
- “Doctor was entitled to do all that was proper and necessary to relive pain and suffering even if measures he took might accidentally shorten life” (so long as measures are right and proper).

### Case Established

- Established that medication may be given for therapeutic purposes even if it foreseeably shortens life.

### Doctrine of Double Effect

- Intended consequence: relieve pain.
- Foreseen consequence: patient’s death.
- Dr Cox administered KCl which was intended for patient’s death (had no other therapeutic benefit), through which suffering was relieved (Intended Consequence was morally wrong but Foreseen consequence was morally good).
