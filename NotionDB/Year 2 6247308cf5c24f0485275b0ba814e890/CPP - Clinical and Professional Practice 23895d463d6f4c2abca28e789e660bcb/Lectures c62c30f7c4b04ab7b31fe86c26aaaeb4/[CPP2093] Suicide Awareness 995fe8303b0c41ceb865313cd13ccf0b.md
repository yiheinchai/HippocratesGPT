# Suicide in Students and Communicating About Suicide

- Attracts a lot of media attention but students have a lower risk (less than half) of suicide than peers of the same age
- Asking someone about their suicidal thoughts does not cause someone to feel suicidal, instead it gives someone permission to talk about something that may have been troubling them

### Language of Suicide

- Replace 'committed' with 'died by' when talking about suicide as committed has connotations of illegality and perpetuates the stigma surrounding suicide
- Avoid value judgements using words like '(un)successful' and talk about the facts of the matter (attempted)
- Avoid drawing attention to a specific location or to a series of deaths that may be completely unrelated

# Threats to Student Mental Health

- Most threats related to Economic Issues/Costs of University, Social Adjustments at Uni, Loss of sense of community via online learning and anonymity due to large year-group sizes
- There is commonly a stigma and a fear of Fitness to Practice proceedings due to Mental Health, which may stop people seeking help.
- Many medical students feel shame regarding poor mental health, believing it portrays them as weak and not good enough for medical school

# Mental Health Continuum

- There is no rigid divide between mental health and mental illness as mental health is not merely the absence of mental illness
- It includes the presence of positive feelings (emotional well-being), positive individual functioning (psychological well-being) and positive functioning in society (social wellbeing)
- Small amounts of Stress can be beneficial in performance but as stress increases, mental health deteriorates, leading to functional impairment

2. Give the Px space to talk about any concerns via Open Questions 
3. Demonstrate an awareness of where to find help and provide resources to the Px
4. Offer to help them seek treatment if individual motivation to seek help is an issue (E.g give them the tools to self-refer for Therapy)

# Encouraging Conversation and Accepting Limits

- Give someone permission to reveal dark thoughts
