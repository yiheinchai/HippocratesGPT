# [CPP2044] Patient-Facing Digital Technologies

Module: DDS

# Digital Health Technologies

- Apps, programs and software used in the health and social care system
- How to use them and which to use:
- “Users (Px) must exercise their own skill and judgement when using the apps and digital tools.” - NHS Apps Library, Disclaimer
- “Doctors have a professional responsibility to provide evidence based solutions” - GMC, Good Medical Practice
- There are 3 main levels of technology:
1. Organisation - Software in healthcare facilities to help assist care (E.g Administrations, Finance, Analytics)
2. Professional
3. Patients
- EHRs can be used on all 3 levels, with input from HCPs

- Technology can improve how Px interact with the Healthcare System, educate Px and implement change (May be considered medical devices if they are diagnostic or carry out defined medical roles etc.)

# Patient-Facing Digital Solutions

- These technologies can be used to inform a consultation, be used within a consultation and after consultation within a Px’s management plan

# Clinical Evaluation

- DTAC = Digital Technology Assessment Criteria
- Clinical Safety (Often for Interventional Tools, based on Clinical Evidence) → Data Protection → Technical Assurance → Interoperability (Interactions with wider healthcare setting and other technologies) → Usability and accessibility
- As clinicians are role is primarily to evaluate clinical safety
- This also includes analysing efficacy, validity of methodology and trial design, generalisability (to your patient)
- Framework for Clinical Evaluation looks at how Px are selected for trial, how many are selected and how are they analysed (Can results from Trial Px be generalised and are they valid, usually determined by external validation)

# Data Protection

- Products are assessed to ensure that data protection and privacy is ‘by design’/integrated into the design and the rights of individuals are protected.
- Does your product have access to any personally identifiable data or NHS held patient data?
- It is important to consider how data is stored, where is it stored and what details does it include
- UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to the processing of personal data.

---

# Technical Assurance

- Products are assessed to ensure that products are secure and stable.
- Do versions keep changing? How are they updated, who/what body updates them and how are these updates communicated?
- Is the product reliable? Does it engage with clinicians or users?

---

# Interoperability

- Products are assessed to ensure that data from the application is communicated accurately and quickly whilst staying safe and secure (How easily does it allow for communication between Px and HCPs or between HCPs,).
- This is usually determine by how many other technologies feed data into and receive input from the considered technology (What other technologies is it communicated with)
- E.g. It is important that data from a patient’s ambulatory blood glucose monitor can be downloaded onto an appropriate clinical system without being restricted to one type

---

# Usability/Accessibility

- Products are allocated a conformity rating having been benchmarked against good practice and the NHS service standard.
- What is the user journey?
- How does the data flow (Where is it input, how is it processed and what is its output)?
- Understand users and their needs in context of health and social care?
- Is it an easy to use application and what previous equipment is required for its use?
- Does it reduce health inequalities? (Will those who need it most find it easiest to access?)
- If a technology is not easy to use, it is often harder to access, meaning that those who most need the technology (Ill or from lower Socioeconomic backgrounds) can’t access the technology (Establishes Healthcare Inequalities)

# Electronic Health and Px Records

- Electronic health record - These are a digital version of the paper charts in the clinician’s office (Dr facing information → Altered by Clinicians) .
- An EHR contains the medical and treatment history of the patient and it is added to by the Dr.
- Electronic patient records - These store information about that person’s health, care and wellbeing
- It is managed by the person who the record is about and they can add information to it

### Integrating Into Real World Journeys

![Screenshot 2022-01-16 at 23.43.45.png](%5BCPP2044%5D%20Patient-Facing%20Digital%20Technologies%207aaa6993ef64403bbb1dd178c0bf0214/Screenshot_2022-01-16_at_23.43.45.png)

### Considerations

- Input from patient charities, professional societies, Health Informatics, clinicians, NHS Digital, Information Governance
- Key features:
1. Interoperability
2. Privacy
3. User centred not audit centred
4. “Not just an App”

# Cardiovascular Risk Calculators

- Used to predict the chance of a health event occurring in the future
- They are used to personalise care for a patient based on their risk score:
- Lifestyle
- Medication
- Surgical intervention
- Monitor with treatments
- Used daily in healthcare across the world to look at an individual’s chance of having a heart attack
- However, these risk tables establish arbitrary cut-offs for continuous variables (E.g BP) in an attempt to assign these variables with discrete risk scores which means that 2 BPs very close to each other have significantly different risks (when this is unlikely to be the case)
- Risk factors are often all considered as equal when some risk factors have been shown to be more significant in the development of disease

# Usability

- Digital is just the apex (or the base) of a successful strategy
- Patient facing technologies also need a lot of ground work and foundation
- E.g. Patient education and clinician education

---

# MRI My Pacemaker Campaign

- 500,000 patients in England have pacemakers or defibrillators
- 75% will need an MRI scan after implantation of a cardiac device.
- 1/3 of scans are for acute or time sensitive indications (eg. cancer diagnosis, stroke, or cord compression)
- >80% patients do not meet national cancer wait or diagnostic referral targets
- This is Referrals network
- Patients and clinicians contact to find MRI
- 600-1000 users per month;
- Patients platform via website and charities as they require MRI scans for cancer and stroke diagnosis

### Educational Resources

- Developed by 6 professional societies and 2 patient charities Intended for:
1. Patients at the time of implant/MRI
2. Referring clinicians

---

# Conclusions

- Patient facing digital health technologies:
- Can play a range of roles to help healthcare provision
- Require strict evaluation, similar to any other clinical tool
- Needs careful integration into the wider healthcare system for utility
