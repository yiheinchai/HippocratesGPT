# [CPP2067] Interpretation of Epidemiological Studies

Module: SDoH

# Essential Questions to Ask

1. Could association be due to bias in way subjects were selected
for study or in way information was obtained?
2. Could it be due to differences between comparison groups
(confounding)?
3. Could it be due to chance?
4. Is association likely to be causal?
5. Are finding generalisable? Do results apply to my patients?

# Bias

### Selection Bias

- Occurs when there is a systematic difference in characteristics between characteristics of people selected for a study and characteristics of those who were not.
- Target population ‚Üí accessible population ‚Üí sample ‚Üí actual
subjects.

### Identifying Selection Bias in Epidemiological Studies

- Was study population clearly defined (did they state who they intended to approach)?
- What were inclusion and exclusion criteria?
- Were refusals, losses to follow-up, etc. kept to a minimum? And
their characteristics reported?

### Identifying Selection Bias in Case-Control Studies

- Do controls represent population from which cases arise?
- Was identification and selection of cases and controls influenced
by exposure status?

### Identifying Selection Bias in Cohort Studies

- Are the groups similar except for the exposure status?
- Is the follow-up the same for both groups?

### Measurement Bias

- Occurs when measurements or classifications of disease are
inaccurate (e.g. they do not measure correctly what they are supposed to measure).
- This can be observer bias or responder bias.

### Identifying Measurement Bias in Epidemiological Studies

- Were exposures/interventions of interest clearly defined using
standard criteria?
- Were measurements as objective as possible?
- Was study blinded as much as possible?
- Were observers/interviewers rigorously trained so that measurement observation was standardised?
- Was information provided/observations reported by patient validated against any existing records?

# Confounding

- Confounding occurs when an estimate of association between an
exposure and disease is mixed up with effect of another exposure
on same disease.
- E.g. a study may find an association between average number of
hours of sleep per night and mortality. However, this association is likely to be mixed up with age.
- People who sleep few hours may be more likely to be elderly, and it is age that is linked to mortality.
- Age is a confounder of relationship between lack of sleep and mortality.
- Confounding can be dealt with at study design level or at analysis
stage provided relevant data have been collected.
1. Stratification: stratify analysis according to confounder status (e.g. age).
2. Statistical modelling: statistical adjustments can be made to control for confounding variables.

# Chance

- When using a sample drawn from a population of interest we
make inferences about true value in population based on
observed estimate from sample.
- However, different samples from same population can yield
different estimates due to sampling variation (variation between different samples from the same population) or chance.
- Role of chance can be assessed by calculating confidence
intervals.

### Confidence Intervals

- A range of values which we are 95% confident will contain true
value of mean measure of interest in overall population.
- Example: blood pressure = 130 (95% CI 120-140). We are 95%
sure that true mean value is between 120 and 140.
- Confidence intervals are estimates of effect magnitude.
- When analysing ratios, look if CI includes 1 as if 1 is included, the result is not statistically significant.
- A statistically significance test yield probability (p or p-value).
- ùëÉ < 0.05 means that 5 times or less out of 100 samples, there is no true relationship between exposure and disease.

# Causality

- Temporal relationship: for a risk factor to cause a disease, it must
precede the disease.
- This is generally easier to establish from cohort studies but rather difficult to get from cross-sectional or case-control studies as there is no follow up so temporal relationship cannot be determined accurately
- Biological plausibility: an association is more likely to be causal if
there is a plausible biological mechanism relating to hypothesis
being tested that underlies the association between the exposure and the outcome.
- Consistency: causality is more likely if similar/consistent results have been found in different populations using different study designs.
- Strength of association: a large relative risk (strong association)
with narrow confidence intervals is more likely to be causal than a
weak association, which could more easily be result of confounding or bias.
- Dose-response relationship: ‚Üë levels of exposure lead to ‚Üë risks of
disease, there is increased evidence of a causal relationship between the drug and the disease.
- Specificity: if a particular exposure ‚Üë risk of a certain disease but
not risk of other diseases, then this is strong evidence in favour of a cause-effect relationship.
- Reversibility: when removal of a possible cause results in a ‚Üì disease risk, case for causality is strengthened.

# Generalisability

- What were characteristics of study participants (age, sex, social
class, ethnicity, comorbidities)?
- Are these characteristics present in the sample very different to your patient?
- Have results of study been replicated in other populations?
- How long ago was study conducted? Have things changed since then that might affect causality?

# Epidemiological Studies In Your Careers

- You will be doing literature reviews and evaluating studies as a clinician
- Your friend calls to ask if they should cut out coffee, after reading a magazine article about coffee causing cancer
- Your patients might ask if they should change their blood pressure medicines, after hearing on the news that they cause heart attacks
- Anyone might ask you about Covid-19 vaccines
- In 2015, my GP asked me if I would recommend the flu vaccine that year given the news about efficacy
- I taught one of the locums at my current GP practise and one of the nurses at UCL occupational health
