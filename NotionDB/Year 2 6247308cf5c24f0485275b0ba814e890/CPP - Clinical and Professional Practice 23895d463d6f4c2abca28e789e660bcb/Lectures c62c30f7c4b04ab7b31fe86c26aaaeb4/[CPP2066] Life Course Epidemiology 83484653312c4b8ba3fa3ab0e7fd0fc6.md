# [CPP2066] Life Course Epidemiology

Module: SDoH

# What is Life Course Epidemiology?

- A life course approach in epidemiology investigates long term
effects on chronic disease risk and ageing of physical and social hazards during gestation, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood and later adult life, and across generations.
- It studies biological, behavioural and psychosocial pathways that
operate across life course and influence development of chronic
diseases.

# Revival of Life Course Perspective in Epidemiology - 1980s

- Dissatisfaction with conventional adult life style models of chronic
disease risk:
1. Poor predictors of individual risk.
2. Inability to explain fully geographical, temporal and social variations.
- Natural history studies of children showing tracking of conventional risk factors.
- Forsadhl: early social conditions lead to CVD.
- Barker hypothesis (’Fetal Origins of Adult Disease’): under-nutrition in utero lead to CVD.
- Under-nutrition during critical periods of growth and development in utero has long-term effects on chronic disease risk by programming structure or function or organs, tissues or body systems.
- Evidence from maturing birth cohort studies.

# British 1946 Birth Cohort - MRC National Survey of Health and Development

- This survey came into existence due to declining birth rates

### Childbirth in Britain (1946)

- Social class gradients in:
1. Birth weight
2. Perinatal mortality
3. Cost of childbirth.
4. Medical support:
- Antenatal care
- Hospital vs home birth.
- Presence of a doctor at birth.
- Use of pain relief.
- 51% had running hot water (79% by 1957).
- 57% of families had their own bathroom.
- Britain in mid-1940s:
1. 2% had refrigerators.
2. 4% had washing machines.
3. 40% had vacuum cleaners.
- Beveridge’s five giant evils as reported in the Beveridge Report: want, disease, ignorance, squalor, idleness.

### Changes in Britain Since 1946 (Health)

- Introduction of NHS.
- Development of vaccines.
- ↓ of occupational hazards (e.g. pneumoconiosis).
- Clean air act (1956) which regulates the amount of coal that could be burnt in an attempt to reduce air pollution.
- Shift to diseases of middle and later life due to reduced early mortality (e.g. cancer, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative).

### Changes in Britain Since 1946 (Education)

- 1944 Education Act - Mandates selective education based on examination results at the end of primary school.
- Crowther report (1959).
- Newsom report (1963).
- Robbins report (1963).
- These 3 reports listed recommended changes in changes in education across all levels from Primary to University Level
- Plowden committee (1963).

### Changes in Britain Since 1946 (Emotional Wellbeing)

- ‘But one must never pick the baby up – it was practically
incestuous to enjoy one’s baby.
- In my day, we were instructed that frost never hurt a baby yet, and if the baby cried it must be mastered’ (A mother on the Truby King Mothercraft doctrine of 1935).
- ‘Mother-love in infancy is as important for mental health as are proteins and vitamins for physical health’ (Bowlby, 1953).
- This led to an increased acceptance and encouragement of mother-baby intimacy and attachment as healthy rather than harmful/shameful

# Towards a Life Course Framework - Cardiovascular Disease

- Barker et al (1993): ↓ SMR (Standardised Mortality Ratio) as ↑ birthweight
- The Geographical Distribution of the Prevalence of Ischaemic Disease was very similar to the Geographical Distribution of Infant Mortality (proxy measure of low birth weight)
- This is likely because Fetal Undernutrition (giving rise to Low Birth Weight) alters Physiology to increase Serum LDL, Cholesterol and Fibrinogen, Trigger Hypertension and Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and T2DM, increasing the risk of CHD (Notably IHD)
- As Birth Weight Increases, Systolic BP Decreases, with this reduction in Systolic BP becoming larger as an individual ages
- However, For individuals born within the Manual Social Class, Systolic BP is increased, with this increase growing exponentially with Age

# Towards a Life Course Framework - Musculoskeletal Function

### **Cognition**

- Key determinant of everyday mastery (’the flexible adaptation of means in the pursuit of one’s goals.
- Highly socially and culturally patterned.
- Marker of underlying physiological process.
- Therefore, it is associated with health and survival.
- Those with greater cognitive score live longer.
- Cognitive Function is commonly classified into the binary categories of:
1. Crystallised Pragmatics - Acquisition of Linguistic/Communicative Knowledge (E.g Vocabulary, Pronounciation)
2. Fluid Mechanics - Cognitive Functions that are heavily dependent on high attention levels (E.g Memory and Cognitive Processing)
- Crystallised Pragmatics is assessed using the National Adult Reading Test (NART), where Adults are asked to pronounce words that violate normal pronunciation rules in the English Language
- Fluid Mechanics is tested via assessing processing speed via Timed Letter Cancellation, where various rows of letters are organised on a sheet of paper and individuals are assessed on how many times they can accurately cross out a specific letter in the rows within a minute
- There are associations between father’s social class and childhood cognition, child midlife social class and childhood education, with childhood education impacting midlife social class.
- Childhood cognition and education influence cognitive skills
- In individuals born before 1946, there is a stronger link between Childhood Cognition, education and midlife social class whereas in individuals born after 1946, the association between Education and Midlife Literacy was stronger (due to an increase in Child Leaving Age from School increasing mean education level in the Population)

- ACE-III is the most complex screen of cognition that is used to assess cognitive impairment clinically

### **Physical and Neural Growth**

- Foetal size/Birth Weight (rate of growth, duration of pregnancy) and postnatal somatic and CNS growth (motor milestone attainment of sitting, standing, walking and first word) linked to cognitive and behavioural development.
- This increase plateaus and may slightly decrease at very high birth weights due to the negative effects of Macrosomy on the development and cognition of the baby

### Birth Weight

- Shenkin et al (2004) (systematic review): small, consistent, +ve
association between birth weight and childhood cognitive ability, even when corrected for confounders.

### Common-Cause Mechanism

- Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) play a critical role in determining
physical growth, and have receptors located in brains areas important for cognition (e.g. hippocampus).
- Thyroid hormone also has dual somatic and CNS effects, and may also interact with IGF.
- Glucocorticoid are -ve associated with physical growth and with
cognition, are partly under control of thyroid hormone, and also ↓
IGF production.

### Obstetric Insult

- Nicotine, alcohol and drug use during pregnancy are associated
with offspring cognitive and behavioural problems.
- But associations may be confounded by maternal characteristics,
including genetic factors that select these consumptive behaviours
and also operate during postnatal rearing.
- There are teratogenic effects of hypoxia, infection, metabolic imbalance, pharmacological treatments and environmental agents (subject to similar bias, and also by indication where the drug might be prescribed in an attempt to correct cognitive and behaviour defects).

### Early Nutrition

- Maternal diet during pregnancy: intake of n-3 PUFAs prolongs duration of pregnancy, placental transmission, and contributes to formation of breast milk.
- Breast milk (essential fatty acids/n-3 PUFAs) directly benefits offspring IQ but association is confounded by maternal IQ.
- Infant diet high in fruit, vegetables and home-prepared foods
associated with higher IQ after adjusting for a wide range of
potential confounders

### Age 8 Reading Scored by Level of Parental Interest in Education

- ↑ parental interest in education leads to ↑ average reading scores in children across both sexes and various social classes.

# Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study

- Childhood abuse and household dysfunction associated with:
1. Internalised disorders
2. Attempted suicide
3. Somatic heath disturbances.
4. Substance abuse including injecting.
5. Early intercourse and promiscuity.
6. Intimate partner violence.

# Cognition and Dementia

### Education

- Childhood and Higher/Adult Education are positively correlated with Fluid Cognition levels
- Schooling provides specific skills for industrial and postindustrial economies, and socializes individuals for achievement (human capital theory)
- Schools also confer credentials that employers use to select us into the labour force (screening/signalling theory)
- Childhood cognition correlates strongly with early adult
cognition, midlife cognition (allowing for social class of origin,
education, and own social class) and later life cognition

### Alzheimers

- Alzheimer’s Disease Prevalence increases exponentially with age, notably from 65 years of age onwards (it doubles in prevalence every 5 years above 65 years of age) all around the world, notably in middle to high income countries as individuals are living long enough in these countries to be at risk of Alzheimer’s

### Cardiovascular Risk Factors For Dementia

- Cardiovascular Modifiable Risk Factors seem to be most important in increasing the risk of developing Dementia
- BMI (underweight and obesity)
- Midlife hypertension (brain = low impedance organ)
- Diabetes (brain = high consumer of glucose)
- Hypercholesterolaemia
- Stroke
- These risk factors seem to be synergistic in action, with risk of Dementia increasing exponentially as the number of risk factors that an individual has increases
