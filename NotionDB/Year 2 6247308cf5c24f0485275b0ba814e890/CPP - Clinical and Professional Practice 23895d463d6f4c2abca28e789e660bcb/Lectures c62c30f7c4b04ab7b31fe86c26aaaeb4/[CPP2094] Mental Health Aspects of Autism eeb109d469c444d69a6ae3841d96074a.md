# [CPP2094] Mental Health : Aspects of Autism

Module: Mental Health

# Birth of Autism

- Kanner and his collegues defined Autism as a syndrome with 2 main features:
1. Inborn autistic disturbances of affective contact - Altered Social and Emotional Relating to others
2. Poweful desire for sameness/uniformity - Difficult coping with Change and Uncertainty
- Today, Autism Sx are mainly divided into Social Sx and Non-Social Sx
- It is now understood that Autism presents as:
1. Difficulties with Social Reciprocity and Social Communication
2. Repetitive and Restricted Interests and Behaviours

---

# DSM-V Criteria

1. Social Communication
- Difficulties with Socio-emotional reciprocity - Understanding and Responding to other’s Emotions and view points
- Abnormal Non-verbal communication (E.g Little Eye Contact, Less Facial Expression/Gesture)
- Difficulties with Relationships - E.g Making and Maintaining Friendships, Lack of Understanding of Social Rules/Conventions underlying Relationships and Conversations (E.g Conversations may appear one sided)
1. Repetitive and stereotyped behaviour
- Stereotyped repetitive behaviour and speech
- Routines and rituals - Following Structured and Predictable behaviour patterns
- Fixated interests/Fascinations on Very Niche/Non-Typical Topics
- Sensory abnormalities due to Atypical Sensory Processing (E.g Heightened Senses which may become overwhelming/uncomfortable)

# Views on Autism

- Autism was once considered a Categorical Vs Continuous/Spectrum Disorder, with Px being classed into a Discrete Category depending on whether they had or didn’t have Autism

- But it is more likely to be a dimensional condition that is found on a spectrum of Sx intensity and number, where if an individual has a number/magnitude of Autistic Sx above a threshold, they are seen as having Autistic Spectrum Disorder clinically
- However, this threshold/cut-off between having and not having Autistic Spectrum Disorder is Arbitrary is based on the point at which Autistic Sx become pronounced enough to warrant a Clinical Dx of Autistic Spectrum Disorder where additional support may be necessary

- Originally, Autism was originally deemed to be caused by the Mother.
- Refrigerator Mother Hypothesis - Lack of Intimate and Emotive Relationship/Attachment between the Mother and Child led to Social Deficits in the Child which manifested as Autistic Spectrum Disorder
- This has now been disproven, with the High Inheritability (60-90%) of ASD suggesting a Genetic Cause (Thought to be Polygenic Predominantly but there have been cases with Mongenic Causes, where the Mutation has a very high penetrance)
- Current best estimates are that the prevalence of Autistic Spectrum Disorder is 1-2% of the general population, with this prevalence increasing over time not due to more people being born with ASD but rather, more Px are being correctly diagnosed with ASD who may not present with Severe or Classical Autistic Sx (Fewer False Negatives/Missed Dx).
- Autism is a lifelong condition – so this applies to adults (including older adults) too
- 50-70% of people diagnosed with autism have an IQ in the normal range, and fluent language but not all Px with ASD present with Cognitive/IQ and Linguistic Deficits
- Whilst Autism is often understood to manifest as Social and Processing Deficits/Limitations it also can provide advantages/strengths to individuals in regards to Pattern Recognition, Objectivity (Less Personal Bias/Prejudice), Expertise and Detail-Focused Processing as Px with ASD often view and approach situations differently to those without ASD, allowing for new insights to be provided
- However, despite the strengths that ASD can provide to an individual, under current systems of care, outcomes for autistic people are poor:
1. Low participation in education (can lead to Academic Underachievement) and the work place (Unemployed or Employed in Job Roles that do not adequately use their expertise/knowledge)
2. Low quality of life
3. Low life expectancy
- Reflects higher mortality from a range of causes of death
- Epilepsy is particularly implicated for those with learning disability
- Suicide biggest cause of death for those with ASD without a learning disability

# Mental Health and Autism

- Autism is not a mental health problem (it is a form of Neurodiversity) but autistic people are at high risk of developing a range of mental health problems in Adolescence, which persist at similar rates in adults
- E.g 70% of Children (10-14 Years Old) who had ASD had at least 1 MH Condition and 40% had >2 MH Conditions
- This means that mental health problems are very common amongst Autistic Adults and reduce QoL and levels of functioning
- Pre-existing MH Problems in Autistic Individuals act as risk factors for further mental health problems (E.g ADHD Depression) and they make a major contribution to the High Mortality of Autistic People, notably by increasing suicide rates
- When considering Mental Health Problems in Autistic Individuals:
1. ADHD is more common in children and adolescents and is the most common MH Problem seen in those with Autism (Around 30% of Autistic individuals)
2. Generally, a wide range of MH Conditions are more prevalent in Autistic individuals than in the general population
3. Schizophrenia, depression and bipolar are more common in adults than on kids as they tend to have their onset in late adolescence/adulthood
4. Schizophrenia is more common in those with intellectual disability
5. Depression is more common in autistic women than autistic men

# Why are the Rates of Co-Occurring Mental Health Diagnoses so High

- Theory 1 – Overlapping symptoms of Autism and some MH conditions, making it appear as though Px has Sx that are caused by other MH Conditions when they are just caused by Autism (Phenocopy Idea)
- Theory 2 – Shared underlying mechanisms (E.g Common Biopsychosocial Causes/Factors) between autism and some MH conditions which causes both Autism and MH Conditions to copresent
- Theory 3 – Autism is a risk factor for development of some mental health conditions and so, Autistic individuals are at a greater risk for MH Conditions

### Overlapping Sx - Phenocopy Theory

- Social Anxiety Disorder = Persistent fear of social performance situations where the person is exposed to unfamiliar people/scrutiny by others. The Px fears that they will act in a way that displays their anxiety Sx, which will be embarassing and humiliating
- Some characteristics of autism could be mislabelled as social anxiety disorder due to social difficulties and disinterest with social environments/relationships seen in Autism which may present as Social Eversion that is seen in Social Anxiety Disorder
- Other MH conditions that include symptoms that look
similar to some aspects of autism are Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (Autistic Ritual/Pattern of Behaviour is interpreted as OCD Compulsion) and Schizophrenia (E.g Altered Sensory Processing in Autism may be interpreted as Hallucinations)

### Shared Underlying Mechanism

- ADHD and autism share some common genetic risk factors and neurocognitive architectural features and therefore, when these common causes are present, they can trigger the development of ADHD and Autism simultaneously

### Autism as a Risk Factor For Mental Health Conditions

- Autism May Act as a Direct Risk Factor (Autism → Mental Health Problem - Autism directly causes MH Problem) or an Indirect Risk Factor (Autism → Risk Factor → Mental Health Problem - Autism is a risk factor for negative experiences, which in turn put a Px at a greater risk of MH problems)

**Direct Risk Factor**

- Avoidant / Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID):
- A persistent disturbance in feeding or eating that can result in severe malnutrition, significant weight loss or a failure to gain weight, growth compromise, and/or a marked interference with psychosocial functioning, **without weight or body image concerns** (i.e. in contrast to anorexia nervosa)
- The rates of ARFID are very high amongst autistic individuals because Autistic Characteristics are a direct risk factor for ARFID such as:
1. Sensory sensitivities - Oral (Taste and Texture) Sensitivity can mean that Eating is unpleasant, causing Feeding Repulsion
2. Resistance to change
3. Intolerance of uncertainty - More likely to eat processed/ready meals (E.g Digestives, Crisps) as these flavours and textures are extremely predictable and hence, less likely to change between food items

**Indirect Risk Factor**

- Autism is a risk factor for multiple experiences that are themselves a risk factor for MH problems.
- These include:
1. Unemployment
2. Bullying and victimization
3. Social isolation and peer rejection
4. Stress

# Treatment

- For some MH conditions, it is likely that autism-specific assessment methods and treatments will be needed but they are not currently available
- There are barriers to autistic people accessing MH treatment, meaning that Autistic Px often are unable to receive Rx for their conditions, for example:
1. Sensory difficulties
2. Communication difficulties

---

# Summary

- Autistic people are at high risk of developing a range of MH problems.
- These usually start in childhood, and are present across the lifespan.
- These MH difficulties have a profound impact on functioning, wellbeing, physical health and mortality.
- And yet currently there is a limited evidence base on how to treat MH problems of autistic people.
