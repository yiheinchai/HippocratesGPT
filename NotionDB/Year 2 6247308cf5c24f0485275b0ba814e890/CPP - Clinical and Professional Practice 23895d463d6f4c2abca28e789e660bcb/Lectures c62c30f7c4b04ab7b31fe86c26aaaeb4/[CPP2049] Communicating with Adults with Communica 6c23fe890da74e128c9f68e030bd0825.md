# [CPP2049] Communicating with Adults with Communication and Hearing Difficulties

Module: Clinical Communication

# Importance of Effective Communication

- Effective Communication is important in:
- Taking an accurate case history
- Ensuring that medical advice is followed accurately
- Obtaining informed consent to treatment
- Gaining the patient’s confidence & trust
- Reducing frustration for doctor and patient
- Reducing consultation time

---

# Ways of Classifying Communication

### Voice

- Sound made when vocal folds vibrate  with air passing through them
- This is the first stage of the speech chain of verbal communication

### Speech

- Articulating words (Motor Aspect of Communication)
- Shaping voice (sound) into words via augmentation of the vibrations produced by the Vocal Folds by oropharyngeal structures

### Language

- Cognitive Aspect of Communication where meaning is attributed to different words and words are organised according to the rules of grammar to form coherent sentences
- Comprehension (receptive language → Fluent comprehension of Speech)
- Expression (expressive language → cognitive formation of coherent speech)

### Non-Verbal

- Reading/writing
- Gesture/Body Language
- Facial expression

### Cognitive Communication (Social Communication)

- Use of ‘unwritten rules of communication’ (E.g Social Conventions of Speech/Idioms, Turn Taking, Active Listening)
- Subconscious aspects of communication which keeps a conversation flowing

### Congenital/Acquired

- Born with communication difficulties, part of development → Congenital
- Acquired difficulties after birth → Acquired
- Stable vs progressive difficulties depending on whether the communication deficit progressively worsens over time or remains at the same level (E.g Stroke)

# Types of Communication Difficulties

- In Px with specific Communication Deficits, there may be increased usage of other, non-affected forms of communication to compensate and allow for meaning to still be conveyed

### Dysarthria

- Neuromuscular disorder of speech movement (Motor Speech Production), where muscles responsible in speech articulation are affected
- Difficulty with expression only but not to do with language (comprehension and formation of speech plans)
- Speech can sound slurred or mumbled for example, but the words being used are appropriate

### Apraxia of Speech (Dyspraxia)

- A disorder of speech motor-programming, which makes voluntary speech movement difficult or impossible (Difficulty coordinating the muscular articulator of speech and getting them into the right position to produce the words you want to say)
- This is caused by a lack of coordination of the muscular articulators of speech which distorts speech
- May be called articulatory or verbal dyspraxia
- Often associated with oral dyspraxia – diagnosed when person cannot carry out non-speech mouth movements on command (e.g. “open your mouth”, “smile”), but are able to produce
these movements automatically and understand what is required
- Commonly occurs after a Stroke or as part of a dementia.

### Cognitive Communication Disorder

- Disorder of cognitive skills which has an impact on communication (e.g Memory → Impaired Retrieval of Words or memory of previous conversation to allow you to contextualise your position within a conversation)
- Defects in Cognitive Communication often include lack of awareness of social conversational cues and humour
- This is commonly seen in Px with Dementia, Traumatic Brain Injury (notably to the Frontal Lobe)

### Dysphonia

- Voice impairment, often due to pathology/damage of the Vocal Folds
- Voice may sound breathy, or rough, or strained

---

# Aphasia

- Disorder of language processing (comprehension and formation of motor plan for language)
- Can impact expressive & receptive language
- Difficulty understanding written &/or spoken language
- Difficulty using verbal or written language
- May misunderstand what has been said or say the wrong words/words which do not make sense (Expressive Aphasia)
- Px with Expressive Aphasia often use Paraphasias, where a word is replaced by a related word (either semantically or phonically related) which does not make sense in the context of the sentence/affects accurate communication of meaning (E.g Saying Table instead of Chair)

### **Aetiologies**

- Stroke (CVA): 20-30% of people who have a Stroke have a recognisable aphasia immediately post-Stroke and 10% will have persisting aphasia
- Brain tumour
- Head injury (TBI)
- Subarachnoid haemorrhage

### **Aphasia and the Brain**

- Many areas of the brain (primarily the cortex) are involved in language processing, particularly in the dominant (usually Left) hemisphere
- Different areas and tracts have different roles in language processing
- Damage to an of the language areas or tracts can result in aphasia
- Brain imaging techniques identify lesion site, but are currently of limited use in assessing the type and severity of aphasia
- The type and severity of aphasia varies with the size and site of the lesion

### **Nature of Aphasia**

- Aphasia varies greatly from person to person
- Difficulties may range from occasional errors to a complete loss of understanding of language
- Breakdowns may occur at any level of language processing and at more than one level in the same person
- Comprehension and expression may be differentially affected in the same person
- Processing of spoken and written language may be differentially affected in the same person

### **Common Difficulties at a Single Word and Sentence Level**

- Recognising the forms of whole words (“shirt – what is a shirt?”)
- Retrieving the meaning, correct sound or spelling pattern of the word
- Understanding key words within a sentence
- Retrieving and producing individual key words of a sentence
- Putting key words in the right order in a sentence
- Understanding grammatical words (e.g. of/the/him/by) and word endings (e.g. waited, houses)
- Retrieving and producing grammatical words and word endings
- Understanding complex sentences (e.g. “The doctor who you saw yesterday gave you this medicine”, “You should take one of these if you feel dizzy, but only after a meal”)
- Combining information from a number of sentences to understand a long utterance or written text

### Complicating Factors with Aphasia

- The following difficulties may co-occur, either pre-morbidly or as a result of the Stroke/Head injury, and may affect recovery:
1. Other communication or swallowing problems: immediately post-Stroke, swallowing/eating problems (Dysphagia) and speech movement problems (Dysarthria) are common
2. Cognitive impairments
3. Perceptual difficulties (vision, hearing, proprioception)
4. Fatigue
5. Physical disabilities (often a hemiplegia/hemiparesis of the right side)
6. Other medical conditions (diabetes, coronary heart disease)
- Social and personal circumstances will also affect recovery

### Aphasia From Communication Impairment Associated Dementia

| Aphasia | Dementia |
| --- | --- |
| Usually occurs with sudden onset | Occurs slowly over time |
| Language deficits may decrease over time | Language deficits increase over time |
| Due to focal lesion(s) | Accompanied by diffuse brain damage |
| Has minimal effect on intellect | Loss of reasoning ability is a primary feature |
| Presents primarily as an impairment in
language function and communication | Presents as a widespread deterioration of
both cognitive and language functions |

# Impact of Communication Disorders

| Impact on Day to Day Life | Impact When in Hospital |
| --- | --- |
| Difficulty Conversing with Family/Friends → Breakdown of Relationships | Difficulty Understanding how medications need to be taken and what they are for → Mismanagement |
| Difficulty speaking on the Phone due to lack of non-verbal cues → Loss of Independence | Difficulty expressing what is wrong → Diagnosis |
| Difficulty reading newspaper/text messages etc. → Social Isolation | Difficult discussing discharge plans → Px’s wishes not being considered |
| Difficulty with many leisure activities where communication is critical E.g watching TV → Reduced QoL | Difficulty consenting to medical treatment and being fully involved in decision making about your own health → Reduced Trust in HCPs |

# How to Support Communication

- Gather baseline communication information within case history from family, GP, Speech Language Therapist/SLT
- Ask patient/family what supports communication and what strategies help
- Ask the SLT to assess/support communication
- Gain the patient’s attention before you speak
- Simplify information- ask Y/N questions (closed questions), one piece of information at a time/shorten sentences (can be especially helpful in Px with Receptive Aphasia)
- Pause and slow rate if needed but important to not do this excessively to prevent coming across patronising
- Use plain English and visual cues/gesture
- Don’t raise your volume unless you need to
- Use silence to give the patient plenty of time to speak
- Always have paper and pen ready to allow for multimodal communication to more effectively allow meaning to be communicated between two parties
- Recap to make sure you have understood

---

# Strategies to Understand a Person with Aphasia

- Allow time to respond
- ALWAYS have paper and pencil handy
- Encourage any form of response: the person may be able to:
1. write the word or first letter
2. draw
3. gesture
4. use another word that gives a clue
- Ask further questions to clarify the message
- Structure questions carefully:
1. Yes/no questions
2. multiple choice questions (helps to write the choices down)
3. open questions
- Recap and feed back to check that you’ve understood correctly
- Make eye contact and listen carefully

---

# Strategies to Help a Person with Aphasia Understand You

- Find out which strategies help the person
(ask him/her or relatives)
- Slow down, but use normal adult language and tone of voice
- Make eye contact and attract person’s
attention before starting to speak
- Use plain English, avoiding medical terms unfamiliar to the general public
- Say one thing at a time, pausing in
between
- Make clear when there is a change of
topic
- Use non-verbal communication to
support what you say:
1. Gesture or drawing; writing down
key words; pointing
- Rephrase if something is not understood
- Use examples to illustrate the meaning
- Ask questions to check that the person
has understood you correctly

---

# Strategies to Aid Lip-Reading

- Gain Px’s attention before speaking
- Speak clearly, but don’t exaggerate or over-emphasise words as this can distort lip movements and hence, make it harder for the Px to Lip-Read
- Don’t cover mouth with hair, hands, pencil etc and make sure light source is on your face so that the Px can see your lips
- Use appropriate volume and speed

### If Communication Breaks Down, Try...

- Repeating the same word(s) once or twice
- Slow down a little
- Use more facial expression and gesture
- Write it down
- Reduce background noise/echo which can distort comprehension (notably in Px with Hearing Aids)
- Find out about hearing aids and if they are working

---

# British Sign Language

- Natural sign language used in Britain
- Includes a rich grammar
- Includes manual signs and non-manual features (E.g Size of an Object can be conveyed by size/magnitude of Signs)
- Is akin to speaking a 2nd language

---

# When and How to Use an Interpreter

- Make sure you have the right type of interpreter e.g. lip speakers vs sign language
- Speak to and maintain eye contact with the Deaf person and don’t speak to or ask questions to the interpreter
- Recognise the role of the interpreter and establish mutual expectations to aid the ease of communication established
- Consult with the Deaf person and interpreter what seating arrangements work best
