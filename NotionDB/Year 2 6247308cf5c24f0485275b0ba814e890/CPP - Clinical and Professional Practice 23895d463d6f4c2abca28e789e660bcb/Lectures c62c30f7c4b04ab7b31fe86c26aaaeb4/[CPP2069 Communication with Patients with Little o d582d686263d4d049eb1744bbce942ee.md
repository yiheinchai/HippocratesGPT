# [CPP2069 Communication with Patients with Little or No English

Module: Clinical Communication

# General Medical Council

- You must give patients the information they want or need to know
in a way that they can understand.
- You should make sure that arrangements are made wherever
possible, to meet patients’ language and communication needs.

---

# Language Barrier Effects

- Individual’s (patient’s) feelings/perceptions: feelings of
helplessness, ↓ sense of control, perception of being listened to, lack of confidence that their needs are being understood
- Actual effectiveness of communication: less is done in a longer
time, uncertainty about whether goals have been achieved.
- Patients who are not fluent in English are less likely to:
1. Receive empathic responses from doctors.
2. Establish rapport with doctors.
3. Receive sufficient information.
4. Be encouraged to participate in medical decision making.

# Common Issues

- Uncertainty about whether all key information has been
exchanged and that the Px’s medical needs have been fully
established.
- Difficulty in confirming the accuracy of important details.
- Misunderstandings due to the use of medical jargon,
colloquialisms and low frequency words.
- Reduced checking and consolidation of information.
- Lack of time allocated to ensuring that there is a clearly agreed
immediate plan, with a focus on patient safety.

### Using Alternative Words

- Many nouns and verbs in English have synonyms, which native
speakers use interchangeably.
- But some are ‘low frequency’ and are less likely to be known by
a non-native speaker (e.g. compare ‘red’ vs. ‘crimson’).
- In these cases, using images may be effective to communicate the idea you are trying to express in a manner that the other person can understand despite the Language Barrier

# How Do You Know When Someone Understands you

- Verbal clues
1. Content, e.g. reflection, even if in pidgin English (‘he come
here?’).
2. Quasi-speech (e.g. mm-hmm, ahah).
- Non-verbal clues
1. Body language and gestures.
2. Eye contact.
3. Facial expression.

Monitoring verbal and non-verbal indicators of understanding is
particularly important when language is not fluent.

# Other Consideration

**Facial expressions**

- There is good evidence that some facial expressions are universal.
- However be aware that there are cultural differences both in the acceptability of expressing certain emotions, and in the ways in which emotions are expressed.
- Facial expressions can be used to communicate emotions or physical symptoms (such as pain), so be alert to cues as to which of these the patient is conveying.
- Using visual clues (such as miming exaggerated facial expressions) can help to augment verbal communication.

**Gestures:**

- Culturally specific and therefore very unreliable in context of communicating, particularly when there is already a language barrier
- For example, thumbs up and ‘ok’ are both very rude in some countries.
- Beware, you may well find yourself instinctively using them to show a patient that you have understood them, notably when you have consciously been using gestures to enhance your communication in a consultation.

**Cultural differences:**

- There can be cultural variation in beliefs about illness and treatment, perception of roles of doctor and patient, expectations of doctor-patient relationship, involvement of family, how decisions are made and who makes them.
- But there are also individual differences within these different perspectives so you can’t assume a Px’s perspective based on culture.
- Finding out about a person’s cultural norms and their perspective
can be critical to achieving effective communication, in addition to
addressing the language barrier itself.

# Skills to Use

1. Get patient’s name right (Pronounciation and Title) - This shows respect for the Px and helps to build a rapport 
2. Give verbal and non-verbal reassurance (particularly monitoring your own non-verbal cues like Facial Expression when trying to work out how to explain something as these non-verbal cues can often be misinterpreted).
3. Use pictures/drawings (be creative) to aid communication
4. Slow down and be Patient - This helps to separate individuals words, which are easier to recognise and help with the cognitive burden of translating for the Px
5. Allow time - Don’t rush a consultation E.g GP surgeries often try to offer a double appointment if they know patient has little or no English.
6. Use the Px’s own words or terms of reference - Px may use words incorrectly but it’s clear what they mean (E.g ‘Big Pain’) so using the Px’s own words shows the Px you are listening and understanding what they are saying
- Once you have found a word or phrase that works, be careful about
suddenly (and unthinkingly) introducing a synonym as the Px may not understand the Synonym.
1. Keep the language simple
2. Take time to check and consolidate - Summarising provides reassurance that the information gathered in the consultation is correct. 
3. Write down Important points for the Px to take away - This aids information recall, reduces anxiety and enables a Px to look up information (E.g Diagnosis). In Px where a Language Barrier might be present, it gives the Px information that they can translate into their native language, aiding communication
4. Ensure the Px is clear about the plan going forward

# Working with Interpreters

## Be Aware of:

### Non-Trained/Lay Interpreters (Family/Friend/Child)

- This can raise issues regarding confidentiality, filtering of information (e.g. due to embarrassment) and patient autonomy.
- Children and teenagers may be exposed to information and decision- making inappropriate to their age and relationship to the patient.
- You should exercise your own judgement about the appropriateness and scope of working with a lay interpreter – this may depend on the clinical problem, the patient’s expressed preferences, urgency, etc.
- Keep in mind your options, e.g. to wait until a trained interpreter is available, conduct part of the consultation with the lay interpreter, etc.

### Trained Interpreters

- May speak a different dialect.
- Difficulty building a working relationship with patient due to presence of intermediary.
- Tendency to have ‘surface’ discussions about basics.
- Loss of nuance/difficulty in discussing emotions. Some words/ideas are very hard to translate.
- Px may struggle to express or discuss emotions
- Consultation takes longer.
