# Abortion Has Been A Criminal Offence In UK Since 19th Century

- 2 doctors threatened with prosecution in 2012.
- 2 women recently prosecuted for unlawful abortions

# 1967 Abortion Act

- Prior to the 1967 Abortion Act:
- There were ~100,000 abortions/year (Home Office estimate).
- Up to 20% hospital gynaecological admissions were due to the consequences of unsafe abortion.
- Today, a medical abortion is achieved by taking two pills - mifepristone and misoprostol. Surgical abortions involve procedures which are done with either local or general anaesthetic.
- Over the past decades, abortion rates have been decreasing for women aged under 18 and have been increasing for women aged over 35

# Abortion Law Timeline

### Offenses Against The Person (OPA) Act 1861

- Determined the criminalisation of activities ranging from murder, to bigamy to abduction.
- Amongst these, it made it a criminal offence for a pregnant woman to procure a miscarriage - The penalty was life imprisonment
- Mere intent to cause an abortion was sufficient for persecution: in 1927 a 13-year-old girl was prosecuted for attempting to induce an abortion by taking laxatives and sitting in a hot bath.
- At this time, the only recognised justification for abortion was if the life of the woman was in danger.

### Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929

- This described the criminal offence of ‘Child destruction’: to destroy the life of a child capable of being born before it has an existence independent of the mother.
- The aim of the Act was to close a loophole in the law that potentially allowed the killing of the fetus during delivery.
- It established viability of the fetus as significant and had the incidental effect of placing a **28 week limit on abortions**.
- Abortion remained permissible if there was deemed to be a threat to the woman's life, however doctors varied in their interpretation of what counted as a realistic threat.

---

# R v Bourne

- Dr Bourne a gynaecologist working at St Mary's hospital provided an abortion free-of-charge for a 14-year-old girl who had been sexually assaulted by soldiers in a London barracks.
- She had previously been turned away after presenting to St Thomas' Hospital, on the grounds that she 'might be carrying a future Prime Minister'.
- He performed the abortion and then told the police what he’d done to force a prosecution – which since became a test case for abortion.
- The court acquitted Dr Bourne, finding that he had acted to preserve the health of the young woman.
- This led to the law being interpreted as allowing lawful abortion if, “the continuance of the pregnancy will be to make the woman a physical or mental wreck”.
- In England, saving the life of the pregnant woman had always been allowable as a defence - this was still the case after the 1861 Act.
- This case therefore extended defences to include 'preserving health' as well.
- However, importantly abortion itself remained unlawful.
- Unsurprisingly, doctors varied in their interpretation of what counted as a good enough reason to justify an abortion and this was the law that governed abortion right up to 1967.

---

# Abortion Act 1967

- The 1967 Abortion Act was passed in order to end backstreet abortions and protect women against the harm of undergoing them, which included the risk of death and infertility.
- The Act did not give women a legal right to abortion (it remained a criminal offense)
- It allows certain legal defences for ‘registered medical practitioners’ who provide abortions.
- These defences were on the grounds that:
1. The continuation of the pregnancy would involve:
- Risk to the life of the pregnant woman
- Injury to her physical or mental health
- Injury to her existing children
1. Risk of serious physical or mental disability to child
- Importantly this **did not** give women a legal right to abortion.
- Abortion remained (and remains) a criminal offence in mainland UK.

Further legal requirements:

- Abortions must be performed within an NHS hospital or approved place.
- Two registered medical practitioners must certify in good faith that the abortion is performed for grounds specified within the Act.
- Abortions much be performed by the legal limit of 28 weeks.

3. To avoid injury to physical or mental health of woman.
4. To avoid injury to physical or mental health of existing children.
5. If child was likely to be severely physically or mentally disabled.

# Conscientious Objection

- The 1967 Abortion Act gives healthcare professionals with a conscientious objection to abortion care the legal right to opt out of participating in abortion care.
- They cannot opt out of Abortion Care if the Woman cannot still access an abortion (as they have a duty to make sure the woman can still access an abortion) if if one is needed to save her life to prevent serious harm
- Doctors with a conscientious objection to abortion do not lose their duty of care to a pregnancy woman seeking an abortion.
- Patients have a right to see another doctor.
- Doctors with a conscientious objection must make sure patients have enough
information to exercise their right to see another doctor.
- Doctors may practice medicine in accordance with their beliefs, provided that they:
1. Do not treat patients unfairly.
2. Do not deny patients access to appropriate medical treatment of services.
3. Do not cause patients distress.
- You may opt out of providing a particular procedure because of your personal beliefs and values, but you must not refuse to treat:
- A particular patient or group of patients because of your personal beliefs or views about them.
- Health consequences of lifestyle choices to which you objects because of your beliefs.
- Not legally or professionally acceptable to discriminate against individual patients or groups of patients.
- In 2014 the Supreme Court ruled on the  scope of the right to conscientious objection, clarifying that the right to conscientious objection does not include the host of "ancillary, administrative and managerial tasks" that might be associated with abortion, such as supervising other healthcare practitioners involved in abortion care.
- It only includes the tasks involved in a "hands-on" capacity.

### Conscientious Objection

- Doctor sets own limits:
1. May choose to discuss/refer but not sign abortion form (HSA1 form).
2. May choose to opt out of referral to abortions after first trimester.
3. May choose not to refer as long as patient’s treatment not delayed.
- Doctor can change his/her mind.

# Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990

- This amended the 1967 Act by:
1. Imposing a general time limit of 24 weeks on abortions (most abortions are done by this time).
2. Introducing no time limit on abortions where there is a risk of:
- Death or serious permanent damage to the woman
- Serious fetal abnormality.
- On one hand, the decrease in general time limit from 28 to 24 weeks was seen as a tightening of the law.
- On the other hand, the introduction of no time limit for abortion in certain circumstances was seen as a liberalisation of the law.

---

# Gatekeeping Abortion

- UK legislation situates abortion as a medical issue concerning the pregnant person and their doctors.
- The law sets out no criteria for deciding when the conditions of the Abortion Act have been met.
- Decisions about the justifiability of particular abortions are left in the hands of individual doctors.
- The pregnant person's partner has no rights of veto, or even to be consulted.

---

# Legal and Moral Status of the Foetus

### Legal Status of the Foetus

- Foetus has no legal right to life until after birth regardless of gestation.
- Nothing can be done to protect a foetus from actions of a pregnant woman

### Moral Status of Foetus

- Pro-life: against women’s right to choose to have an abortion.
- Pro-choice: for women’s right to choose to have an abortion.
- Anti-choice/pro-life: foetus has equal moral status with adults
and full human rights
- Pro-choice: foetus has no (or limited) moral status and no (or
limited) human rights.

### Emotionally It is More Complex

- Both women and health professionals are affected by ↑ maturity of foetus.
- Reflected in law and professional guidance.
- Grounds for abortion > 24 weeks more limited:
- RCOG guidance on refusals of caesarean section
1. ‘A distressing situation, an avoidable tragedy’.
2. ‘Obstetricians must recognise dual claims of
mother and her foetus’.

### Law and Professional Guidance Recognise Moral Complexity of Abortion

- If a doctor believes a foetus is a human being with full human ;rights, being forced to participate in abortion care will severely compromise his/her conscience.
- Conscience clause in Abortion Act.

---

# Decriminalisation of Abortion

- Direct discrimination: when a person is treated less favourably than someone else in a comparable situation.
- Example: a doctor refuses to treat a patient on grounds of patient’s sexual orientation.
- Indirect discrimination: when a rule or policy that appears to apply equally to all in fact works to disadvantage some groups.
- Example: making healthcare information available only in written form might indirectly discriminate against those who can’t read or those with visual impairment.
- In 2017-2019, Medical bodies support the decriminalisation of abortion
- These include the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal College of Midwives, The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of GPs, amongst others.
- This is because they believe current UK law compromises good clinical care:
- The legal requirements for two doctors to authorise an abortion can cause unnecessary delays in treatment.
- Doctors’ focus on legal requirements can interfere with putting the patient first.
- Any legal requirement that specifies where abortion pills need to be taken limits women’s choices and can adversely impact their job / income / safety and the efficacy of the pills.
- The current law prevents nurses and midwives from being fully involved in abortion care, despite abortion care being the same clinical care that they give in miscarriage management.

---

# Northern Ireland

- In 2019, MPs voted in legislation that decriminalised abortion up to 12 weeks in Northern Ireland and imposed similar conditions to the 1967 Abortion Act after 12 weeks.

---

# Arguments for Decriminalisation of Abortion

- Arguments supporting decriminalisation argue that Criminalisation of Abortion:
1. Infringes women’s autonomy
    - The requirement that abortion is authorised by two doctors is contrary to the concept of patient autonomy
    - There is no other medical procedure that requires this level of scrutiny
    - The requirement that abortion pills are taken at the abortion clinic limits women’s choices
2. Contributes to abortion stigma
    - The use of criminal law in healthcare sends a message of strong social disapproval
3. Can be used to try to limit women’s access to abortion
    - By attacking abortion law in Parliament (over 40 attempts in the last 50 years)
    - By attacking doctors who provide abortions

---

# Arguments Against Decriminalisation

- These arguments claim that decriminalisation would:
1. Increase the number of abortions
- Including backstreet and self-induced abortions
1. Damage the reputation of the medical profession

And that the current abortion law:

- Protects the most innocent and vulnerable members of society (the fetus)
- Protects women from being coerced into having an abortion
- There is no evidence to suggest that decriminalising abortion leads to an increase in abortions, or number of abortions that happen at later gestation.
- In places where abortion has been decriminalised such as Canada, the rate of abortion remained the same as when it was a criminal offence.

---

# Pill-Mediated Abortions

- In addition to supporting the decriminalisation of abortion, medical organisations like the RCOG have campaigned to improve the accessibility of medical abortions and the experience of people who have them by altering the rules about where abortion pills can be taken.
- Medical abortions require two different types of pills to be taken 24h-48h apart.
- Under previous legislation, women were required to take both pills in clinic.
- This meant some women passed the pregnancy on the way home from the clinic, on the bus or in a cab. It also caused difficulties for many other women (e.g. due to distance from clinics, difficulty taking time off work, caring responsibilities, controlling partners), resulting in some people accessing abortion later in their pregnancy, continuing a pregnancy they didn't want or even sourcing abortion pills online - a criminal offence.

### 2018

- The use of the second abortion pill at home was legalised

### 2020

- In March 2020 the Secretary of State for Health temporarily approved women's home as a place in which both abortion pills can be taken, allowing the use of telemedicine for abortion care and reducing the need for women to come into clinic during the pandemic.
- This ruling lasts for 2 years or until the end of the pandemic.
- A public consultation (Dec 2020-March 2021) will inform the government on whether tele-medicine should be allowed to continue.
- Evidence has shown that telemedicine for abortion care is as safe and effective as face-to-face care and is appreciated by women and pregnant people.

# Religion and Abortion

### Catholicism

- The mere probability that the embryo is a person is sufficient for an absolute ban on the embryo’s deliberate destruction. Any treatment whose sole or primary intention is to end the pregnancy is prohibited.

### Orthodox Judaism

- Abortion is sanctioned when there is serious hazard to the woman’s physical or mental health. Abortion cannot be justified for social or financial reasons or because of the risk of serious fetal abnormality, the youth of the woman or the fact that a pregnancy results from rape.

### Church of England

- Abortion is sometimes necessary, but should only be undertaken after the most serious moral reflection. If possible we should create a caring climate in which real alternatives to abortion are available.

### Islam

- Kill not your children for fear of want (poverty). We shall provide sustenance for them as well as you. Verily the killing of them is a great sin. The woman’s life has more value than that of the fetus because she is established in life, with duties and responsibilities, and she is also regarded as a pillar of the family.

### Greek and Russian Orthodox Churches

- If a woman’s life is at risk through continuing with the pregnancy, a decision to have an abortion would be deemed necessary but unacceptable.

### Hinduism

- A slayer of an embryo is like the slayer of a priest. In an irredeemable situation, it is best to cause the miscarriage of the fetus, for no means must be neglected which can prevent the loss of the mother.

### Buddhism

- Meditation will probably result in the conclusion that an abortion would be taking life (but that) does not mean you are condemning people who do choose to have abortions.

### Liberal/Reform Judaism

- The woman’s husband should be included in the decision-making process, but ultimately it is the woman who should have final responsibility for deciding to end a pregnancy.

### Sikhism

- Think and think again about the reason for choosing abortion. It is important that abortion isn’t undertaken lightly and that there is a good reason for it, such as the health and welfare of the pregnant woman and also the greater good of the woman’s family.

### Methodist Church

- Abortion is sometimes the lesser of two evils … many embryos are lost to miscarriage and humans should not take a position of absolutism that nature itself does not observe. In the event that an embryo is grievously disabled, the pregnancy is a result of rape, or the mental or physical health of the woman is at risk, it is considered acceptable to end a pregnancy.

### Humanism

- Take happiness and suffering into consideration. It is more concerned with the quality of life than the right to life, if the two come into conflict and most would agree that safe, legal abortion should be available to women who choose it.

---

# Personhood

- The concept of personhood is fundamental to many people’s views about the moral permissibility of abortion.
- As a person we all have rights, which include the legal protection from harm. But when does personhood begin?
- The morality of abortion often depends on your view on this question. If, for example, you believe personhood begins at the moment of conception, abortion would *always* be morally wrong.
- On the other hand if you believe a fetus does not become a person until after birth then abortion may never be morally wrong.

---

# Abortion

- There is no legal right to abortion in the UK.
- Abortion has been a criminal offence in the UK since the nineteenth century (Offences Against the Person Act 1861).
- Woman can access an abortion if certain criteria are fulfilled in mainland UK (1967 Abortion Act).
- The 1990 Ammendment of the Human Abortion Act does not specify a criteria for deciding when a disability counts as serious enough for abortion to be justified
- The Fetus has no legal right to lie until after birth, regardless of Gestation
- Doctors have a legal and professional right to opt out of participating in abortion care:
1. As long as the woman can still access an abortion.
2. Unless one is needed to save life/prevent serious harm.
- This does not mean their duty of care is withdrawn but transferred for the procedure
- Denial of access to legal abortion services violates the rights to health, privacy, non-discrimination, and freedom from cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.

# Current UK Political Debate

### Abortion (Disability Equality) Bill 2017

- Lord Shinkwin Private Member’s Bill: House of Lords Committee Stage.

### Abortion (Decriminalisation) - Ten Minute Rule Bill March 2017

- Diana Johnson MP
- That leave be given to bring in a bill to amend sections 58 and 59 of Offences Against the Person Act 1861 to decriminalise consensual abortions.
