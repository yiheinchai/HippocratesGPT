# [CPP2032] Human Factors and Patient Safety

Module: PPICC

# Patient Safety

- Patient Safety = Coordinated Efforts to prevent harm, caused by the process of healthcare itself, from occurring to Patients AKA Reducing Iatrogenic Harm

# Human Factor Analysis

- This considers the interrelationship between the Individual, their equipment and the environment in which they use these tools.
- These aim to understand how people perform under different circumstances
- Ergonomics = Taking knowledge from Human Factor Analysis then aims to redesign the workplace to suit the people who use it
- There are 3 Domains of Human Factors:
1. **Organisational**
- This relates to aspects of an Organisation that influence employee's behaviour and reflects the Organisations' Culture
- This includes Staffing, Leadership and Supervision, Workload etc,
1. **Task** 
- This is the way that tasks are designed and how they fit with/use individual skills and available equipment
- These factors become most evident in emergency situations or when distractions arise that means that tasks are either done quickly/with little attention, where this lack of focus allows flaws to appear
- These include Supervision Level, Equipment Checks, Equipment Availability
1. **Individual**
- These are individual characteristics that influence an individual's behaviour (These can be constant like personality or can change over time like skills and attitudes)
- Examples include Knowledge + Competence, Motivation and Attitudes, Language and Culture, Stress etc.

# Stress

### Stress

- Yerkes-Dodson Law - There is a relationship between performance and arousal.
- Increased arousal can improve performance but only up to a certain point. Where arousal/stress are very low and excessively high, performance diminishes

# Human Errors

- Human Error = An inappropriate or undesirable human decision or behaviour that reduces or has the potential to reduce the effectiveness, safety or performance of an intervention.Â The unintended outcome may be an adverse event
- Active Errors = These tend to be incorrect actions (Patient Safety Incidents) that tend to have an immediate effect
- They include deviating from a protocol or systems check, miscommunication and errors of Judgement
- Latent Conditions = These are features of working that lay dormant until the risk is exposed by a combination of factors
- This includes a lack of equipment maintenance, staff shortages, inadequate training
- Often it is these Latent Conditions that when combined together, result in Active Errors by Clinicians
- However, Human error and a negative outcome are not inextricably linked
- E.g Complications can occur without an error taking place, Errors can have no consequences when recognised and corrected before harm occurs (Near Miss), Minor Errors with Large consequences (Patient Safety Incident/Serious Unintended Incident)

# Harm

- Generally, the Harm caused by Human Error goes far beyond the Px themselves.
- Human Errors can impact the Px's Family, Px trust in Drs, Society and the Reputation of the Dr/Profession and can have financial/legal impacts
- Due to the Duty of Candour, whenever an incident/Human Error occurs, you must apologise and explain what happened to the Px and/or their family
- Incident Reporting via Datix must also occur, which involves collecting and analysing information about near misses and critical incidents that impact anyone in the Organisation as a whole.
- The Trust then investigates how the error occurred and puts in barriers to prevent the same error from happening in the future
- These errors are reported nationally to the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS)
