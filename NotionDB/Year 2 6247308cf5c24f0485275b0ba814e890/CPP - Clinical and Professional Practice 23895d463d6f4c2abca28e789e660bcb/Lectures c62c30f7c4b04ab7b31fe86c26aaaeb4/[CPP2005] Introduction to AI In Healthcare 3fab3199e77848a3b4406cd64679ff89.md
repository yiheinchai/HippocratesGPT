# [CPP2005] Introduction to AI In Healthcare

Module: DDS

# Artificial Intelligence

- Any algorithm that performs a function instead of humans
- Machine Learning = Algorithm in question learns and improves each time that it performs its function
- Deep Learning = Neural Networks that lead to more sophisticated learning after performing a function/running an algorithm, often beyond human function
- Machine Learning could be used to improve the accuracy of the assessment of the rate and extent at which an individual will develop along a spectrum of disease.
- Traditional Risk Scores use a small number of factors to decide at which point an individual should receive a Tx, with these factors lacking any individual weighting of the risk factors and the result often having a poor predictive value (it is difficult to know which Px will best benefit from the transplant)
- Machine Learning considers more features, weighted on an individual to provide a personalised approach and gives a specific time window for when the Tx should take place, allowing for a better assessment of when a Px should get a Tx (Prognosis is still difficult to accurately assess)

# Healthcare for Patients

- Good Health Care for a Px includes:
1. Focus on Health Vs the Healthcare System
2. Universal
3. Evidence-Based
4. High Quality
5. Right Care, Time and Person

### Learning Health Systems

- Between the transition of knowledge from Science to Evidence, Scientific Insights can be poorly managed, leading to the loss of potentially useful information
- Between the transition of knowledge from Evidence to Care, Scientific Evidence from Research can be poorly utilised, leading to the loss of potentially useful information
- Between the transition of knowledge from Care to Px experience, there can be poor recording of Px experiences after the application of research/guidelines, leading to the loss of potentially useful information, resulting in a poor Px experience

- Learning Health Systems seek to minimise this loss of information by providing a continuous cycle of Science, Evidence and Care, with Pxs and Clinicians at the Centre

- Individual health records are combined to through EHRs to help produce Clinical Guidance, which supports Public Health Policy on a Population Level and Support individual clinical decision making

# Science Regarding the Use of AI

- Currently, AI is too inaccurate and variable (low reproducibility) for clinical medical use - This creates an AI Chasm between what individuals are saying and believing about the capabilities of AI and the realities of the usage of AI in medicine
- The main problem regarding the use of AI in medicine is poor quality data being fed into AI Algorithms, resulting in poor quality outcomes
- There has been concern with Medical AI technology being predominantly accessible to Non-Ethnic Minority, Higher Socioeconomic Status Pxs. Therefore, there has been concerns than widespread use of AI could exacerbate Socioeconomic divides/inequalities already seen in medicine
- However, regarding the use of Machine Learning, there are no studies recording the effectiveness or cost effectiveness the application of Machine Learning
- Some reviews that have suggested the benefits of the incorporation of AI into daily clinical practice (Less Spending etc.) but there are doubt about the credibility of these report due to conflicts of interest of authors and a lack of clinicians producing the report

# Using AI In Medicine

- In order to use AI in Healthcare, Drs need sufficient training, transparency in its usage, the technology must be Px-Centred and clinical credibility regarding the accuracy of its use
- Currently, there is little training for Drs and Med Students regarding AI and Digital Healthcare, meaning that the work force is unable to effectively use AI and benefit from it
- Lack of Transparency regarding the use of AI in medicine has led to a lack of trust in AI, meaning clinicians and Px are less likely to use it, meaning it is less likely to be incorporated into daily clinical practice

---

# Summary

- The balance is in favour of AI being 'over-hyped' rather than 'under-used' at the presence, highlighted by the AI Chasm
- Currently, the usage of AI is halted by Inadequate Data being fed into algorithms, Ineffective evaluation of AI in healthcare, insufficient training of Px and Clinicians and a lack of transparency in culture regarding the use of AI in healthcare
- In order for AI to be more incorporated in clinical use, AI must become representative of all individuals, Evidence must transition from reductionist (considering one pathology) to holistic and the care provided by AI must be Px-Centred and Data-Guided vs Data-Driven and Tech-Centred
