Module: Mental Health

# Why is Perinatal Mental Health Important?

- 20% of women will experience a mental health issue in the perinatal period yet only 50% of women receive help or diagnosis
- This is likely due to a lack of availability of specialist support regarding perinatal mental health issues and due to stigma and expectations of women to have ideal body, ‘regain’ a good physique and to always be positive during the Perinatal period, giving rise to shame
- Poor Maternal Wellbeing can impact the mother by leading to:
1. Suicide → Leading cause of direct deaths for women during the perinatal period, with Domestic Abuse being involved in 50% of these
2. Physical health difficulties
3. Employment difficulties
4. Interpersonal relationship problems
5. Reduced care-giving capacity → Hence impacts the child
- Poor Maternal Wellbeing can impact the child and lead to:
1. Premature or still birth
2. Congenital malformations
3. Lower IQ and educational attainment
4. Attachment difficulties
5. Poor emotional wellbeing (predisposition to mental health issues)
6. Poor physical wellbeing
7. Long-term development impact
- Poor Maternal Wellbeing can impact the Partner and lead to:
1. Child development impact
2. Emotional and physical wellbeing
3. Domestic abuse perpetration
