# Pain

### Pain is Ubiquitous

- We have many fleeting and very minor pains every day.
- Many of these we deal with and hardly register consciously.
- Others we override because they are means to an end or familiar/expected (carrying a heavy bag, having an inoculations, sports and exercise etc.)
- We can do it because pain has no threat in it.
- In clinical settings, pain is almost always threatening.

### Pain in Inpatients

- Survey of UCLH inpatients with pain in last 3 months.
- Surveyed on a single day.
- 50% had pain.
- Pain was worst in those with cancer and long term conditions and least for those with postoperative pain.
- Worse pain is associated with poorer healing, longer hospital stay, sleep problems, distress etc.
- 10-14% of UK adults have moderately to severely disabling chronic pain. More in older adults, so expected to ↑.

### Definition

- “An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage”.
- Because this is subjective, pain is often denied in those who cannot tell us about it (non-verbal children and adults, elderly
people with dementia, non-human animals).
- Pain cannot be confirmed or denied by the presence or absence of tissue damage or pathophysiology so the Px is the authentic reported of the presence or absence of pain
- If there is no verbal report of pain, you have to infer its presence from behaviours (often facial expressions) which act as distinct pain indication
- It is also denied in those who are judged to be unreliable in reporting their symptoms: women, people from ethnic minorities, people with little education, people with psychological or psychiatric disorders.
- But they have pain just like anyone else, creating serious inequities in health care (E.g women presenting with Chest Pain are less likely to get ECG Taken and appropriate care and get sent home, when they might be in an active heart attack).
- Therefore, when discussing pain, try to focus discussions with Px about methods of controlling pain vs finding a cause of pain when it is not present (The latter can lead to frustration)

### Functions

- Demands attention
- Prioritises escape
- Once away from the Noxious Stimulus it promotes recovery and healing: by energy conservation, vigilance, defence, often by limiting function in the affected area
- Teaches us to avoid it in future, by attending and learning associated cues.
- It is an alarm system, set to avoid false negatives which means it can sometimes cause false positives
- It is also aversity, motivating escape, defence and recovery to provide us the best protection for society
- None of these functions requires pain intensity to match tissue damage, it just needs to be present to produce responses (It is not correlated with extent of tissue damage).
- Even very simply organisms (bacteria, simple multicellular animals) have nociception and move away from aversive stimuli.
- Pain responses (escape, guarding, limping, avoidance) have been demonstrated in crustaceans and in fish, reversed by local anaesthetic or opioids.

# Experimental Evidence

### Animal Models and Pain

- Following reasons make it difficult to extrapolate from animal studies to human clinical pain, even though many mechanisms are shared.

### Animal Research

- Animals often unconscious and/or restrained.
- Restricted behavioural options, little spontaneous behaviour to noxious stimuli.
- Lesions may not have equivalent in human clinical pain.
- Most studies of peripheral lesions, not central processing as it is easier to detect activity at the periphery than centrally.
- We have to infer anxiety, depression etc. from behaviour. Animal’s experience is inaccessible to us.

### Human Clinical Pain

- Conscious and able to report aspects of experience.
- Many psychological influences on central processing.
- Most clinical problems involve chronic changes in central sensitisation, not acute peripheral lesions.
- Sensitisation, not acute peripheral lesions.

### Facial Expression

- Mice show empathy to littermates, not to strange mice, when they are in pain, and themselves become sensitised to pain

# Pain Transmission and Modulation

- Gate control (Melzack and Wall): describes balance at 1st synapses, between:
1. Fast and slow (A and C) fibres from periphery or organs.
2. Descending fibres from brain.
- This allows CNS activities subserving attention, emotion and memories of prior experience to exert control over the sensory input
- Gate control theory inspired new field of research, resulting in description of:
1. Excitatory (amplifying) as well as inhibitory mechanism.
2. Mediation of pain transmission by endorphins.
3. Central sensitisation at dorsal horn neurones amplify incoming signals from A and C fibres.
4. CNS and cortical plasticity in response to pain signals.
- After injury, there is peripheral and central sensitisation.

### Plasticity in Pain Systems

- Supraspinal Level → There is modulation and modification of nociceptive and anti-nociceptive synaptic transmission

### Involvement of Spinal Cord in Placebo Response

- Eippert et al 2011
- “Our data provide direct evidence that psychological factors can influence nociceptive processing at the earliest stage of the central nervous system, namely the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.
- They also reveal that one mechanism of placebo analgesia is inhibition of spinal cord nociceptive processing, possibly mediated by the descending pain control system in a gate-control manner.

### After Hand Amputation

- After hand is amputated, regions of the Cortex corresponding to the Face expand to occupy the previous hand areas of the Brain

### After Hand Amputation and Hand Transplantation

- After hand transplantation, there is regression of the enlarged face area back to its original size and location as the hand region begins to reform and occupy its original territory

# Brain-Gut Axis and Pain Processing

### Brain-Gut Axis

- CNS and enteric nervous system (bidirectional interactions).
- Brain receives information from GI tract, integrates it with other interoceptive information and with context.
- Dysregulation affects interoception (sensations inside the body), sensitivity to visceral information, gut motility, immune function, emotion to increase sensation to visceral sub-threshold stimulation.
- These changes are seen in IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) and endometriosis, likely in bladder pain, vulval pain, prostate pain.

### Brain Areas Involved in Pain Processing

- Activation in spinal cord, thalamus, S1 and S2, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (divisions vary), prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, posterior parietal cortex, basal ganglia, brainstem.
- Neurosignature: never exactly same, no unique area or path corresponding to pain.

### Structural and Functional Changes in Brains of People with Chronic Pain

- Changes in activation patterns are seen both in people with disease-related pain (e.g. RA), with central sensitisation and with functional pain problems.
- Descending modulatory system is dysfunctional:
- Inhibitory system is underactive.
- Descending facilitator system is overactive.
- PFC (prefrontal cortex) is site of cell death in chronic pain patients.
- Opioid binding to opioid receptor sites in spinal cord is less efficient.
- Dopaminergic system also functions abnormally.
- Chronic pain as a disease rather than a syndrome as it is unrelated to its original cause in pathophysiological changes.

# Typologies of Pain

- Causes of pain: mostly acquired, some heritable.
- Acquired pain:
- Metabolic: e.g. chronic renal failure.
- Endocrine: e.g. diabetes.
- Infective: e.g. shingles.
- Structural/degenerative: e.g. tumour, ageing.
- Toxic: e.g. alcohol.
- Vitamin deficiency: e.g. vitamin B12.
- Trauma: e.g. surgery, radiation.

### Acute and Chronic/Persistent Pain

- Acute pain mostly:
- Has identifiable cause and mechanism.
- Resolves with healing/recovery.
- Responds to treatment if available.
- Chronic pain mostly:
- Has less clear cause, no ongoing pathology/injury.
- Mechanism may help guide treatment.
- Responds variably to treatment.
- Is influenced in magnitude and functional impairment by psychological factors which need addressing.
- Psychological distress and acute pain intensity predict development into chronic pain (from injury, surgery, illness etc.)
- Depression probably predicts the development of most chronic pains in a non-specific way, mediated by early management

### Pain in Europe

- Risk factors: genetic, demographic (age, sex), psychosocial (e.g. anxiety), pain (preoperative, postoperative), clinical (e.g. chemotherapy), surgical (nerve injury)
- Can intervene to ↓ risk: psychosocial, pain.
- Milder pain may reduce or remit overtime whilst moderate to severe pain persists

# Pain and Psychology

### Psychological Models

| Psychodynamic Model and Psychosomatic Model | Pain invoke unconscious processes, weak
theory and largely without evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Personality Models (Some people are more prone to pain and/or handle/cope with it poorly) | Much tested but little support |
| Behavioural Models | Rewards, punishment, learning responses in regards to pain.
Theoretically and empirically strong,
clinically better combined with other
models. |
| Cognitive Models (Focus what people think about their pain and what conclusions/cognitive responses arise due to pain) | Theoretically and empirically supported, now trying to integrate psychological with (imaged) brain processes. |
| Integrated Biopsychosocial Models | Ideal but hard to achieve in research or clinical practice. |

# Pain and Threat

### Pain is Threathening

- Difficult or impossible to ignore (depending on intensity).
- Interrupts thoughts and behaviour.
- Processing takes priority: processing is informed by beliefs, fears, state of mind etc.
- Demands action to escape it, or to minimise it: those actions are informed by beliefs, fears, state of mind etc.
- Those functions are hard-wired, so pain will always grab attention, but we have some control over what happens next.
- That is where changing unhelpful beliefs and biases in thinking and ↓ anxiety can make a difference by enabling people to rapidly shift focus away from pain.
- When healthy subjects had repeated laser stimuli to the foot, with some told the stimulus would be low or high threat, those who received ‘high threat’ reported more pain and increased activation within the Anterior Insula and Cingulate Cortex (Different Processing but same stimulus)
- This means that threat means more attention and resources are given to the processing of pain and hence, increase its perceived magnitude

### Catastrophising

- Focus on a threat, that is overestimated whilst the Px underestimates the resources available to them to deal with it
- Health subjects: Catastrophising predicts pain intensity and tolerance.
- Acute stage: predicts chronicity and disability level later.
- Catastrophising preoperatively predicted development of chronic postsurgical pain.
- Threat values can be reduced by normalising the experience and/or by explaining phenomena which are the subject of the Catastrophising
- Px can be helped to recognise limitations of medical fixes and reconnected with his/her own resources, engaging the Px in their own pain management to allow them to deal with pain better
- Chronic pain: predicts mood and behaviours.
- Catastrophising predicted disability and treatment efficacy in lower back pain.
- Chronic Pain is often associated with Depressive beliefs

# Pain Assessment and Expression

### Pain Assessment

- Self-report: interview, questionnaire. Only detects what is conscious and not self-censored.
- Physiological correlations: heart rate, blood pressure. None are specific to pain or pain relief.
- Brain processing correlates: fMRI, MEG etc. Not specific to pain, challenging to interpret and costly.
- Behaviour: expression, return to normal activity, stopping analgesics. But also many other influences.
- Rate severity of your pain: none, mild, moderate, severe, very severe.
- Simple verbal or numerical scales are most reliable: 0-10 for no pain to extreme pain.
- There is a good correlation between brain activity in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex and S1 (as detected by fMRI) and the subjective rating of pain reported by Px - This means that Subjective Pain Rating are reliable measures of pain

### Behavioural Pain Expression

- Non-verbal behaviour: face and body - The magnitude of which are influenced by the social context in which an individual is in.
- Changes in movement and posture may ↓ pain or prevent worsening (protective) and are largely controllable, though shared with many other animals.
- They are observable so they communicate.
- Facial expression has no protective function, it is communicative.
- Warns those who see it: benefit.
- May elicit help: benefit.

### Pain Assessment and Action

- Common for healthcare staff not to ask about pain, or not to act on it when patient reports pain, or to give an analgesic but not check that it has worked, or what other help they could give.
- Many staff believe that most patients exaggerate pain so discount patient report.
- Assessment: best to ask patient. Record using standard scale.
- Treatment: prescribe as appropriate, then reassess the pain and act if necessary to reduce pain.
- This address anxiety and encourage patient to take some control.

# Treatment

### Aims

- Improve control of pain.
- Help build realistic model of problem.
- Correct over-negative expectations of decline and disability
- Aim towards restoring normal lifestyle again, working towards short and long term goals via graded steps
- Address distress and promote understanding of pain in family, friends, employer etc.
- ↓ unhelpful encounters with health systems
- Focussing on pain alone may leave patient inactive and anxious about the possible effect of increasing strain on body by attempting to return back to normal lifestyle.
- But focussing on distress and activity without efforts to relieve pain makes patient feel disbelieved and uncared for.
- Psychological and Non-Pharmacological Analgesics (E.g CBT and Exercise, Mindfulness) can be as effective as drugs like Opioids and Anti-Depressants without Long Term effects of Chronic Usage

# Summary

- Pain always has a psychological component: contributes to what patient feels and what he/she presents to you.
- Patients with pain want you to:
1. Find out and treat anything wrong.
2. Explain why they have pain, particularly if nothing is found in investigation.
3. Advise them what is and isn’t safe to do.
4. Help ↓ pain as far as possible.
5. Help improve their quality of life despite pain.
