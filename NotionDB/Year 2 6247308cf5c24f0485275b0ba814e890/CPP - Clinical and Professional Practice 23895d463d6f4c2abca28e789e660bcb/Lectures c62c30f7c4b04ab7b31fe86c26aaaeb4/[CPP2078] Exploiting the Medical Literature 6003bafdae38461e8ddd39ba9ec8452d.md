# [CPP2078] Exploiting the Medical Literature

Module: DDS

# Sources of Online Medical Literature

- When looking for online medical information, ensure the information is:
1. Authoritative - From a reliable institution/charity/individual and not biased
2. Current
3. Related to Other Work in the Field
4. Accessible in Full Text - Ensures you can access the original study to assess its quality
- The quality of online medical information can be determined by looking at:
1. What was searched - Many academic papers are behind a firewall and so not picked up by Google
2.  How many results - It is better to have fewer, more focused results
3. How are the results ranked

# Journals and Databases

### Journals

- Academic Journals are the main source for published primary research (Surveys, RCTs, Case Studies), where new data is gathered to form original studies
- They provide high quality academic information that is relevant and up to date
- However, you still need to evaluate the information you read in them as unlike Secondary Sources (reviews etc.), they have not been pre-appraised
- Journals tend to be very focused and specific, including various types of studies
- Peer Review processes should ensure the quality of published studies as before publication, articles are evaluated by academic experiences in the field and subject to rigorous checks
- Journals often only publish information on rare or new conditions, Rx etc. and are published on a regular basis and so, are up to date

### Databases

- The most efficient way to search journals = Bibliographic Database
- These contain references to peer-reviewed journal articles, as well as reviews, reports etc.
- They serve as the main gateway to search for Journal Articles
- They allow users to search for specific articles using an interface that allows you to control how they search
- They have a search history function
- They are usually integrated with a full-text version of the article, where available

# Identifying Concepts, Textword and Thesaurus Searching

- Start by using a clearly defined research question
- Next, identify the key concepts of the question using PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome)
- Next, consider synonyms/alternative terms for the key concepts
- Truncation - Consider words with different endings but the same root in searches.
- This is done by searching Root* (E.g Cannab* = Cannabis, Cannabinoids etc.)
- If you truncate words too early, you could end up retrieving irrelevant results
- Truncation is used in Textword Searching
- Textword Search using matching exact patterns of letters to ignore irrelevant terms to produce search results (Matches specific words).
- This can be limited in effectiveness when words are ambiguous or when there are many ways to describe the same concept (Textword Search might miss relevant term)
- For comprehensive searches you should use thesaurus searching, searching through an index of terms within a database
- Thesaurus searches ensure you do not have to think of all possible searches and variant spellings when searching for concepts
- By using both textword and thesaurus searches, you have the greatest chance of finding all materials on a topic

# Boolean Operators

- OR Operator - Combines searches to show all articles that show terms from Search 1 or Search 2 or Both Terms
- Using OR produces a larger set of results and should be used for searching variants on the same concept
- AND Operator - Finds only articles containing both Search 1 and Search 2 Terms
- Using AND produces a smaller set of more focused results and should be used to combine two or more different concepts
- Search strategies can be built from the database's search history, and by adding more concepts

# Databases

- Results produced can be narrowed down even further by using predefined limits found in the database such as:
1. Publication Year
2. Language
3. Document Type
4. Age Group
5. Human or Animal Studies

Types of Databases:

1. Medline Via Ovid - Biomedicine. Covers wide range of clinical professions and preclinical sciences.
2. Pubmed - Biomedical journal articles and is updated daily
3. Web of Science - No Thesaurus/MeSH like Medline and Pubmed so only Textword searching can occur. It includes cited reference searching (you can see the references cited by the paper in its reference list and subsequent papers that have cited the paper of interest)
