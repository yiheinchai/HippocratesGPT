# [CPP2004] Justice, Ethnicity and Health

Module: Professionalism

# Age UK Camden

- Provide activities for elderly with additional needs and have communication with HCPs in Hospitals
- Used to be free but Since 2012,  you have to pay based on income and savings etc. And must be referred by HCPs or Social Care
- Health Care Vs Social Care - Social Care is not centralised whereas Health Care is centralised. Health Care is free for all whilst social care is not. Health Care is accessible to all whereas Social Care is only accessible via Referral
- When communicating with elderly individuals, important to ensure that meaning is conveyed and that Px has time to process information
- This often involves speaking louder and slower, using non-verbal communication and also speaking in layman’s/simple terms to explain any concepts
- Important to consider language barriers and altered competency in what the most effective modes of communication are

# Safeguarding

- Best way to safeguard the elderly is to work in collaboration with the other organisation that are providing care/supporting the individual within health care, social care and other organisations that support the individual (E.g transport etc.)
- This allows for continuous and seamless care to be provided to the Px without any lapses
- Mental Capacity should be assessed if there is any reason/evidence to suggest that they are not mentally competent
- Lower Rate for Complex Care need to attend a Day Centre - £40 for Lower Rate and £65 for Higher Rate

# Case Study

- Many elderly individuals may feel very comfortable in Hospitals and be reluctant to go home due to loneliness at home, making them feel reluctant to go home
- Try to use family before professionals for translation
- Px says need to be optimistic as a Dr, some people can be dangerous and they can attack you - Said by Andrew Constandas (Lost house due to family stealing his house and changing his locks while he went to the shops) - Lots of focus on protecting oneself and how others can harm you. Long term impacts of family’ actions on Andrew and his general trust, even with Drs and others
- Very religious and lots of trust and faith in God - Perhaps he has lost trust in people because of what has happened and now, puts faith in higher power that will not do him wrong
- Drs are often last resort so if Px comes to you, always take them seriously and do not judge them or assume that their questions/issues are trivial - Only can be determined trivial by clinical examination/objective means
- Px repeating things over and over does not automatically mean they are senile or lack capacity, this could merely be the Px stressing the importance of what they are saying and feeling that they need to repeat it over and over to be heard as they have been previously dismissed - Therefore, do not be judgemental and do not assume that elderly = senile
- It is important to do a risk assessment before discharging someone to ensure they have the adequate support systems around them (Family, Carers, Safe Environment at Home, Access to Facilities etc.) to ensure that the Px is able to heal and recover properly
