# [CPP2077] Health and Sustainability - Matters of Life and Death

Module: SDoH

# Population

- Since the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions, Population Size has increased exponentially
- GDP per capita has also shown a similar stagnant rising phase, followed by a rapid exponential growth phase, but this exponential growth occurred later than the Population growth and has been increasing at a greater rate than population growth
- This increase in GDP is attributed to an increased usage of resources that has led to massive environmental pressures via increased usage of environmental resources (E.g Animals, Fish and Land Destruction)
- Water usage has also increased significantly over the year, which is now far greater than Liquid Fresh Water, meaning that groundwater and fossil aquifers must now be used to meet these water needs
- Over time, Increased Agriculture to meet food and energy demands has led to the gradual depletion of topsoil and hence, loss of Soil Fertility

# Future of Humanity and Disease

- Due to increased Climate Change and reduced Soil Viability, the planet is becoming less and less habitable over time
- This means that Climate Change is the greatest health threat of the 21st Century
- As Global Temperature and Humidity Increases, the geographical area in Vector Bourne diseases carried by Insects like Mosquitos can be found is increasing
- This has led to Dengue cases rapidly increasing over time

---

# Flood

- Climate Warming has led to increased flooding/rising sea levels and reduced Sea and Land Ice Levels
- Dansgaard-Oeschger Event - any of several dramatic/rapid climate fluctuations characterized by a period of abrupt warming followed by a period of slow cooling, leading to rapid net ice loss
- Previously, warming was mainly focused in the North Pole but recently, ice and hence, land mass loss and heating has spread to the South Pole

---

# Flame

- Due to drying out of land masses due to Increased Global Temperature, the frequency of Fires has increased, in widespread areas of the planet

---

# Famine

- There is increased Famine worldwide due to destruction of habitats of animals that are used as food sources but also due to reduced Soil Viability for crops
- This reduced food ability has led to rising food costs, which further contributes to famine

---

# Fighting

- Due to Climate Change and increased overutilisation of Natural Resources, planetary stability has decreased over time, so that there is reduced capacity for the earth to house the rapidly increasing population
- This has led to conflict where individuals are fighting over natural resources required for the development of populations and infrastructure or where individuals have had to migrate to new countries to find viable land that is already occupied by a population
- Earlier Springs (Leading to Greater Pollen Release), Increasing [Ground Level Ozone] and Heat Waves (and subsequent fires that occur as a result) has led to increased Incidence of Respiratory Disease
- Increased Ground Level Ozone and Heatwaves has also led to an increased incidence of CVD
- Increased Flooding (Due to High Rainfall Events and Rising Sea Levels) and Algal Blooms increases the Incidence of Chemical Poisoning
- Increased Bacterial Diseases lead to increased incidence of Diarrhoea

# Action

- Currently, the technology required to decarbonise world power generation is available
- There is also enough to money circulating to decarbonise world power generation
- There are also economic benefits to low carbon lifestyles, improving diets and encouraging healthier transport modes like walking and Cycling
- Also, cleaner air due to less Fossil Fuel Consumption also produces health benefits
- This means that decarbonising energy systems provides health benefits that in turn reduce healthcare expenditure
- Hence, decarbonising energy systems isnâ€™t a technological or economic issue but rather, a political one
- This issue arises as National Politicians are hesitant on including Climate Change policy in their Manifestos as this does not attract many votes
- Moreover, the Public argues that if Politicians will not produce Climate Change legislation and Businesses will not provide the means to reduce Carbon Footprints, they become powerless to help improve the Climate Situation
- In addition, Business are reluctant to make steps to counter climate change as there is limited Public and Political and if changes were to be enacted, Businesses would likely set up Sites in Decarbonised Countries where previous infrastructure adapted to Carbon Energy Sources can still be used efficiently
- On an International Level, National Politicians are reluctant to invest in Decarbonising Energy Sources as this is likely to disadvantage one nation in comparison to another country that has not Decarbonised their Energy Sources

# How To Counteract Climate Change

1. Climate Change Legislation
2. Interacting with Individuals and Businesses to create a permissive environment that can move towards decarbonisation
