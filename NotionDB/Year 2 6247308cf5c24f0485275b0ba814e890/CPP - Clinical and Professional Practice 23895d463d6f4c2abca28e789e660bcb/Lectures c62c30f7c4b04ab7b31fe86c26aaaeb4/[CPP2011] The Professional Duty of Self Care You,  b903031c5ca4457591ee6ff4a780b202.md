# [CPP2011] The Professional Duty of Self Care: You, Your Patients and Substance Misuse

Module: PPICC

# Substance Abuse and the NHS

- GMC - Doctors have a professional duty to 'encourage patients and the public to take an interest in their health and to take action to improve and maintain'
- Levels of Alcohol and Drug Use in the UK have been growing, most clearly seen in the homeless
- There has been a move towards high alcohol drinks (spirits, wine etc.)
- Most damage to individuals and society comes from less visible or extreme patterns of drinking and drug use
- Substance Abuse has had a large financial toll on the NHS (Due to its contributions to ASB, Loss of Productivity etc.)and has made significant contributions to mortality and morbidity (and A&E visits)

# Responses to Substance Abuse

- Conflicts may arise when Px with acute/chronic effects of substance misuse are treated by Students or Drs with very judgemental attitudes towards Substance Misuse
- A wide variety of factors (Social, Cultural/Religious and Personal) might influence our attitudes to Px with Substance Misuse Problems:
1. Personal Background and Life Experiences (Personal or Professional)
2. Religion or Cultural Norms
3. Experience of Alcohol or Drug Use Problems in a Family Member
4. Own drug and alcohol use
5. Ability to tolerate ambiguity/uncertainty
6. Misinformation and a lack of knowledge
7. The Media

# Doctors and Substance Abuse

- Doctos may cause harm to their Px by prescribing medicines that can cause Iatrogenic Addiction (E.g Opiate Analgesics, Benzodiazepines, Gabapentinoids), leading to increased tolerance to these medications over time and physical withdrawal Sx if the Px stops taking the medication
- Iarogenesis = Inadvertent adverse effect resulting from medical treatment or advice
- Students and Doctors are at a higher risk of developing Alcohol and Drug Misuse than most other groups of professionals

# Fitness to Practice

- All medical schools have these and they are based on the GMC Model
1. The Deanery is contacted and informed on the matter
2. There is an initial FTP hearing to gather information (The Individual would give a report to a panel), leading to the panel requesting further information (Clinical Investigations
3. Following further hearings, decisions will be made on whether the individual needs to seek treatment (If this is the case with a student, the person will be suspended, with the suspension being reviewed if the person is progressing in their treatment)
4. If the person of interest is a Dr, the Dr is usually suspended from practice for a set period of time, during which the person should seek treatment whilst an investigation is undertaken
- If you see a Dr about Alcohol or Drug Misuse as a consequence of the FTP Panel, anything shared with the Dr is also shared with the FTP Panel
- Substance Misuse cases can be dealt with via a Health or Disciplinary Pathway (or both)
- The overriding concern is to protect Pxs and there is support afterwards for Students or Drs to regain their Fitness to Practice
- If a Medical Student or Dr has a history of Drug Misuse, restrictions may be placed on which specialities the Dr can practice, due to easy access to drugs in their fields (E.g A&E, GP, Anaesthetics, ICU)
