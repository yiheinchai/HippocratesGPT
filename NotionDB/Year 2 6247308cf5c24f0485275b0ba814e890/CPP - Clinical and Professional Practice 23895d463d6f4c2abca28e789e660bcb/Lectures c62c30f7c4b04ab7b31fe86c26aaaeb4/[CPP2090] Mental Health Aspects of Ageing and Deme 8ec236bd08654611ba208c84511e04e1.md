# [CPP2090] Mental Health Aspects of Ageing and Dementia

Module: Mental Health

# Brain Changes in Ageing

### Biological

- Structural:
1. Reduction of Brain Volume with Age, notably the Prefrontal Cortex
2. Loss of Cells in Grey or White Matter can reduce the magnitude and speed of connectivity between different regions of the Brain 
- Neurochemical:
1. Reduced DA Synthesis and Dopamine Receptor Expression
2. Reduced 5-HT and Glutamate, which may produce Behavioural Changes
- Genetic:
1. Cumulative Oxidative DNA Damage within the Brain which can lead to Neuronal Death and impact learning and memory

### Neuropsychological

- Ageing is characterised by a decline in Memory, attention, orientation and language, but are not so significant that they would impair day to day functional ability
- Studies show that are overall differences in the rate and magnitude of this decline between and within different groups of Elderly individuals, causing wide variation amongst the elderly population
- ‘Cognitive reserve’ - This is the resistance of Cognitive Change/Loss of Functionality despite brain damage and can be used to explain why if 2 Px have the same Neurological Pathology, there can be a wide different in the Cognitive Deficits seen
- Cognitive Reserve can be influenced by Individual (E.g Genetic, Education) and Environmental Factors
- Some studies show that Ageing Adults show a Positivity Effect where adults are more likely to remember positive vs negative information, likely due to better emotional regulative ability with age
- Psychoanalytic Theories are a group of Psychological Theories that originated from Freud that believe that everyone has unconscious thoughts and feelings that influence their current, conscious actions
- Erik Erikson’s Stage Theory of Psychosocial Development, Comprised of 8 Stages from Infancy to Adulthood, where each stage is characterised by 2 conflicting Psychosocial Forces which may/may not resolve at each stage
- For Adults > 60, he suggested that 2 Conflicting Forces were Ego Integrity and Dispair - This is because as Px reflect on their life, they develop feelings of Contentment and Integrity (If they believe they lived a happy, productive life) or Dispair (If they believe they did not have a productive life AKA lots of unachieved goals)

### Social Changes - NYC

- There are differences in attitudes towards ageing and death across cultures, often quite negative changes in Western Cultures (Sees Changes as a Loss)
- Role change - E.g Retirement or Carer for Elderly Spouse
- Age prejudice/discrimination against Elderly Individuals can lead elderly adults to see themselves ageing as Negative
- This may contribute to social segregation between age groups
- Narrowed social networks and Loneliness due to separation from Family and reduced social inclusion (Associative with Negative Mental and Physical Health Outcomes)
- Changes in financial situation

# Mental Health Disorders

- Older adults experience similar mental health conditions as those in younger adults (Depression, anxiety, psychosis etc.) but may have different risk factors, triggers and management due to biopsychosocial differences between these 2 groups.
- According to the WHO (2017), the most common mental health conditions in older people (>60 years) globally are (from most to least common):
1. Depression
2. Dementia
3. Anxiety
4. Substance misuse

### Depression in Older Adults

- Diagnosed in the same way in Older as in Younger Adults
- Anhedonia + Dysphoria and 3-4 other Sx in the Preceeding 2 Weeks = Major Depressive Episode
- Biological Factors = Chronic Disease, Pain, Brain Disorders
- Psychological Factors = Hx of Depression (Most Episodes of Depression in Elderly = Recurrence rather than First Episode)

### Differences in Depression in Older and Younger Adults

1. More difficult to identify - Sx may overlap with those of existing Physical Conditions or Normal Ageing (So Sx are attributed to those Vs Depression)
2. Late life depression associated with increased risk of dementia
3. Presentation?
- More likely to co-present with anxiety (50%), cognitive and functional impairment
- Somatisation (Psychological Sx Manifest as Physical Sx), hypochondriasis (Excessive Worry that an individual has a serious illness despite reasssurance of the contrary), psychomotor agitation or retardation, psychosis
- Older Adults have an Increased risk of suicide and more likely to complete suicide than Younger Adults

### Depression and Dementia

- Late Life Depression is associated with an increased risk of Dementia and therefore, Px with Dementia are up to 8x more likely to develop Depressive Sx in the 10 years preceeding the Clinical Dx of Dementia
- Px with Recurrent Depressive Sx from Early in Life do not have an increased risk of Dementia but those with Depressive Sx that presented later in life had an increased risk of Dementia
- Late Life Depression may be an Early Sx for the Onset of Dementia or Late Life Depression and Dementia may have common causes and hence, commonly copresent
- Therefore, Whilst Late Life Depression is a risk factor for Dementia, Early Life Depression is not

# Very late Onset Schizophrenia-Like Psychosis

- Very Similar to Schizophrenia seen in Young Adults but is called Late onset variant of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis if Sx occur for first time in Adults > 60 years old and no other underlying causes of the Sx have been identified.
- Prevalence: 3rd Most Commonly Dx Elderly MH Condition after Dementia and Depression (annual incidence 27 per 100,000 men and 48 per 100,000 women).
- Risk factors:
1. Female sex (4x adj risk in Females) unlike Schizophrenia in Young Adults where Males are more likely to be affected
2. Increasing age (↑ by 11% for every 5 yrs >60 years)
3. Sensory impairment (hearing > visual) - Risk factor in both Young and Old Onset
4. Social isolation  - Risk factor in both Young and Old Onset
5. Migrant status (older adults from Caribbean, comparable to early onset SCZ) - Risk factor in both Young and Old Onset
6. No Genetic Link unlike Young Onset Schizophrenia (Relatives of someone with VLOSP have a lower genetic risk of SCZ than those with an earlier illness onset)
- Treatment: Antipsychotic medication (low dose)

### Diagnosis

- Diagnosed via Exclusion Criteria (E.g Ruling out other causes until VLOSP is the only remaining Dx) as it has no Pathognomonic Signs

![Untitled](%5BCPP2090%5D%20Mental%20Health%20Aspects%20of%20Ageing%20and%20Deme%208ec236bd08654611ba208c84511e04e1/Untitled%201.png)

### Phenomenology Vs Schizophrenia

- Overlap with early-onset schizophrenia - positive symptoms (persecutory and paranoid delusions)
- But, in Late-Onset Schizophrenia:
1. Partition delusions more common
2. Complex visual, tactile, and non-verbal auditory hallucinations more common
3. Negative symptoms (E.g Lack of Motivation, Social Engagement) uncommon <5%
4. Personality remains intact and there is no flattening of affect

### Phenomenology

- Partition Delusion = Where Px believes they are being watched /overheard through partition (E.g Ceiling, Wall or Floor)
- These can be Human or Non-Human Intruders through the Partitions that are overhearing/watching Px and sometimes, Px may experience Somatic (including Sexual) effects

# Dementia

- According to the WHO (2017), the number of people with dementia worldwide in 2015 is projected to triple by 2050
- Alzheimer’s Disease is the most common type of Dementia - Affects 60-80% of Cases
- Px with Dementia can still experience the same MH conditions as those without Dementia but if these Sx occur after a Dx of Dementia has been made, these MH Illnesses are generally seen to be occurring Secondary to Dementia rather than being a Primary Diagnosis
- Therefore, these MH Sx are often classified as BPSD (Behavioural and Psychological Sx in Dementia) or Neuropsychiatric Sx of Dementia
- There is evidence that these BPSD are in fact secondary to the Neuropathological Changes seen in Dementia, notably with these Sx occurring in Phases over time and being positively correlated to the degree of Pathology seen in a Px with Alzheimer’s Disease (E.g Which Braak Stage they are)
- Typically in Alzheimer’s Disease, Mood and Emotional Changes precede Delusions

### Agitation in Dementia

- Inferred or observed, sustained emotional distress alongside restlessness, verbal or physical aggression
- Broad clinical usage, can also be used to describe…resistance to care, destruction of property, inappropriate vocalisation, wandering, socially/sexually inappropriate behaviour, anxiety, nocturnal disturbance...
- Very common, distressing, reduces quality of life, often precipitates nursing home/hospital admission (Institutionalisation) and difficult to treat.

### Causes

- Agitation is likely to be multifactorial in cause, arising due to a combination of individual and environmental factors
- Sundowning - Both a Biological and Social Factor - This is where as a condition progresses, some Px may be more agitated/confused in Late Afternoon/Evening in comparison to earlier on in the day
- Sundowning can be caused by Disturbanced in Circadian Rhythms but also due to Social Factors such as Loss of Routine, Changes in Light Levels, Little Sleep etc.
- Agitation can be commonly seen as a Sx of other MH Disorders

![Untitled](%5BCPP2090%5D%20Mental%20Health%20Aspects%20of%20Ageing%20and%20Deme%208ec236bd08654611ba208c84511e04e1/Untitled%202.png)

### Biological

- Memory is affected in Early Disease as Pathology tends to originate in the Structures within the Medial Temporal Lobes
- As the disease progresses, the Locus Coeruleus is one of the First Nuclei to be affected outside of the Medial Temporal Lobe, reducing NA Supply to the wider Cerebral Cortex, where it is involved in Arousal and Emotional Reactivity/Inhibitory Control (Via Projections to the Frontal Lobe + Amygdala)
- Therefore, Early Degeneration of the Locus Coeruleus and altered Noradrenergic Function within the Brain may lead to increases sensitivity and response to Stress, making individuals predisposed to Agitation
- 5-HT System is widespread in the Brain and is important for Mood and Emotional Disruptivity so disruptions to the System in Alzheimer’s Disease can give rise to Impulsivity, Aggression and Agitation
- DA System is important in attributing Significance to aspects of the Environment and Threat Perception - Although it is relatively unaffected in Alzheimer’s Disease,  Alterations to other Neurotransmitter Systems within the Brain can lead to a loss of Modulatory Control over the DAergic System, producing behavioural changes

- Agitation accounts for 44% of the annual health and social care costs of dementia in people living in care homes (UK)

# Psychosis in Alzheimer’s Disease

- Can include Persecutory or Misidentification Delusions, which arise from Delusions and Visual/Auditory Hallucinations
- 4 Main Sx of Psychotic Episodes:
1. Hallucinations
2. Delusions
3. Confused and Disturbed Thoughts
4. Lack of Insight and Self Awarneess

### Causes

- Biological - Loss of Modulatory Control and hence, Overactivity of Central DAergic System via Degeneration of other Neurotransmitter Systems within the Brain

![Screenshot 2022-03-03 at 17.32.49.png](%5BCPP2090%5D%20Mental%20Health%20Aspects%20of%20Ageing%20and%20Deme%208ec236bd08654611ba208c84511e04e1/Screenshot_2022-03-03_at_17.32.49.png)

### Delusions

- There are 2 broad types of Psychosis seen in Alzheimer’s Disease, Determined by the type of Delusions that they experiencing, both caused by Overactivity of DAergic Systems within the Brain
- Persecutory Psychosis = Px believes others are out to harm them (E.g Steal, Harm or Abandon them etc.)
- Misidentification Psychosis = Px misidentifies familiar individuals and believe that they have been replaced/transformed with an ‘imposter’
- E.g Phantom Boarder - Px believes that there is an unwelcome stranger in their home despite evidence to the contrary
- Capgras Delusion = Close Friend/Relative/Spouse has been replaced with an identically looking imposter
- Mirror Sign = Px believes that their reflection within a Mirror is another person and not them (Can be partially due to Prosoprognosia)
- Misidentification Subtype has been associated with more severe Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology and Atrophy of the Parahippocampal Gyrus (Inability to attribute context to stimuli to allow for stimuli to be identified)

# Antipsychotics in Alzheimer’s Disease

- Rx of Agitation and Psychosis in Dementia is with Antipsychotic Medication
- For those with Alzheimer’s Disease, the Therapeutic Window where [Antipsychotic] will effectively manage Sx without causing Side Effects is narrower and achieved at low [Drug] vs that seen or Young Px with Schizophrenia
- This means that in comparison to Younger Individuals, lower doses of Antipsychotic Drugs will be effective and Older Px with Dementia will be more sensitive to side effects

### Guidelines for Antipsychotic Drug Prescribing in Alzheimer’s disease

- Current Advise recommends Antipsychotics as a Last Line vs First Line Rx of Agitation in Dementia
1. Identify target symptoms- delusions, hallucinations, aggression
2. Avoid antipsychotic drug use where possible - consider other factors that may generate, aggravate or ameliorate symptoms
3. Physical screening (pulse, BP, ECG, repeat bloods)
4. Potential risks and benefits of antipsychotic medication should be considered, documented and discussed with the Px/Carers prior to initiation
5. Low doses should be given as older people are more sensitive to severe side effects (parkinsonism, stroke, sedation/falls)
6. Review regularly taking into account therapeutic response and adverse effects
- Only Risperidone has been licensed for Short Term (<6 Weeks) Rx of Agitation

# Summary and Take-Home Messages

1. The biopsychosocial model in ageing can help us to understand the aetiology and management of mental ill-health in older adults.
2. Depression in older adults may have a different presentation to younger adult and may be associated with higher risk of suicide and dementia.
3. VLOSP has similarities and differences vs SCZ in younger adults with specific phenomenological features. Treatment is with low dose antipsychotics.
4. Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur in phases in dementia, supporting the idea that dementia-related brain changes underlie the symptoms.
5. Agitation and psychosis are common symptoms in dementia, distressing and difficult to treat and may be due to disruption of the balance between neurotransmitter systems.
6. Older adults are more sensitive to antipsychotic drugs – use low doses.
