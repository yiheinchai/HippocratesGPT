# [CPP2012] Systematic Reviews

Module: DDS

# Evidence Based Medicine and Systematic Reviews

- In Systematic Reviews, all available evidence on a specific research question (published and unpublished) is collated and interpreted to provide a summary of the evidence to address a focused research question
- EBM = Use of current best scientific evidence in making decisions about the care of Px (in order to provide the highest quality care)
- Out of all research designs, they provide the strongest evidence for a causal association between an exposure and disease outcome

### Systematic Review

1. Pose a focused question
2. Find all the relevant evidence and appraise methodological quality of evidence
3. Summarise the information from all the studies in a Forest plot and then Synthesise the results using Meta-analysis to produce a single result

# PRISMA and Focused Questions

### PRISM

- PRISMA = Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
- Aims to help authors improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Consists of a 27-Item checklist and 4 phase flow diagram, with a focus on systematic reviews of randomized trials (can be used for SRs of other types of research)

### Focused Questions

- PICO:
1. Population of Interest,
2. Intervention (or Exposure)
3. Comparator
4. Outcome
- PRISMA has recently included **S**tudy design

# Summarising the Evidence - Forest Plots

- Results of Systematic Reviews  (Statistical Measures like Risk etc.) are commonly displayed using a Forest Plot
- This summarises the Magnitude of the Intervention Effect (E.g Odds/Risk Ratio) and the 95% Confidence Interval for each of the included studies
- This information is then combined to produce a pooled estimate and 95% Confidence Interval for the Effect Size

### Interpreting Forest Plots

- The Intervention Effect value for a specific study is represented as a blue square with a line through it, along a vertical line
- Vertical Position of Blue Square indicates the trial from which the results were derived and the Horizontal position of the Blue Square indicates the value of the measure of the Intervention Effect
- The length of the Horizontal Line through the blue square indicates the width of the confidence interval
- The x axis is a scale indicating the size and polarity of the measure of the Intervention Effect and there is a vertical line arising from the point Intervention Effect = 1
- Pooled/Combined Intervention Effect (Summary of All Intervention effects) is represented by a Black Diamond at the bottom of the Graph
- For this black diamond, the 2 vertices that are in the same vertical plane indicate the value of the Pooled Effect and the width of the diamond indicate the width of the Confidence Interval
- Pooled Intervention Effect is calculated by taking a weighted average of the Intervention Effects (based on the number of individuals in each study)

# Potential Limitations of Systematic Reviews

### 1) Methodological Quality

- Studies can have varying methodological quality (how many features of an accurate study are followed) which may impact on the accuracy of the results (E.g Concealment of Allocation, use of Intention to Treat analysis etc.)
- The effects of this can be minimised by excluding studies from the Systematic Review that are deemed to be of Low Methodological Quality

### 2) Heterogeneity of Results

- Sometimes studies will vary in their results and hence, will be Heterogenous (E.g If Intervention is beneficial or not and the magnitude of the effect size)
- There can be many reasons for Heterogeneity (What population is studied, Delivery of intervention, drug dose, how and when outcome was measured)
- If there is a high degree of Heterogeneity of Results, you should look at each study for reasons to explain the Heterogeneity and also consider whether a Pooled Estimate can be accurately determined (CI would be very large, making the Pooled Estimate relatively inaccurate)

### 3) Publication Bias

- Statistically significant results are more likely to be published and hence, available when collecting evidence for Systematic Reviews, than statistically non-significant results
- Hence, A focus on published studies may offer over-optimistic views of benefits of treatment
- Publication bias occurs especially for small studies as large studies tend to get published anyway (due to their size)

# Importance of Systematic Reviews

- They can provide an accurate overview of all the evidence regarding a specific question which can be used to directly inform clinical practice
- They can identify when there is poor/insufficient evidence regarding the evidence on a specific topic/research questions
