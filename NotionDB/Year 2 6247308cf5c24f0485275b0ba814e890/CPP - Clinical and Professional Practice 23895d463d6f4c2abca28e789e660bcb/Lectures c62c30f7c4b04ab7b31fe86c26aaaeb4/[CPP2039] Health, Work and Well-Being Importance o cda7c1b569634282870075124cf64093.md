# [CPP2039] Health, Work and Well-Being: Importance of Health on
Work and Work on Health

Module: SDoH

# Work and Health

- Jobs provide financial security, a routine, human interaction, sense of purpose and is often associated with your identity

---

# Recovery

- What does 100% recovery (Is this complete recovery back to state before illness or recovery back to a level where daily functioning is restored E.g can carry out job roles)  - How likely is this after a stroke, MS, losing an eye
- Most clinical research often look at end points such as mortality or discharge from hospital – not very ambitious and doesn’t provide a measure of functional recovery
- Work is a very good marker of function, which is often indicative of good recover

---

# Biopsychosocial Model

- Ignoring social/psychological factors and focusing only on biological risks overall
health
- Health is not just the absence of disease but includes positive social and psychological factors too

### Additional Barriers

- George Engel (psychiatrist 1977)
proposed the biopsychosocial model in
what soon became a landmark event for
understanding medicine as a science
- Flags emerged in 1990s in New Zealand for risk of screening individuals with acute lower back pain.
- It provides a set of factors/aspects to consider additional non-biological factors that may influence the degree of functional impairment seen in Px
- “It is the way an employee copes with an
illness”

- As the duration of time off from work increases, the probability of ever returning to work decreases
- This means that substantial time off work could result in many people not experiencing the health benefits associated with work → It is important to encourage return to work after time off to prevent this

# Carol Black Report 2008 and Adjustments at Work

- Strong association between work, health and wellbeing
- Long term Worklessness is associated with poor health

### Adjustments at Work

- Adjustments can keep people working while they get better so that people remain working and reaping the health-benefits of work but also giving them time to sufficiently recover
- Employers have a duty to take reasonable care over the wellbeing of their employees
- For disabled employees, employers have a legal duty to make adjustments

---

# Purpose of Sickness

- Sometimes being off is needed
1. Recovery from surgery
2. Treatment for cancer/infection
3. To allow someone space and time to engage with mental health treatment
- In these situations, working would be beneficial to health
- Sometimes sickness absence is actively harmful
1. Staying off work for months for simple back pain removes the therapeutic benefit of movement (Simple Problem that could be resolved but has been enhanced by immobilisation/time off)
2. This can worsen depression and a lack of sense of self worth
3. Staying off long enough without recovery can put a job at risk – becoming unemployed for a condition which
could resolve within a few weeks if managed well initially

# Sick Pay

- If eligible, you are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay from the 4th day you’re off sick
- Employers often pay more than this by agreement with employees
- After a certain amount of NHS service you get 6 months full pay and 6 months half pay if off sick
- Many private sector employers have less generous terms
- Employees need to give employers proof they are ill if they are off for more than 7 days - This is in the form of a Fit Note
- Before 7 days, they ‘self-certify’

---

# DWP Work Related Benefits

- Disability Living Allowance for children (DLA) is a tax-free benefit for children under 16 to help with the extra costs caused by long-term ill health or a
disability.
- Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is a tax-free benefit for people aged 16 to 64 to help with the extra costs caused by long term ill-health or a disability.
- Attendance Allowance is a tax-free benefit for people aged 65 or over who have a disability and need someone to help look after them.
- Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you can’t work because of illness or disability.
- Carer’s Allowance is extra money to help you look after someone with substantial caring needs.
- You could also get Carer’s Credit so there won’t be any gaps in your National Insurance record if you have to take on caring responsibilities

# Fit Notes

### Who Needs a Fit Note?

- If you’re off work sick for seven days or less, your employer should not ask for medical evidence that you’ve been ill.
- Many employers have their own self certification forms.
- If they don’t an employee may use an SC2 form from HM Revenue & Customs instead.
- However, many employers insist on a note from the GP for a period of sickness lasting less than 7 days, despite there being no legal obligation for their employee to do so (unless of course
directly stipulated in a contract)?
- If you’re off work sick for more than seven days (incl. Weekends & Bank Hols), your employer will normally ask for a fit note from your GP (Med 3).
- Fit note is the informal name for the Statement of Fitness for Work (Med3 Revised).
- ‘Fit notes’ replaced ‘sick notes’ (old Med3/Med5) from April 6 2010

---

# Revised Med3

- This has been revised as previously, Dr could only say if a Px could or couldn’t work without any additional information on specific functional impairments which can be used to plan rehabilitation schemes to facilitate return to work
- To provide evidence of the advice the doctor has given about the individual’s fitness for work.
- Allows doctors to advise that individuals “may be fit for work” or that they are “not fit for work”.
- Can record details of the functional effects of their patient’s condition so that individuals and employers can consider ways to help the individual return to work.
- Can be hand-written or computer generated and printed out.
- Should be issued by hospital doctors if someone is receiving treatment in hospital, or otherwise by GPs
- Patient can go back to work at any time (including before the end of the fit note) without going back to see their doctor - even if their doctor has indicated that they need to assess them again.
- Must, however, ensure done appropriate functional and clinical assessment.
- Important to discuss with Px what relevant medical information the Px is comfortable with being on the form as the form will be sent to their manager
- When filling out about clinical details, it is important to consider whether the diagnosis could be stigmatising and hence, impact the Px at work after they have recovered (In this case, more general, non-stigmatised, umbrella terms like ‘Mental Health Issues’ may be preferred)
- When choosing ‘May be fit for work’, you can include adjustments which can help the Px return to work as soon as possible without compromising recovery via a realistic recovery plan

# Writing a Fit Note

- Just because you can, does it mean you should → Drs can often feel pressured to write fit notes?
- You may wish to protect your relationship with the patient – you are their advocate but a Px cannot demand an intervention that you do not believe is in their best interest and that of the wider community
- If a patient is stressed at work and feels they need 4 weeks off, is that unreasonable?
- Time off can sometimes be essential to aid rehabilitation and recovery
- Sometimes it never ends and people lose their health and job
- Balancing the two depends on having a plan at the outset
- Things you write on a fit note will be taken seriously
- I’m getting a lot of notes at the moment saying ‘this person should be exempt from wearing a face mask’ for dubious reasons (E.g Asthma)

### Summary

1. If Px needs time off, is there a specific time point in the future when this time off is likely to end
2. Before a complete return to work, is a phased return possible so that the Px can get the benefits of work as soon as possible, to further aid recovery
3. Are there other factors (think of the coloured flags earlier) which could be compromising some aspect of health and function and hence, could be addressed to improve recovery?
