Module: Clinical Skills

# General

1. Look (Deformities, Skin Changes/Discolouration, Muscle Bulk, Swelling and Symmetry)
2. Feel (Temperature, Borders of Joint, Joint Line, Effusions)
3. Test Active and Passive Movement in all planes
4. Special Function Test for Specific Joint Pathology (E.g Ligaments)
5. Follow Up Tests (Proximal and Distal Joints, Neurovascular Supply and Appropriate Imaging or Other Investigations

# WIPER QQ

- Washes Hands & dons appropriate PPE
- Introduces self - stating full name and role, Check Px Details and confirm preferred name
- Permission – obtains consent and uses language that the patient will understand to describe examination
- Exposure – Ensures lower limbs are exposed
- Re-positions – Informs patient that they will be lying back at approx. 45 deg and will be but will be asked to stand and walk during the examination
- Asks patient if they are comfortable
- Asks patient if they are in pain
- Informs patient that if they are in pain to inform clinician and examination can stop

---

# Look

- Ask the Px to Stand
- Inspect both knees from the front, sides and behind
- Inspect for Scars, Muscle Bulk of Quads (Wasting), Inflammation, Skin Changes/Discolouration
- From the Side, check for Fixed-Flexion Deformity (inability to fully extend knee)
- Check for Varus (Bow Leg) and Valgus (Knock Knees)
- Check for Symmetry across both legs

# Gait

- Ask the Px to walk to one side of the room and back
- Look for Valgus and Varus again, Pain on Walking and assess for any gait abnormalities (Scissor walking, Trendelenberg etc.)

---

# Feel

- Ask the Px to Lie down and warn the Px of potentially cold hands
- Assess the temperature of the knee joint bilaterally above, over and below the joint
- Palpate the borders of the patella
- Flex the knee 90° and palpate the sagittal joint line from the Femoral Condyle to the Inferior Patella tendon to the Tibial Tuberosity
- Feel popliteal fossa for a Bayer's Cyst (Cyst in Popliteal Fossa)

---

# Patellar Tap and Fluid Bulge

### Patellar Tap

- Used to assess for Large Effusions
- Grab the Px thigh just above the Patella and push down and then posteriorly to move any effusion under the Patellar Tendon

![examination-of-knee2-460x296.jpg](%5BCPP2028%5D%20REMS%20Exam%20-%20Knee%2034c662d8934641c5b50fea0620e496eb/examination-of-knee2-460x296.jpg)

- Press down on the Patellar to feel for a Patellar Bouncing against the Femoral Condyle (Knee will feel spongy or not move if Effusion is present)
- Do this bilaterally

### Fluid Bulge

- Used to assess for small effusions
- Press down Medial to the Patella and push upwards, laterally along the superior border of the Patella and inferiorly down the Lateral border of the Patella
- When moving inferiorly, look to see if a Medial Fluid Bulge appears on the Medial Side of the Patella (Indicative of Effusion)

---

# Movement

- Assess Active and Passive Joint Movement
- Ask the Px to actively bend and extend their knee as much as possible bilaterally
- Then, ask Px to relax their leg and bend and extend their legs for them (one at a time)
- Whilst testing passive joint movement, place your hand on the anterior surface of the patella to assess for Crepitus

---

# Posterior Sag Test

- Ask Px to bend both knees 90° and bring them next to each other
- Check for Posterior Sag (Tibia will appear to be positioned posteriorly and will sag relative to the Patella)
- This indicates a lack of integrity in the Posterior Cruciate Ligament

# Anterior Drawer Test

- Bend the Knee 90° and place both hands either side of the patella with your index finger in the Popliteal Fossa
- Ask Px to relax Leg
- With your thumb over the Patella, Pull the Tibia forward parallel to the direction of the Femur
- If the Tibia slides anteriorly significantly relative to the Femur, this is a positive sign
- This is indicative of a lack of integrity of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament
- Test this Bilaterally

![anterior-drawer-test-knee.jpg](%5BCPP2028%5D%20REMS%20Exam%20-%20Knee%2034c662d8934641c5b50fea0620e496eb/anterior-drawer-test-knee.jpg)

---

# Collateral Ligament Test

- Flex the Knee to 15° and pick up the Tibia, tucking it under the arm so that the foot is just posterior to the Armpit
- Place one hand on the Medial Aspect of the Patella and apply pressure to the Distal Tibia to push it Medially
- Repeat this Laterally (Hand on Lateral Aspect of Patella and Push Distal Tibia Laterally) and Bilaterally
- If there is sliding of the Tibia laterally or medially, this is indicative of a lack of Integrity in the Lateral and Medial Collateral Ligaments respectively

---

# Close and Follow Up

- Tell Px examination is over
- Thank them
- Ask them if they need help getting changes

### Follow-Up

1. Assess Joints proximal and distal to the Knee and the areas surrounding the Knee
2. Examine the Neurovascular Status of the Knee
3. Consider appropriate imaging and other investigations if necessary
