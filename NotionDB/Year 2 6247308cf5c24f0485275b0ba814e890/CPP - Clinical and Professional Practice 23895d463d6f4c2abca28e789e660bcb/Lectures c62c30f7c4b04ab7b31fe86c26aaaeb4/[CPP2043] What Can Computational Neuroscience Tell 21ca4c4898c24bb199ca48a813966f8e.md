# [CPP2043] What Can Computational Neuroscience Tell Us About Affective Psychiatric Disorders?

Module: Mental Health

# Affective Disorders

- These consist of Mood and Anxiety Disorders
- Mood Disorders include Depression, Bipolar and others
- Anxiety Disorders include Generalised Anxiety, Specific Phobias (Can be acquired due to a Trigger Incident or inherent against threats) and OCD (Obsessions/Intrusive Thought that lead to Distress and Anxiety, with compulsions/repetitive behaviours being carried out to relieve distress)

### Characteristics

- Changes in Mood and Feelings = Key Characteristic Feature
- negative (e.g. depression) vs positive (mania) mood
- sometimes strong somatic expression (panic attack) associated with mood changes
- disturbance of bio-rhythms/Circadian Rhythms (sleep, appetite)
- Changes in cognitive biases and thought patterns also occur

### Importance

- Around 25% of the population affected
among the most impairing disorders (due to their chronicity and subsequent functional impairments and wider socioeconomic effects)
- Depression:
- 300 million currently affected
- 1 in 4 affected once in life.
- 800,000 suicides per year (2nd leading cause of death in 15-29yo)
- Depression is the most common affective disorder
- Most affective disorders are 2x more common in females than men, except OCD (where Incidence is equal in men and women)

# Depression

- DSM-5 criteria (1 of first 2 necessary plus 4 others) for 2 weeks:
1. Dysphoria (i.e. low mood / reverse of euphoria / increased negative feelings),
2. Anhedonia (i.e. lack of positive feelings, reduced anticipatory & consummatory pleasure)
3. Sleep changes
4. Altered weight/appetite
5. Motor changes
6. Fatigue
7. Worthlessness/guilt
8. Lack of concentration/decisiveness
9. Suicidal ideation and thoughts

### Diagnosis by GPs

- Px Health Questionnaire (PHQ 9)

### What Causes Depression?

- Diagnosing/Identifying Sx → Clinicians and Questionaires. Characterised by Low Mood and Anhedionia
- Understanding Mechanism/Impacts on Cognition → Experiments and Observations (Mainly affect Affective Bias)
- Pathophysiology/Neurobiology → Neuroimaging, Drug Studies and Genetics (Likely down to Serotonin Dysfunction)

### Genetics and Depression

- Unipolar depression is somewhat heritable (~30-50%) but is more likely to be acquired
- Bipolar depression is much more heritable (~80%; similar to schizophrenia)
- Bipolar depression and schizophrenia share common genetic effects, both from heritability and association studies
- Several genes of small effect (e.g. serotonin transporter polymorphism) have been identified, that interact with environmental factors (e.g. stress) to produce the disorder
- Polygenic risk scores (Predictive Risk Scores) for depression only explain 1-2% of variance and hence, genetics is not the main risk factor for depression

# Treatment For Depression

- Medication
1. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors
2. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) e.g. Prozac - Shown to be very effective in Rx of Depression (5-HT is therefore very significant in Depression)
- Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT: cognitive schemata) or interpersonal therapy (IPT)
- Ketamine
- Self-remission (surprisingly common)
- Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) - Shown to be effective in Medication Resistant Cases
- Surgery (extreme cases) - Deep Brain Stimulation
- NICE recommended treatment is low intensity (computerised) CBT for mild-to-moderate depression and high intensity CBT + medication for severity moderate or greater

# Serotonin Hypothesis of Depression

- SSRIs work almost exclusively on serotonin
- Serotonin releasing drugs (e.g. MDMA –
ecstasy) improve mood acutely
- Tryptophan depletion (5-HT Precursor) causes acute mood change in recently recovered depressed patients maintained on SSRIs (This is not seen in Px who have not experienced depression before)
- Mild depressive characteristics can be induced in healthy volunteers using tryptophan depletion (e.g. emotional bias)
- Depression is caused by reduced transmission in serotonin nerve tracts

### SSRI Function in Depression

- Metanalyses show that a wide range of SSRIs are effective in the Rx of Depression
- SSRIs do not have an immediate effect, taking around 2 weeks for mood to change and Sx to improve despite acting immediately on synapses

# Cognitive Models of Depression

- Aaron Beck’s rejection of psychoanalysis (focused on “unconscious”)
- Early life events result in dysfunctional negative schemata
- Schemata: Models of the world that provide a framework for the interpretation of new and stored information and give rise to a predictable pattern of reactions to specific stimuli
- These patterns allow for rapid responses to stimuli, allowing responses to be efficient and appropriate
- Cognitive distortions (faulty logic) can arise due to these negative schemata - e.g. overgeneralisation, selectively filtering out positive information
- Selective Abstraction - Drawing conclusions on the basis of just one, of many of the elements of a situation
- In Depression, personalisation is seen so that failures are attributed to a fault in the individual whilst successes are often dismissed as not being due to their own efforts but due to other external factors
- Stressful life events activate schemata
- Negative schemata and cognitive distortions are targeted by psychotherapies such as CBT
- Depression is caused by stable, self-perpetuating dysfunctional negative schemata

# Affective Bias

- Affective (reward) response bias - More likely to respond to stimuli that has been previously rewarded significantly - These are mainly motivational in function
- Affective Memory Biases are also seen - Items that are rewarded are more likely to be remembered better
- Affective perceptual bias: bias towards salient faces, more commonly interpretation neutral faces as more positive/negative

### Reduced Affective Bias in Depression

- There is a specific reduction in reward biases and reward learning (but not response vigour) - They have a reduced positivity bias
- Depression reduces and single-dose, acute antidepressant (reboxetine) increases recognition of neutral or happy faces as being happy, back to the normal level
- Depression reduces and reboxetine increases memory of positive words
- Antidepressants act rapidly, often at short doses, to correct reduced/negative effective bias seen in Depression, which acts slowly to correct mood (Mainly act on Cognition in the Short Term to affect Mood in the Long Term) → Produces time lag in effectiveness of Antidepressants
- After being given Citalopram for 7 days, Px were asked to perform a reward learning & memory task (Shown 2 Pictures, with one of them rewarded more frequently and one rewarded less, with Px having to figure out which was rewarded more)
- ‘Affect boost’: This occurred occasionally using a Wheel of Fortune with big win/loss (produces sudden and high magnitude reward/punishment)
- SSRIs do not enhance learning, memory or acute mood in response to winning/losing but affect-induced learning biases (Following a sudden High Magnitude win from the Wheel of Fortune, there is an increased preference for stimuli that produce reward)
- SSRIs enhance delayed effects of increases in mood triggered by large magnitude wins and reduced delayed effects of decreases in mood triggered by large magnitude losses
- Depleting catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine) in previously depressed individuals resulted in immediate depressive symptoms
- Noradrenaline function also affects affective biases, such as reward-induced memory bias
- This means that there are likely other monoaminergic neurotransmitters involved in Depression, beyond 5-HT

### Non-Monoaminergic Antidepressants

- Ketamine leads to fast-acting anti depressant effects which persist for up to 2 weeks
- Ketamine acts on GABA and Glutamate
synapses via different mechanisms, notably acting on inhibitory interneurons

- Clinical Effects
1. For treatment-resistant depression
2.  Effects quite reliably reproduced: Peak within 24-72h, lasting approx. 1-2 weeks
3. Repeated administration extends duration of effects
4. IV treatment initiated typically 2x/week,
frequency tapered gradually
5.  It produces a very pronounced and acute reduction of suicidal ideation
6. Intranasal (adjunctive - Esketamine) administration, short-term, long-term; FDA (03/2019) & EU approval (10/2019)
- Challenges
1.  Small sample sizes, low quality studies therefore, there is not much data supporting its efficacy
2. Lack of long-term data on efficacy and safety
3. Side effects (particularly long-term) dramatically understudied
4. Acute: anxiety, dissociation, dizziness,
increase BP & HR
5. Chronic: Liver toxicity, ketamine bladder
(cystitis), cognitive impairment, tachyphylaxis, abuse, addiction
6. Difficult/impossible to blind; increased
discontinuation vs. placebo
7. Potentially dangerous off-label use (→ recreational use)

# Summary

- Depression extremely common and most disabling
- depression characterised by dysphoria and anhedonia
- Traditional drug treatment act on monoamines, esp. serotonin
- SSRI assumed to act via normalising affective biases
- novel pharmacological interventions have a lot of potential but unclear mechanisms
- using computational methods and cognitive neuroscience helps uncover the mechanisms underlying affective disorders
