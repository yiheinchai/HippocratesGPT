# Importance of Mental Health in Adolescence

- 1 in 8 young people experience clinically diagnosable mental health problems (higher prevalence than previous years)
- 75% of Adult Mental Health problems start by the age of 18 and hence, interventions in adolescence could prevent the occurrence of a significant proportion of adult mental health issues
- Mental Health accounts for 16% of the Global Burden of disease in young people aged 10-19 yet children and young people receive less than 5% of mental healthcare funding and only around 25% of young people with mental health problems get specialist support
- Whilst we know the prevalence of MH Problems, we do not know if this reflects the experience of MH Problems over the course of childhood and adolescence (whether it is progressive or intermittent etc.)
- When studying Children between 9 months and 14 years (At ages 3,5,7,11 and 14):
1. 41% enduring positive mental health (No MH Difficulties at any assessment points)
2. 46% had mental health problems at 1-3 sweeps/assessments
3. 14% had mental health problems at 4-5 sweeps/assessments
- During the Coronavirus Pandemic, The Prevalence of
clinically significant mental distress rose from 19% to 27% in April
2020, with young people aged 18-24 showing some of the largest
increases
- A survery found that 80% of US University Students
reported that their mental health had been impactednnegatively, with 1 in 5 reporting worsened mental health during the pandemic

### Overview

- Around 60% of people will experience mental health problems during childhood/ adolescence
- Mental health problems in adolescence have longterm costs for the individual, family and society
- There is some evidence that some adolescent mental health problems have been increasing since the start of the pandemic

# Developmental Period

- Adolescence is an important developmental period as Adolescence is Characterised by:
1. Numerous physical, psychological and social transitions
2. Neurological and structural reorganisation in the brain
3. It is a Critical period for learning and adaptation

### Epistemic Trust

- This is an individual’s willingness to consider new knowledge (often culturally relevant) as trustworthy and relevant and hence, integrate it into their lifes to alter their social interactions
- “trust in the authenticity and personal relevance of interpersonally transmitted knowledge. Epistemic trust enables social learning in an ever-changing social and cultural context and allows individuals
to benefit from their (social) environment”
- Important mechanism in the transmission of culturally relevant information and is dependent on the recipient viewing the person conveying the information as trustworthy and that the information is valid
- MH Problems result in a deficit of Epistemic Trust and when this occurs in development, this deficit results in a significant reduction in the ability of the individual to adapt and learn new information

# How to help?

- There is evidence to suggest that support from specialist MH professionals (E.g Psychotherapy) is beneficial
- A cohort study of school children accessing services found that depressive symptoms declined more for those who accessed specialist MH services than for those who did not
- In 80% of Meta-analyses, there was a small significant effect of
psychotherapy

### Evidence-Based Treatments

- However, there is still significant debate surrounding which specific Rx should be used for specific MH Issues and their efficacy.
- There were statistically moderate gains from specific manualised/evidence based treatments when compared to waitlist controls (those who did not receive any Rx)
- The gains were less when a specific manualised treatment was compared treatment to routine care (treatment as usual)
- Dodo Bird Verdict = Analogy to describe a consistent pattern of finding seen regarding literature focused on the efficacy of MH Rx/Psychotherapy:
- Psychotherapy Vs Control = Better
- Psychotherapy 1 Vs Psychotherapy 2 = Little to no Difference
- Therefore, whilst it is known that Psychotherapy is effective, it has not been possible to identify specific types of Psychotherapy that are more efficacious for specific MH Problems than others

### Evidence-Based Treatments - IMPACT Trial

- IMPACT trial of 470 young people randomized to brief psychosocial intervention, CBT or short-term psychoanalytical therapy
- No significant differences in outcomes between conditions
- On average there was a 49-52% reduction in depressive symptoms after 1 year

### How are Good Outcomes Defined for Mental Health Interventions

- Measures of Symptoms and functioning are widely measured
- Measures of Personal growth and interpersonal relationships are much less frequently used
- Therefore, it can be argued that many studies are analysing variables that do not change significantly in the short-term, downplaying the effectiveness of the Rx (E.g In Time Limited Studies, Capacity to understand and manage problems is more easily achievable than changes in Sx and Functioning)
- Youth self-report were only included in about 50% of studies and hence, studies rarely consider the personal view/perspective of the Individual and how that changes with Rx

# Psychotherapies

- There is evidence to suggest psychotherapies benefit adolescent mental health
- There is a lack of evidence of differential effectiveness of different psychotherapies (that specific therapies work better for specific MH conditions)
- There is a need to consider how effectiveness and “good outcomes” are defined as it often is not reflective of the true changes seen over the duration of the study

# What Do We Know About
Treating Adolescent Mental Health Problems

- Referral from Primary Care forms the main route of access to Child and Adolescent MH Services. However, young people from Minority Ethnic Groups are more likely to access compulsory (E.g Education, Social Care/Young Justice) vs voluntary (Health Referral etc.) methods
- Average Waiting time for MH Services = 50 Days but there was is large variation in this
- Compared to younger individuals with less severe MH Problems, those with more severe/harmful MH Problems were less likely to have longer waiting times to receive MH Services (More Severe MH Problem = Shorter Wait for MH Services)
- Mainly, Adolescents Access MH Services for support with Family Relationship Difficulties, Depression, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety/Phobia and Poor Relationship Difficulties

### Assessing Improvement - Reliable Change

- Reliable Change = Amount of change needed to be confident it is not solely due to measurement error
- Using this approach, individuals are classified as Reliably improved vs. no change vs. reliably deteriorated based on their change
- Where multiple measures used, at least 1 measure will need to show reliable improvement and no other measure can deteriorate for the individual to be classified as being overall reliably improved

**Reliable Change Rates in Literature**

- The individual-level change on measures of self-report was 38% reliable improvement, 44% no reliable change, and 6% reliable deterioration when accessing routine MH Care for Depression and Anxiety.
- It has been shown that 27% of Px with MH Difficulties showed reliable spontaneous improvement (Individuals recovered/improved despite not accessing Specialist MH Services) but a greater proportion of Px who access Specialist MH Services show Reliable Improvement

### Summary

- Young people from different groups access services in different ways (compulsory or Voluntary Routes)
- Young people access services for a range of problems, primarily family relationships, depression and anxiety
- Between 35-53% of young people show reliable improvement in depression and anxiety
