# [CPP2070] Sharing Information and Discussing Risk

Module: Clinical Communication

# General Medical Council

- You must give patients the information they want or need to
know in a way they can understand.
- You must work in partnership with patients, sharing with them
the information they will need to make decisions about their
care → This highlights the importance of tailoring information to the individual patient’s needs and circumstances, in order to best
support them to make choices about healthcare.

### Summary of The Evidence

- There is a wealth of studies showing that patients often don’t understand, and can’t recall, information provided in consultations.
- This affects patients’ engagement in treatment, ability to make the decisions that are right for them in their individual circumstances, and sense of control over their own health.
- However, there are known strategies to improve this
situation.

# Purpose of the Consultation

- It is important that the reason for the consultation is clear for all parties, this can often be done by signposting at the start of the consultation such as:
1. “The test results have come back. We will need to spend a
bit of time going through them.”
2. “There’s been a change in your father’s health, that we
need to talk about.”
3. “You’ve come to talk about your options for treatment at
this point.”
- A consultation is most effective if it has an agenda. This sets out:
1. The purpose of the meeting.
2. What will be covered in the meeting.
- This works best if:
1. Everyone knows what the agenda is.
2. Everyone’s items (needs) are included.
3. The agenda clear at the outset.

# Consultation Structure

- The structure of the consultation is the means by which
the conversation is organised in order to accomplish the
agenda in the time available.
- Knowing the structure helps people:
1. Keep track of what has been covered.
2. Remember information (because it is broken down
into sections).
3. Plan when to contribute (e.g. ask questions).
- Effective ways of signalling structure include:
1. Using a ‘news bulletin’ format – headlines then detail.
2. Using signposts to orient the patient.
3. Giving information in manageable chunks.
- E.g. “**There are two treatment options we can discuss
today**. Both will treat your condition, but they have
different side effects. **I’ll go through them one at a time**;
feel free to ask any questions as we go. So **the first
option is**...”

### Sign Posts

- These are statements that orient the patient to what is to follow.
- They can:
1. Inform: e.g. “First of all, I’ll tell you about the treatment and
its side effects.”
2. Invite: e.g. “I’d like you to ask any questions you have and
tell me your concerns about this.”
3. Instruct: e.g. “Tell me about your chest symptoms first, then
we’ll go on to the headaches.”

### Chunk and Check

- Breaking down information into chunks reduces the cognitive
load: it makes information easier to digest, understand and
remember.
- After each chunk, you can do a check as to whether the
patient is ready to move on.
- This check can be verbal (e.g. a question) or non-verbal (e.g.
looking for signs of comprehension or puzzlement in the
person’s facial expression).
- If you are not sure whether the person understands –
although this may sound obvious – avoid just ploughing on in
the hope that it will become clear to the person by the end.

# Calgary-Cambridge Guide To The Medical Interview

- Medical consultations often have a defined structure, including a
series of chronological stages, that reflect the tasks to be
accomplished.
- This defines a set of 5 chronological stages that many
consultations will include, plus two other tasks that occur
throughout the consultation.

# Language

- ‘and what we’ve found is squamous cell carcinoma…’
- Consider this as a means of sharing information about a
medical condition for the first time with a patient.
- How does this relate to the previous points, e.g.
1. Headlines first followed by detail
2. Orient the patient to what is about to follow
3. Chunk then check

### Ways of Improving Understanding Through Language

- Given before new - start with what the person already knows.
- Build up the explanation from there.
- Explain in lay terms first, before any medical jargon.
- Do give the patient the medical names for the condition, treatment, tests (as needed).
- This enables patients to look the information up later, and understand what other health professionals involved in their care are talking about.
- But write the medical names down for the patient to take away.
- If there is a word that has a different meaning in the medical setting and general usage (E.g ‘Capacity’), it is best to avoid using these words as they can be confusing
- To prevent confusion, it is simpler to explain the term in question so that a common understanding can be achieved

# Helping Px to Remember Information

- Providing written information (notes or professionally produced
leaflets).
- Sharing links to trusted websites.
- Copying letters to the patient.
- Providing audio or other recording of the conversation.
- Providing patient access to their medical records.

---

# Summarise

- A summary is a concise recap of key points.
- So far, we have considered a 5-point plan of strategies to help you
share information effectively with patients.
- The points were:
1. Ensure the agenda of the consultation is clear.
2. Signal how the consultation will be organised.
3. Build up the explanation using appropriate language.
4. Augment the consultation with additional ways of helping the
patient remember information.
5. Summarise and consolidate at the end.

# GMC and Risk

- “You must work in partnership with patients, sharing with them the information they will need to make decisions about their care, including their condition, its likely progression and the options for treatment, including associated risks and uncertainties.”

### Defining Risk in a Medical Context

- A risk is the chance that something adverse will happen to you, as a consequence of something else
- There is little consensus about what individual terms used to describe risk mean in terms of the likelihood of the adverse event happening (E.g Very Likely, Occasionally).
- This makes it difficult to use these descriptors in medical
consultations without providing information about the objective
likelihood of the risk.
- Patients need to make informed decisions about their own care. If
your perspective of a side effect being ‘occasional’ is different to the patient’s, they are not adequately informed of the risk
- People’s tolerance of risk is related to likelihood and severity of the adverse event but even with the same likelihood and severity of risk, people’s tolerance of certain inteventions and their side effects depends on their individual circumstances and needs and how these side effects interact with those.
- This means that the perception and meaning of risk to an individual are related to:
1. The likelihood of the adverse event (frequency).
2. The impact of the event (severity).
3. The implications (or consequences) for the individual
person in their unique context.

# Background and Risk

- A person’s perception of risk is related to their:
1. Background knowledge and initial expectations.
2. Feeling of how susceptible they are to the threat.
3. Emotional and behavioural responses to uncertainty.
4. Sense of the balance of both benefits and risks.
- In order to communicate effectively with a patient about risk,
you need to have a good understanding of:
1. The objective nature of the risks.
2. The meaning of the risks to the individual.
3. An awareness that perception of risk is a moving target.
- You will establish some of this:
1. By preparing in advance of the consultation.
2. Through dialogue with the patient in the consultation.

### How to Effectively Present Information about Probabilities

1. Use natural frequencies, not percentages
- E.g. 3 in every 10 people (not 30%). Many people don’t understand percentages.
1. Use small denominators where possible
- E.g. 1 in 10 people (vs. 10 in 100) when discussing risks about individuals.
1. Avoid relative risks
- E.g. ‘twice as big’.
- Both of these risks have doubled:
1. 1/2 people to 2/2 people
2. 1/1,000,000 to 2/1,000,000
- Clearly you need to see the absolute risks (e.g. one in a
million vs two in a million) to understand the likelihood of risk and how different the risks are.
1. Be neutral (i.e. be cautious about positive and negative framing)
- E.g. consider the effect of ‘treatment is very effective: 80% of people recover’ and ‘treatment is disappointing: 20% of people die’ – both used to describe the same treatment.
- Neither alone provide the full picture to the patient in order to support informed decision making.
1. Supplement Information with Pictures:
- E.g Icon arrays present risks to individuals compared to the relevant population.
- Individual people are often represented using person icons or emojis.
- These can be used to show risks of disease and to compare treatments.
- Talking through the visuals helps to explain the risks.
- Providing a copy to take away also aids recall.

# Uncertainty

- When discussing risks, be aware that there are different
types of uncertainty:
1. Uncertainty that can be resolved. For example, by doing more tests to establish whether it is an aggressive or slow moving cancer. The health professional can explain that they can do something in order to get information, which is often reassuring to the patient.
2. Uncertainty that can’t be resolved. So nobody can know, for example, whether the treatment will cure this particular patient’s cancer. The inability to get the information people want is often unsettling for all concerned, so be aware of the importance of empathy.
