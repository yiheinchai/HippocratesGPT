# [CPP2041] Substance Misuse and Addiction

Module: Mental Health

# Addiction and Substance Misuse

### Addiction

- A strong desire to take drug, difficulties in controlling its use, persisting in is use despite harmful consequences.
- DSM-V refers to addiction as Substance Abuse Disorder
- Majority of licit and illicit drug users do not become addicted.
- Of those who have tried a drug and go on to become dependent:
1. 32% for tobacco.
2. 23% for heroin.
3. 17% for cocaine.
4. 15% for alcohol.
5. 9% for cannabis.
- The term ‘Addiction’ is deemed to be stigmatising, indicating complete loss of control → Therefore, only around 20% of Individuals with Substance Abuse Disorder enter treatment
- Addiction is heavily influenced by lifestyle and context in which drug taking occurs → A large number of soldiers in the Vietnam War would regularly take Heroin when abroad but when they returned to the USA, only 5% of them were still addicted

### What’s the Problem?

- Alcohol: 21% of Adults drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week.
- This ↑ hospital admissions → 337,870 admissions due to alcohol 2017/2018
- During this time, there was 5843 alcohol specific deaths
- Tobacco smoking: 150,000 deaths/year → Most common cause of Drug related death in the UK
- Illicit drug use: changing in UK.
- The 3 Most Common Drugs that are abused are Opiates, Cannabis and Cocaine/Crack

### Substance Misuse

- Society does not approve:
1. Use of all illicit drugs.
2. Use of prescribed drugs for non-medical purposes.
3. Use of a drug in particular contexts (e.g. drinking and driving).
- Substance misuse: not a classified psychiatric disorder.

### Use of Medicines for Non-Medical Purposes

- Valium and other benzodiazepines: e.g to come down from ecstasy, to prolong heroin’s effects.
- Ketamine
- Opiate pain killers
- More Americans now die every year from drug overdoses that they do in motor vehicle crashes and majority of those overdoses involve prescription medications.
- Health care providers wrote 259 million prescription for opioid pain medications in 2012 (enough for every American adults to have a bottle of pills).

# Substance Use Disorder

- Classified Psychiatic Disorder defined in DSM-5 (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, 2013).
- Considers each substance separately (e.g. alcohol use disorder).
- Rates each disorder on a continuum from mild to severe.
- Examples: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, hallucinogen, opioid, inhalant, sedative-hypnotic-anxiolytic, stimulant (amphetamine, cocaine), tobacco.
- Gambling is an example of a non substance related disorder (Addictive Disorder)

### DSM V - Alcohol Use Disorder

- A pattern of substance use leading to significant impairment or distress within 12 month period.
- Includes at 2 of a list of 11 symptoms.
- Symptoms:
1. Taking more, for longer than intended.
2. Lack of success in controlling use.
3. Much time devoted to finding and using.
4. Craving
5. Continued use despite social/personal problems.
6. Other important activities given up or ↓.
7. Failure to fulfil obligations.
8. Use in physically hazardous situations.
9. Continued use despite physical/psychological problems.
10. Tolerance
11. Withdrawal
- Severity Ratings:
- Mild: 2-3 symptoms
- Moderate: 4-5 symptoms
- Severe: > 6 symptoms → This was previously known as addiction

---

# Tolerance and Withdrawal

- Tolerance: ↓ effect of drug after repeated administration or ↑ dose of drug required to maintain same effect.
- Withdrawal: signs and symptoms observed when a previously used drug is ↓ in dose or stopped.

### UK Epidemiology

- It is unknown how many people abuse drugs
- Data on drug seizures, arrests and people in treatment all underestimate this figure as stigma and illegality of Drugs means that individuals are less likely to admit to Illicit Drug Use
- Household Surveys provide a better estimate but differences in quantity of alcohol bought and individual rates of alcohol consumption would indicate that 30-50% of Alcohol bought in the UK is never drunk
- Substance use disorder: ~7.5% of adult population.
- Alcohol abuse/dependence: ~6% of adults; twice as many men as women.
- Comorbidity is high (Px often have Depression, Anxiety and other mental health issues)
- Polysubstance use is common

### Cannabis

- Most widely used illicit drug.
- 1% of all EU adults and 1.7% EU 14-17 year olds are now cannabis dependent.
- 25% of new referrals for addiction treatment (EU) are primary cannabis dependence (where cannabis is main drug), 2nd only to heroin dependence (41%).
- Around 50% of 16-year olds in UK have used it.
- 180 million users globally.
- For Px who are receiving first time treatment, there is increased incidence of Cannabis Addiction whilst that for Other Drugs (Opioids and Cocaine notably) has decreased

### Cannabis Dependence

- ↑ due to changing cannabinoid content?
- ↑ THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) varieties cultivated.
- Genetics: seeds chosen for high THC, and negligible CBD (cannabidiol).
- Skunk (Lots of THC) now 80% of UK market.
- CBD could potentially be used as a Rx for Cannabis Addiction.

# Theories of Drug Dependency

- Psychosocial: behavioural, cognitive, motivational.
- Biological
- Integrative: biopsychosocial model.

### Sociocultural Factors

- Rates of alcohol abuse:
- ↑ in poorer areas.
- ↑ with unemployment rates.
- ↓ in some cultural groups (e.g. Jewish) than others (e.g. Irish and Russian men).

### Behavioural Theories

|  | Description | Treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Classical Conditioning | Cues associated with
drug (e.g. smell or sight of alcohol, drinking friends, local pub) become conditioned stimuli, closely associated with the drug use | Exposure of Px to the same cues but prevent response (e.g. having soft drinks at pub) to weaken association between Cue and Response. |
| Operant Conditioning | Drug is a reward and
rewarded behaviour (drug taking) is
repeated. | Community reinforcement
approaches. Reward other
behaviours so drug taking is
no longer primary reward. Also voucher-based system to reward abstinence. |

### Motivational Model

- Derived from the Stages of change (Prochaska & DiClemente, 1985)
1. Precontemplation - Brief thoughts of cessation that are not expanded upon significantly or engaged with
2. Contemplation - Drug Use and its appropriateness/harm are seriously considered but no actions are carried out to aid cessation
3. Determination
4. Action - Initiation of Cessation
5. Maintenance - Maintenance of Cessation
- This produces a cycle of change (Cycle Maintained by relapse, which is common) where success in Cessation/Change allows an individual to leave the Cycle
- This can be Rx by Emotional Interviewing where Therapist helps the Px progress through the Cycle, providing significant support during the Maintenance Stage to prevent Relapse

---

# Cognitive Factors

- Addicts show impairments on tasks of decision making & planning.
- They also have higher impulsivity & do poorly on tasks of behavioural control.
- Memory – especially working memory – is impaired.
- Attention is biased

### Attentional Bias

- Cues associated with Drug grab the user’s attention
- The degree to which they grab attention correlates with Drug Craving and Addiction

---

# Mesolimbic Dopamine Pathway and Other Brain Pathways

- Drugs hijack brain’s natural reward pathway.
- Addicted Brain shows more impulsivity/less behavioural control
- The main pathways affected in the Brain are involved in Reward Prediction and Pleasure, Cognition Control, Motivation Drive and Salience Attribution and Learning and Memory

- Drugs Hijack the Mesolimbic Dopaminergic System

### Drugs and Dopamine

- Cocaine and amphetamine exert primary effects on dopamine.
- Some other drugs act indirectly to facilitate dopamine release.
- Specific receptors for some drugs (e.g. opiates, cannabis) and endogenous ligands that act on those receptors (e.g. endorphins-opioids, anandamide and 2AG – cannabis).
- Dopamine D2 receptors particularly implicated in addiction.
- Cocaine users have ↓ D2 receptor density in striatum.
- Low D2 receptor density in striatum is a vulnerability factor for stimulant dependence.

### Prefrontal Cortex Changes in Drug Dependency

- ↓ glucose metabolism in frontal cortex.
- Volume Loss
- This is associated with Cognitive impairment:
- Poor inhibitory control.
- Poor decision making and planning.
- Memory impairment

---

# Biological Theories

- There is a genetic predisposition for alcohol dependence - Concordance rates: 0.40 monozygotic twins; 0.32 dizygotic twins *(Prescott & Kendler, 1999)*
- Other evidence of genetic factors: Pharmacological challenge with opiates or NMDA antagonists – healthy relatives of alcoholics like these drugs more than healthy non-relatives (Petrakis et al, 2004).

---

# Treatment

### Pharmacological Treatments

- Drug Replacers: methadone (Heroin Replacement), nicotine, e cigarettes.
- Sensitizers: disulfiram (Antabuse) → Produces negative Sx when drug is taken (Drug becomes punishing vs rewarding, reversing Operant Conditioning).
- Blockers: opiate antagonists, like naltrexone.

### New Approaches

- Destabilise and Replace Drug Memories (notably in Alcohol Dependency)
- Target the Endocannabinoid System

### Biopsychosocial Model

- Changes in cognitive, emotional and motivational processing
- Genes and the Environment influence how individuals respond following initial usage of the drug
- When someone has Serious Addiction, the Drug itself will produce neurobiological changes (Often changes in receptor expression), which lead to Dependence

## Goals of Treatment

### Drug Related

- Abstinence or controlled/limited use.
- Harm reduction (often by manipulating the form that they are administered in)

### Non-Drug Related

- ↓ of psychological and social problems.

### Integrative Treatment

- Drug dependence involves biological, cognitive, motivational, behavioural and social components.
- Treatment can best address all these components (biopsychosocial view).

---

# Barriers to Treatment

### Major Treatment Barriers

- Only around 20% of people with substance abuse/dependence problems enter treatment.
- Brief interventions in primary care or A&E ↓ alcohol intake by 30%.
- New approaches: web-based interventions.

### Cost-Effectiveness of Treatment?

- USA: every $1 saves $4-8 in crime and healthcare costs.
- UK: every £1 saves £3-6 in crime and healthcare costs.

### Effectiveness of Treatment?

- Relapse rates remain very High

---

# New Approaches to Treatment

### Public Health Initiatives

- For alcohol: relative price has ↓ over decades, minimum unit pricing.
- Environmental cues: e.g. packaging and advertising.
- Availability controls.
- Labelling/warnings: ‘drinkaware’ controls this in UK.
- Drinkaware is funded by alcohol industry (bias/conflict of interest), meaning that public advice regarding alcohol usage is given by the companies that provide the alcohol.

---

# Prevention

- Drug policy initiatives to reduce harms
- make less harmful products/forms of the drug available e.g. wide range of nicotine delivery systems.
- reduce availability; e.g. alcohol: minimum unit pricing; remove from supermarkets.
- legalise illicit drugs – state control rather than criminal control of the market?  This could produce healthier products e.g. cannabis <THC and >CBD, which reduces addiction and other mental health issues such as Psychosis.
- If drug supply is state controlled, harm reduction advice can be provided at purchase e.g. Benefits of edibles over smoking or risks associated with IV use.
