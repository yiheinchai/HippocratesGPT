# Community Placement 1 - See Differently (Robin Spinks)

# Medical Models

- Experience of blindness and its functional impacts are drastically different for those who were born visually impaired and those who were previously sighted and lost their vision
- Medical Model implies that functional impairments arise from malfunctions in normal physiological functions.
- This pathologising of Impairments can be a source of stigma and discrimination

# Story

- Blind guy on holiday, mum taken into hospital so having to come back to UK
- Unable to see the physical condition of his mother (felt powerless)
- Unable to see medical equipment around him and hence, where he could walk without hurting himself so he felt paralysed.
- Man unable to access information to support bereavement (registering death, planning funeral etc.) as he was given printed pamphlets
- Therefore, the man was unable to access resources to support his bereavement and as a result, felt isolated and alone
- Important to ensure children are aware of disabilities and their functional impairments to normalise disability and remove stigma.
- This ensures that individuals with disabilities are integrated into society and supported to minimise the functional impairment of their disability on their daily life

# Meeting, Greeting and Guiding

- Important to exaggerate/heavily involve other senses (Explaining more, touch if need etc.) as non-verbal skills are less effective and ask the Px if they need assistance
- Be specific with words ('Its over there', start and end of activities etc.)
- If Guiding Px, use shoulder or arm to guide (don't use their hand unless they need) and always ask for permission before bodily contact to ensure it is appropriate
- Social Distancing impacted blind people and added to anxiety already present with moving around

# Summary

- Sight loss is a spectrum and as a result, visually impaired people have varying needs (Support reading or help guiding)
- Some individuals (mainly those who have been recently Dx/recently lost sight) might find visual language discomforting but most people who have adjusted to their visual loss use this language and are comfortable with it ('Did you look at/watch this')
- Sensory overload is sometimes common in visually impaired people (often auditory) which further provides a functional impairment on top of that provided by the Vision Loss
- Consistency is key for normal functioning of many visually impaired individuals as they often depend on mental plans of the spacial location of objects to perform actions quickly

# Humzah's Notes

- Blindness and Low Vision: Practical strategies from a lived experience perspective
- Globally at least 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment.
- Leading cause of Vision impairment are uncorrected refractive error and cataracts
- Theres a big difference in having sight and losing it, than having sight loss from childhood.
- Someone who loses their sight probably has more negative experiences, having a sense of bereavement every time they wake up
- There’s things they used to be able to do that they can’t do anymore

### Models of Illness

- Medical: The reason someone is disabled, their medical problem. The treatment is to find a medical solution. Can be dehumanising, inferring there’s something wrong with them
- Social: Suggests its the attitude of society and the way we designed the world that effectively disables someone
- Volunteering with different groups allows you to see barriers that they would see. Musa Salaam said the same thing
- Biopsychosocial: A mixture of both
- Eye conditions vary a lot, and the effect on the person can vary as a result. Noticing a deterioration can be very scary.
- Degenerative vs static conditions, some can fluctuate. Congenital, acquired, other health issues
- Dimensions and layers of illness can compound, exacerbating symptoms and feelings of hopelessness
- Sensory overload, despite one sense being limited
- In a bereavement scenario, he was given pamphlets, not even able to access critical help. Big life events can be made even more difficult with disabilities
- Going through genetic counselling when having a kid
- Teaching kids when they grow up around disability about the challenges it brings produces brilliant, sensitive individuals!
- In a consultation with a visually impaired person: Introduce yourself, explain reasoning for consultation, ask if they need any assistance. Make it clear when you are leaving
- Always ask, never assume
