# [CPP2077] Neurological Sensory Examination

Module: Clinical Skills

# WIPER QQ

- W - First wash your hands and don appropriate PPE
- I - Introduce yourself to patient, including your name and grade/position
- P - Explain that you wish to perform an assessment of the nerves and sensation in the lower limbs and obtain consent for the examination. Explain that part of the examination will require you to look around the bed.
- E - Ideally the patient should be undressed down to their underwear, exposing their lower limbs. Take care to ensure the patient is not cold or unnecessarily embarrassed. They can remain fully dressed from the waist up.
- R - Position patient and ensure adequate privacy. In this examination you will need to recline the patient back to 45⁰ or have them lying flat to examine their legs.

---

# Inspection

- Look at the end of the bed and assess whether they look comfortable/uncomfortable and well/unwell
- Look around the bed for any evidence of medication, splints and mobility aids.
- Then stay at the end of the bed or move to your patient’s bedside and perform a closer inspection of their lower limbs.
- Remember to verbalise that in a full examination you would also inspect the backs of their legs.

| D | Deformity – are there any obvious deformities of note? |
| --- | --- |
| W | Wasting – is there any evidence of muscle wasting or loss of muscle bulk? |
| A | Asymmetry – compare like with like |
| R | Rashes – are there any rashes or overlying skin changes? |
| F | Fasciculations – are the muscles contracting inappropriately?
    |
| S | Scars – are there any scars indicative of previous surgery or trauma |

# Overview

### Four Key Domains

| Domain | Tract |
| --- | --- |
| Light Touch | Anterior Spinothalamic Tract |
| Pain/Temperature | Lateral Spinothalamic Tract |
| Vibration | Dorsal Column |
| Proprioception | Dorsal Column |

# Light Touch

- To assess light touch, use a wisp of cotton wool.
- Ensure that the patient is first able to feel the cotton wool.
- Do not drag the cotton wool across the skin as this can be interpreted as Nociception
- This can be done by asking the patient to close their eyes and gently touching the sternum.
- Ask the patient if they are able to feel this sensation.
- Then explain that you will do exactly the same assessment in various parts of the leg.

- Take a step-by-step approach to the assessment of the limbs, ensuring to assess light touch in each of the dermatomes
- As you need to assess like for like, assess the same dermatomes on each limb before moving on
- Ask the patient to keep their eyes closed at all times and simply say “yes” each time they feel the cotton wool.
- Also ask if there is any different in the touch sensation produced over each dermatomes

- Ask the patient to keep their eyes closed at all times and simply say “yes” each time they feel the cotton wool.

# Pain/Temperature

- Pain sensation is assessed using a “neuropen” - Not neurotips as they can easily puncture the skin.
- It is important to note, and reassure your patient that this part of the examination does not cause pain.
- Instead, we assess the patient’s ability to sense a sharp stimulus, which does not pierce the skin.
- As with light touch, begin by testing the sensation on the sternum.
- Ask the patient if the stimulus feels sharp.
- Then assess each dermatome in turn as before.

- This time, ask the patient to say “sharp” each time they feel the stimulus. Ensure their eyes are closed.

- Temperature sensation can be used to assess the same sensory system as both stimuli are carried along the lateral spinothalamic tract.
- Instead of a neurotip, use a cold or hot stimulus, ensuring to first assess sensation on the sternum.
- There is no need to assess both pain and temperature as the information gathered is about the same tract.

# Vibration

- To assess vibration sense, use a 128Hz tuning fork.
- Strike the tuning fork against your palm, or flick between your fingers in order to cause the initial vibration.
- Place the base of the tuning fork on the patient’s sternum and ask if they can feel it vibrating.
- Then place your hand on the top of the tuning fork to stop the vibrations.
- Ask the patient if they can sense that the vibration has stopped.

- Repeat this on the lower limbs.  This time, do not assess each dermatome in turn.
- Ask the patient to close their eyes and say “yes” when they feel the vibration of the fork.
- Place the vibrating tuning fork at the bony prominence of the distal phalanx of the great toe
- Ask the patient to tell you when the vibration stops before placing your hand over the top of the fork.
- Repeat on the other side.
- If the patient is unable to sense the vibration at the distal phalanx, move proximally until it can be felt (i.e. over first MCP joint, then the medial malleolus, etc.).

# Proprioception

- Proprioception is assessed using the great toe.
- Hold the distal phalanx on the side with one hand separate from the other toes and use the other hand to move the toe up and down.
- Whilst the patient watches, demonstrate what is an “upward” movement, and what is a “downward” movement.
- Then ask the patient to close their eyes, and repeat the movements in a random fashion, asking the patient to say “up” or “down” depending on the movement they sense.
- If the patient is unable to sense movement using the great toe, assess using movement of the ankle in a similar motion.

- It is useful to then say that you would conclude the examination by performing a Lower Limb Motor examination, an examination of the Cranial Nerves, and an Upper Limb Motor and Sensory Examination.
