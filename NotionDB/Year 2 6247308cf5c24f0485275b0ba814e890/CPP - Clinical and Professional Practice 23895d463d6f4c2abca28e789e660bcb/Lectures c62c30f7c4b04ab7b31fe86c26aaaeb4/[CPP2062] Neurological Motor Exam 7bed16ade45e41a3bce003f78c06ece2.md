- Romberg’s Test (Evidence of Sensory Ataxia) → As Px to stand in front of a seat with their feet together, Arms outstretched in front of you, initially with their eyes open and then with their eyes closed
- While doing this, ensure that you arms are placed in front and behind the Px in case they fall

# Muscular Assessment - Tone

- Assess Muscle Motor Function using acronym ToP CaR

T**one**

o

P**ower**

C**oordination**

a

R**eflexes**

- Px should be lying on the bed for the rest of the examination
- All tests should be done on both side to identify unilateral or bilateral pathology

---

# Tone

- Ask Px to completely relax
1. Leg Roll - Place your hands on the Px thigh and gently roll from side to side
- You should look at the Px’s foot to see whether it moves appropriately with motion

1. Leg Lift - Lift the Px’s Right Knee off the couch (bend their leg) and release/drop
- Leg should return to original/starting position
- Assess for any evidence of Spasticity (Inability to lift leg) or prolonged amount of time in returning to the starting position

1. Clonus - Muscular Spasm involving repeated, rhythmic contractions (Seen in Multiple Sclerosis)
- Bend Px knee to 45 degrees and allow their knee to flop to the side
- Hold the lower portion of the Leg with one hand and the ball of the foot with the other
- Gently rotate the ankle along its Joint in three small circles before abruptly Dorsiflexing the Foot,
- Hold this position for 5 seconds (up to 2 contractions/flaps of the foot is normal but more than this indicates clonus)

# Power

1. Hip Flexion - Put your hand on the Px’s Quadriceps and ask them to push up against your hand/Ask Px to lift leg

1. Hip Extension - Ask Px to lift their leg up and place your hand underneath Px’s hamstring. Ask them to push down into the bed

1. Knee Extension - Ask Px to bring both of their heels towards their bottom/bum
- Place one hand on/above the knee and the other on the distal portion of their lower leg
- Ask the Px to kick out against your hand/try to straighten their leg

![Untitled](%5BCPP2062%5D%20Neurological%20Motor%20Exam%207bed16ade45e41a3bce003f78c06ece2/Untitled%208.png)

1. Knee Flexion - Start with both heels placed near the Px Bottom
- Place one hand on the Back of the knee/top of the Calf and the other over the Achilles’ tendon. Ask the Px to try and pull your hand towards their bottom
- To make the exam smooth, do Knee Flexion and then Extension one after each other on the same leg, sliding the distal hand from the Achilles Tendon to the Anterior Surface of the Ankle when testing Flexion and Extension

1. Ankle Dorsiflexion - Ask Px to completely straighten their legs
- Ask Px to point their toes towards towards the Bed and place the palm of your hand on the dorsum of the foot
- Ask them to resist you pushing each foot down in turn

![Untitled](%5BCPP2062%5D%20Neurological%20Motor%20Exam%207bed16ade45e41a3bce003f78c06ece2/Untitled%2010.png)

1. Ankle Plantarflexion - Ask Px to point their feet towards the floot.
- Place hand on the Plantar Surface of the Foot and ask them to resist you pushing each foot up in turn

![Untitled](%5BCPP2062%5D%20Neurological%20Motor%20Exam%207bed16ade45e41a3bce003f78c06ece2/Untitled%2011.png)

1. 1st Metatarsal Extension - Ask the Px to point their first/big toe to the top of the bed an ask them to resist you pushing it down

- Power is graded according to the Medical Research Council Scale (MRC) - This ranges from 0-5

# Coordination

- Important to give clear instructions as this task can be confusing
1. Ask Px to lie on the couch with their legs outstretched
2. Place your hand (with Palmar Surface facing down) 30 cm above their foot
3. Ask the Px to bring the heel of their left foot onto their right knee, then run their heel down their shin and then up to kick your hand (explain its a loop)
4. Ask the Px to repeat this at least 3 times
5. Repeat on the other side

# Reflexes

1. Knee Jerk - Px should be reclined on the couch and ask them to completely relax
- Place your hand/arm hand under the knee of the leg you are testing (rest your hand on their other knee/Quadriceps)
- Ask the Px to allow you to take the full weight of their hand so that their knees are slightly bend and relaxed under your arm
- Identify the lower portion of the Patella tendon (Just distal to the knee cap) and strike with the tendon hammer
- A normal response will elicit contraction of the Quadriceps to produce extension

![Untitled](%5BCPP2062%5D%20Neurological%20Motor%20Exam%207bed16ade45e41a3bce003f78c06ece2/Untitled%2016.png)

1. Ankle Jerk - Ask the Px to bend their knee to a 45 degree angle and allow their knee to flop to the side
- Ask the Px to relax and hold their foot in dorsiflexion (Pull the ball of their foot using your left hand)
- Strike the back of the Px’s achilles tendon with the tendon hammer
- This should produce contraction of the Calfs to produce Plantarflexion

![Untitled](%5BCPP2062%5D%20Neurological%20Motor%20Exam%207bed16ade45e41a3bce003f78c06ece2/Untitled%2017.png)

1. Plantar Response/Babinski Reflex - With the Px legs outstretched on the couch, use an Orange Stick
- Start at the heel of the foot and with firm pressure, run the stick on the lateral border of the sole of the foot and under the toes
- Normal Response = Toes flex and the foot plantarflexes
- Positive Babinski Sign = UMN Lesion - Produces Fanning of the toes and extension of the first metatarsal
- If any of the reflexes are absent, you should ask the Px to grit their teeth or clench their hands to see if reflexes improve
