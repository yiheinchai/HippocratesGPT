# [CPP2061] Evaluation in the Digital Environment

Module: DDS

# Technology and Innovation

- **Health Innovation:** develop
and deliver new or improved health policies, systems, products and
technologies, and services and delivery methods that improve peopleâ€™s health.
(Process Focused)
- **Health Technology:** Application
of organized knowledge and skills in the form of devices, medicines, vaccines,
procedures and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of lives. (Product Focused)
- When considering these forms of Healthcare support, it is important to consider where in Healthcare these innovations and technologies are used, what level of prevention are they involved in and who is their target

# Drug Development Pipeline

1. Potential drug targets are identified by  basic science
2. Preclinical animal testing of drugs
3. Phase I - First-in-man testing using a small number of Px to look at Safety
4. Phase II - Looking at effect of Drugs in subgroups and different doses
5. Phase III - Efficacy trials
6. Approval by regulatory bodies, e.g. FDA, EMA, MHRA

- Drug regulation has many roles including:
1. Patient safety 
2. Appropriate healthcare provision (Good Healthcare Outcomes)
3. Effective, high-quality treatment

# Medical Devices

- EU regulation classifies medical devices as non-diagnostic (Class I-III) or diagnostic (Class A-D).
- Class 1 non-diagnostic devices (E.g Wheelchairs, Stethoscopes and Spactacles) and Class A diagnostic devices (e.g Analysers and Culture Media) are self-certified and do not need approval as they are low risk.
- Any device which is higher risk needs a clinical investigation, usually a trial.

# Digital Health Technology

- The broad scope of digital health
includes categories such as mobile health (mHealth), health information technology (IT), wearable devices, telehealth and telemedicine, and personalized medicine.
- This is different to other types of healthcare technology as it involves:
- Utilises Lots of Data
- Security of Data as it is recorded by Px and then sent to HCPs
- Who Owns the Data
- Advanced analytics
- More IT Infrastructure
- Considers Health/wellness as well as disease
- Primarily used in the Private sector/public sector/individuals
- Potentially more rapidly changing technology

# Assessing Digital Health Technology

- The effectiveness of Digital Health Technology can be assess by Interventional Studies (Ideally RCT) assessing its accuracy and effectiveness and analysis of results from the technology to look at Specificity/Sensitivity (Few False Positives and Negatives) and Cost Effectiveness
- There is no current mandatory guideline that must be followed to evaluate Digital Health Technology

---

# Summary

- There are established frameworks for
evaluating drugs and devices
- Digital health technologies have
important differences but also similarities
- Still debate about how to evaluate
digital health technologies
- We do need evaluation of effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness of all health technologies
- Doctors need to be able to critically
appraise technology because the scale of digital health technology is much
larger and there are many more questions from patients, clinicians

---

# SBA Information

- Risk Prediction Tools are statistical vs medical technology and hence, do not need regulation unlike other types of Tools used in Clinics
- Diagnostic and Non-Diagnostic Medical Devices are not classified in the same way but are evaluated based on Risk to Px
